I  miss the standard Lego bricks--the twos, fours, and eights of my childhood with a few windows and wheels--that didn't need instructions to make fun stuff:  from the name of this, I thought that was what this one was however, this comes with lots of instructions.  Sure, you can make cool stuff, but it still ties you to the  plans rather than liberates you into the possibilities of undesigned construction.  I would love to find a big box of basic lego bricks so I can make what I want, rather than what Lego wants me to make.\n"", '\n  So in trying to give a ""chest full O\' legos"" as a gift to a niece I discovered what I was aiming for would cost thousands of dollars if I bought it from lego. After scouring the internet for a weekend I settled on buying a ton of usa made, but CHEAP, not lego ""legos"" that were sold here on amazon and fit just fine with actual legos. I wound up finding 1000 mixed size building blocks for around 20 bucks. Through lego anything even close cost around or over 100 dollars and wouldn\'t have contained many actual building blocks.Finding anything sold by lego that had a good mix of building blocks and ""flavor"" or ""special"" connecting blocks, like axles and windows/doors, was impossible. It was mostly the special or flavor pieces and only ever a handful of proper building blocks. The only set that contained a majority of building blocks had somewhere around 1500 pieces but it cost over 150 bucks!In the end I bought this set solely as a ""special"" and ""flavor"" lego set. It gives you some axles, a door, and enough oddball and unique pieces that you can actually turn some building blocks into something other than just a tower. You can build a handful of things listed in a pamphlet that comes with it but after that the options are pretty limited without some real building blocks to throw into the mix.To sum up this is a great addition to a collection solely because there are not many other options out there that don\'t cost an arm and a leg and which also have as many unique pieces. Buy this and a couple of bags of cheap off brands and you\'ve got a good start on a collection. Oh, and don\'t forget the extra large base boards!\n', ""\n  The Lego Creative (Medium) Creative set comes to in a nice plastic storage box. I knew what was included, so I cannot blame Lego. There are simply not enough basic bricks to build with.  I have uploaded several pictures for your review. When all is said and done, you are left with a lot of extra room in your storage box. For us, this was okay, but if your little builder wants to build a house, you may want to check out the Lego Education Basic Brick Set. That set has a lot of building bricks. This set has more specialty pieces, such as wheels. Overall, a great quality product. Lego never disappoints in that regard. This set may disappoint you IF you don't realize exactly what you are getting. I think my pictures will help you there! As you can see, there aren't many basic bricks.\n"", ""\n  This set comes with a variety of 484 Legos. They are separated into bags and placed into this yellow plastic bin. Once you open the bags, it would probably take up one fifth of the bin. Do not think this bin is coming filled to the top, that would be hundreds of dollars.  The bin itself would be great for storage if you needed.  I am planning on saving it for their Lego themed birthday party to set up paper plates or silverware in.This is a classic set nostalgic to the bins I had as a child. I am a fan of Lego in general, I like their kits because they allow my 5 and 3 year old to create trains, cars, etc that look cool and are fun to play with.  These classic kits allow for their Imaginationon to run wild as they dig in.This set came with 35 colors.  I was happy with the assortment of pieces, some of the smooth finishing pieces, ramps, dot pieces, grated pieces.  It had a selection of wheels and hubs, tiny size and medium.  Without the tires you can create train wheels.  There were several small black windows, without shutters or panes.  And one tiny arch window that is pictured on the front.  There's also the smooth dot eyeballs.  This kit contained a few base plates, the largest was 8x16.  Also a brick separator, which is really cool device so you don't have to use your teeth.Right now we are getting these classics sets to bulk up my kids collection for free building.  I do like this medium set for the variety it contains.  I have read that you shouldn't pay more than ten cents per Lego (accounting for differences in variety of sizes).  This kit retails for $30, so with that little thought in mind it is a great price and variety.I also recommend the the $20 Lego classic bright box.  It contained great colors, and didn't have wheels or windows- mostly building bricks.if you are just getting started with Legos- buy it.  If you need a gift for a Lego lover- buy it.  If you want to add on to your/your child's collection- buy it.  Getting more Legos can never be wrong, especially when they build your child's imagination and keep them busy for hours!\n"", ""\n  I got this box of legos for my students to use during indoor recess. The container is sturdy which is great for how many students will be handling it. The lid attached sturdily. My only complaint is that the size of the box is very misleading. If you look at the photo I attached, the pieces it comes with barely even fills the container halfway. I still think it's a pretty good deal for the container plus the pieces. I guess it leaves room for me to fill with more lego pieces as I buy more.\n"", '\n  Significantly overpriced for what was in it. Not an assortment of LEGOs as the name ""Creative Brick Box"" would lead you to believe. It is actually just several small LEGO model projects, with specific pieces meant for that specific model and not the general 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 2x4, and 2x8 pieces like I expected. Other than being overpriced for what you\'re getting, there is nothing inherently wrong with the product, just not what was expected from a box boasting the number of pieces and the creativity of it.\n', '\n  The very first review for this Lego set, claims that this set is full of ""useless pieces"". How ridiculous, Lego does not have any useless pieces, they may not be the pieces that one wants but like a puzzle, Lego is meant not only to recreate what is in the Lego instruction booklets but also (and more importantly I would argue) what is in your mind. Work with what you\'ve got in front of you, there are lots of possibilities.I just gave this box to my 4 and 5 year olds and they are having a ball with it. They don\'t seem to feel limited at all. They are building cars and trees and little shacks and tomorrow, it might all be the same or it could all be something new. With all their other existing Lego, the possibilities will grow again.I am 46 yrs old and Lego was my favorite toy for years and years as a boy. Since I have exposed my kids to it, it has become their favorite as well. No one will convince me that a toy that spands 46 yrs in my case and longer still for others, has any ""useless pieces"" in it.Even the price is ""liveable"" considering how long it can hold a child\'s interest over time.Lego rocks and it just keeps getting better!\n', '\n  For most neurotypical kids this would not be an issue but my 15 year old autistic son has been sitting and staring at the ghost he was trying to make for days now because of the one missing piece. We were supposed to have 4 of the light blue Legos but there were only 3 in the box. Word of caution for other parents with special needs children...\n', '\n  My son loved it big box which is good to put more lego in\n', '\n  Como la mayoría sabemos, la marca es calidad garantizada, y el precio de promoción es excepcional, mi hijo está sumamente contento con su nuevo juguete, y yo como padre estoy muy satisfecho con éste artículo que favorecerá su creatividad e imaginación, sin duda alguna es un juguete infaltable para cualquier infante, potencia su inteligencia. Estoy realmente contento con dicho artículo y no dudo en recomendarlo a plenitud, ningún pero.Gracias por leer ésta breve review, espero que te sea útil, saludos.\n', ""\n  I stupidly missed out on the Walmart deal on Lego brick boxes last Christmas (about half the price of this per brick), but wanted to get a box for the kids to add to their lego collection. This was about the next best thing price-wise per brick that I could find so got a box.The brick boxes are reasonable value compared to the price of normal sets and the kids like to sit and build stuff using their imagination rather than just following plans. BUT...packaging if you have Lego storage already is kind of annoying - I've paid a premium for the plastic packaging box on this, which went right in the recycling as we don't need it. Would be nicer to see it just packaged in a cardboard box, and be $5-$10 less in price.Overall these sets are a decent value way (when on sale) of getting a decent quantity and variety of bricks and pieces, but please Lego put it in a cardboard box and make it cheaper/less wasteful.\n""]"

There are hundreds of comments about this on blogs, comments, reviews, etc. on any number of sites. It is really bad business not to listen to your customers. We are already getting price gouged.

Let 3rd parties buy old product and throw pieces randomly in boxes.We want regular building blocks. Enough with the games.\n"", '\n  ++ Observations:* The box isn\'t good as Lego storage -- a few pieces are small enough to fall through the hole on the bottom. I do advise buying a separate Lego organization solution.* The diversity of pieces is a little thoughtless, and there aren\'t enough basic pieces of any one color. I purchased an extra ""Lego Creative Supplement"" package, and still had trouble getting enough pieces for the wall and roof of the home. The kinds of pieces available to any color is also a little capricious. I wish they removed some of the colors and just gave more basic pieces.* The sole green base plate it comes with is small, and I\'m surprised there isn\'t at least one more base plate.++ Verdict:I wanted to take out my wallet and convert money into an ideal classic Lego introductory experience, but alas, this large classic box, even with a creative supplement, lacked the right quantity of basic pieces. I ended up going to the Lego website to buy large bundles of basic pieces in just a few basic colors, and the price was surprisingly reasonable.\n', '\n  The Good:- Pieces and new and clean (I bought a general pack off eBay and the legos were dirty so I just threw away)- Large LEGO plastic box for storage- Decent variety of pieces but not many large onesThe Bad:- For the price I would have liked more pieces- Not enough wheelsThe Bottom Line:I needed more general LEGO pieces since our son was starting to take apart his creations to build other stuff. I first tried to buy used pieces off eBay but had a bad experience in that they were dirty. These pieces were new and clean but for this price I would have thought there would be more. Overall if you want new pieces then this is one of the few sets with general pieces you can find.\n', '\n  Lego classics are awesome!  I am somewhat partial, I loved Legos as a child and these classics remind me of my Lego buckets.  I\'m guessing Lego responded to public demand for something other than a kit to build a specific item.Lego in general are educational, the kits have taught my 5 and 3 year old to follow directions without having to read and the larger kits have provided us with fun family time.  This collection will inspire them to use their imagination to build whatever they please in whatever color they wish.I have attached two pictures to show how the bricks are bagged and the back paper of the exact bricks you will receive.  Several windows, doors, baseplates, wheels, ramps, dots, building bricks, smooth finishing pieces - see picture for exact color and number of each piece.The yellow storage brick is also nice if you do not already have a place for your Legos.  I am planning on using it as decor for their Lego themed bday party.  If you are looking for other Lego storage options, ikea trofast drawer system was an inexpensive way to organize by color.If you are just getting introduced to Legos, do not expect it to be full once the bags are opened and dumped.  You will receive 790 pieces and this retails for $60.  At the Lego rule of 10 cents per Lego, this seems to be a great deal.  This box full of Legos would be hundreds of dollars.Lego has been around for generations so there isn\'t a question of durability or craftsmanship.  If you need an activity for your children, looking to add to an existing set, giving a gift for a Lego lover this set will be a perfect choice.  Anyone who gets involved with Legos knows the obsession that follows to have more bricks, so just add on!I also recommend the classic bright set, that was a great purchase to add the ""girl"" colors to my boys collection of stereotypical boy colors.  The classic medium set was ok, but I probably wouldn\'t purchase that again, I would get the bright set or this large box again.\n', '\n  We love LEGO but this purchase was a bit of a disappointment from the standpoint of the \'piece count\'. It\'s advertised as 790 pieces and the marketing piece shows wheels and doors assembled in all their splendour and you would assume that a functional wheel, door, or window would be one piece. They\'re not. Each individual part of the functional unit is counted as one piece. Each wheel is actually counted as 3 pieces (rubber, wheel, and axle). In the end 6 wheels are actually counted as 18 pieces. Each window and door is 2 or 3 pieces (1 frame, 1 glass or 2 shudders). When all is said and done, you actually get closer to 400-450 actual functional pieces and most are the one or two brick pieces or decorative single units that fit on one knob of a brick. I\'d love to see 50-75 more \'bricks\' and structure pieces, and less tiny single pieces. So the ""Large Creative Brick"" actually doesn\'t provide as many practical building materials as you might think. It\'s still great to have more LEGOs but the price relative to the actual piece count and the low number of bigger \'building pieces\' was definitely disappointing.\n', '\n  My son is just turning 4 next month and he loves playing with building blocks. So far, he played a lot with Mega Blocks and hence I though it would be a good idea for him to move on to LEGO Blocks. LEGO Classic Large Creative Box is good set to begin with since it comes with around 800 LEGO pieces in 33 different colours and also comes with sturdy nice LEGO shaped storage Box.Large number of LEGO blocks and the huge storage box was main reason to choose this particular set. The storage box is quite large and included 790 LEGO blocks only occupies 1/4 of the storage space in included storage box. So there is lots of room to expand if you buy extra LEGO Bricks, Extra Baseplates or LEGO figures, there is lots of extra room. To give you idea, box is about 14” wide x 9” high.A small booklet with some building ideas is included which is great for beginners like my son who will start building LEGO for the first time. It should be mentioned that there are lot more building ideas on their website along with downloadable PDF instructions.There are lots of different type of pieces included like few base plates, doors, windows, tires, wheel rims etc. I think included base plates are not sufficient if one start building large things or number of items at the same time so I also ordered extra two 10”x10” LEGO baseplates.There are many very small parts so be careful if you have smaller toddlers as it is potentially a chocking hazard. Another thing that should be noted is these blocks are significantly smaller than Mega Blocks so initially small kids may find it hard to find right pieces  and build things out of it and may need some help and parent support. The trick is to separate each colour blocks and put them in separate Zipolac bags so when following book instructions, it’s easier to find pieces.\n', ""\n  I haven't opened it as it is a Christmas present for my granddaughter but, what child doesn't like Lego!\n"", '\n  My boys love this. It brings them hours of safe fun and the item can be used to make all types of toys of all shapes and sizes. They learn excellent maths skills, they have to read in order to follow instructions, and work out how to make bits fit.\n', '\n  Bought as a gift for one of my granchildren\n']"
