The picture quality is great, and the sound is more than I expected. I am still getting used to the stereo quality.  I am very happy with it.Here is an update:  The audio was out of sync with the video.  I looked online to find an answer, but what they had did not apply to this model.  I called customer service and the fix was easy.  Unplug the set, hold the power button down for 40 seconds, then plug it back in.Now sometimes the remote does not work as well, so here is that procedure:Turn off TV, remove the batteries from remote, push all buttons two time, put the batteries back, turn tv on, then hold the home button for 2 seconds.  I don't know who comes up with this stuff, but that is the way to do it.  I hope the web helps you to find this.\n"", ""\n  I bought this for my kids room. At first I was upset upon taking it out the box because when I seen the power cord it reminded me of the power cords for boom boxes back in the 90's. To top that I could not find an insert for that plug. I was so frustrated I started to google where to find the plug in on the tv itself. My husband goes.. Whats wrong.. I said there is no plug in for the cord.. He sits down in front of the tv and I kid you not within 2 seconds he found the dam insert. Super calm n collected.. I had spent 15 minutes slowly looking at every part of the flippin tv. An he just finds it instantly. I was relieved and grateful If he hadn't been home I don't think that tv would be working right now. I would of put it back in the box! Super mad. Lbs. The tv is great. Beautiful picture great sound easy setup. The kids love it. Just note.. The plug in for the power cord is on your left of the tv, nestled in that box area.. The actual insert is inside of that at the top. If your anything like me.. And aren't used to looking that hard for a plug in.. You will be happy to know that ahead of time. üòä\n"", '\n  I purchased my tv in March. It always acted kind of funny & made me reconnect to the WiFi every time I turned the tv back on. However about a month ago, (after only having the television for 2 months) the tv stopped responding to the remote entirely and would not connect to the WiFi at all, as this is a smart tv that means it does absolutely nothing. I went through all of the troubleshooting with BOTH the manufacturer and the seller. I have been trying to get it fixed for almost a entire month now.They sent me a new remote, they have sent me through every single trouble shooting and other step. Amazon told me I just contact the seller (Best Buy) and they tell me They won‚Äôt or can‚Äôt do anything and tell me to contact the manufacturer (Insignia). This product is supposed to have a 1 year manufacture warranty, I also have a 4 year protection plan.I am absolutely regretting ever purchasing this TV.... I have been put on hold and transferred back and forth between these companies who are both refusing any responsibility or decent customer service.\n', '\n  Now, sure.. there will be some oddly enraged people who will find something not perfect with this TV, but what seems to happen is that none of them actually paid any attention to how much they paid.1. There is hardly ever a reason to rate any TV 0/1 stars if you paid $100 for it and it has a 32"" color- (hell, LED!) screen, FireTV, a remote, WiFi, a frame and stand.... I could go on.. but I\'ll stop there. It wouldn\'t even matter if the TV doesn\'t turn on, and you had to return it to get a replacement, still at least 3 stars.2. The TV is actually really nice!. After I switched the display settings to Movie and turned off all the edge enhancement and noise reduction shenanigans, the picture is wonderfully crisp (again.. keeping in mind that I paid $100, and it has only 720P resolution.. as stated in the description).3. I absolutely LOVE the menu and ""live pause"" feature! It\'s way better than my $2K+ Samsung TV. Responsive, better remote, I can pause live TV! (OTA- Digital Antenna- Amazing reception)4. Setup was a breeze, no problems.. zip.. nada.5. It has three HDMI ports (+1 compared to my main TV)6. It has a USB port that can power my amplified OTA Digital Antenna, how convenient is that?7. It has a Optical Audio Out, which perfectly connected to my unused Sony soundbar, yay!.. yes, the out of the box sound, rather expectantly, sucks balls.8. I had no issues at all to cast YouTube from my phone directly to the TV, super smooth, no stuttering or connectivity issues.Yeah.. so I love this TV already, which fits my personality.. as it was F\'N $99 !!! C\'mon man. Ridiculous. The FireTV stick alone costs half as much if I buy it by itself.\n', '\n  This is my review of both the Insignia 32 inch smart Amazon Fire software that comes with theTV . Although I have only had the tv a few days,so far is has a good picture and excellent sound. However if you are think that this tv is going to operate on the internet wirelessly ,probably that ain‚Äôt going to happen because the software and the ability for it to discover wifi is horrible.  I can stream movies any where in my house from my computer. My house has 3 floors. My router is on the top floor. This tells me that any connection issues are not the fault of my router.  Before buying the Insignia I bought a Toshiba smart tv with the same Amazon fire software as the Insignia tv. Both tv‚Äôs were in the same room as the router. At first both tv‚Äôs had the same problems and the same error messages-no internet connection. I returned the Toshiba, at the advice of Toshiba tech support, After reading the reviews on the Toshiba, many of which had the same complaint,  I then bought a Philips Roku tv which worked perfectly but had no browser and no ethernet. Finally I bought the  Insignia; Result: same problem and same advice from Insignia tech support as from Toshiba. ‚ÄúTake it back to the store‚Äù  Of course it took some hours of testing to finally diagnose the real problem. Finally once I hard wired the tv via ethernet it worked perfectlyBottom line: The tv is good so far but the software and tech components used to discover wi fi ,suck. Also do not depend on tech support for real answers. Unless you can connect the tv directly to your router ,DON‚ÄôT BUY A FIRE TV.\n']"

BEWARE!\n', ""\n  Don't feel intimidated about getting this particular television, especially if you're on a budget, and if you haven't upgraded your television in several years. You get what you paid for obviously, but not everyone can afford those UHD 4K OLED offerings - which can cost you thousands depending on the brand.With the TCL 4 Series it's more of an introduction than a straightforward future proof alternative to what's available currently on the market, there's still some caveats to consider if you do end up getting this television, the biggest example being the lack of a HDMI 2.1 port, the viewing angle causing saturation depending on where you're looking, or the fact you have to create a Roku account in order to actually use your television to name just a few.So far though everything has been working as intended despite those few gripes, it arrived in perfect condition without any scratches or noticeable defects thankfully. Now granted if you can afford a slightly better TV, you should obviously go that route more than anything. Just keep an open mind about what you're getting into for the price. You won't get the best experience possible out of 4K at this price evidently - but the whole point is to be an affordable entry. And for what it is, it's the best place to start.\n"", ""\n  Only criticism is every time you turn it on, you have to select the specific port/cable/box you want to use. It should just turn onto HDMI one if that's the main input, just annoying that you have to take extra steps just to watch TV..other than that is of excellent quality.\n"", '\n  I purchased one of these thinking it would be good for my mother with failing eyesight.  The first one had a dead pixel line right down the center.  The replacement worked fine for less than a week, then the antenna receiver quit working (i.e., no signal pickup on any channel).  We tried two other 200+ mile HD antennas from working TVs, but no more signal pickup.I also want to mention that you cannot just use the TV.  You have to register with Roku to activate it, whether you plan to use any of the Smart features or not.  I will say however that registering (I assume) allowed the TV to show a guide for the public station channels, which was a good feature.\n', '\n  This is a bad ass tv, good sound and quality picture. Only complain is that it‚Äôs in my room. The light stays on and can‚Äôt cover it because of the remote sensor.

The picture is sharp and clear. I got a independent stand to attach to it so it would fit on my existing TV stand and it works perfectly. It didn't take me long to set the TV up and to update the apps and services I use to it. It gives you 4 HDMI plugs. The biggest downer for me, is that it doesn't work with just any sound bar, and does not work with blue tooth. You have to actually get a sound bar that specifically works with the Roku TV. Also, everytime you turn the TV on, you are brought to the home screen, instead of the last thing you were watching. These two things are so minor and with the price of this TV, I can't find it to be a reason to mark it down. So if you are looking for a TV on a budget, this is a great choice.

It was in EXCELLENT QUALITY when I received it.  Easily un-boxed and able to set-up.  All items were present. I have to say this was the quickest set-up I\'ve ever had for any type of device (T.V, PC, Laptop, Phone, etc.).  Although I did a bit of research before I purchased this device through Amazon.  Then after I ordered it and while I was waiting for delivery I did a bit of reading on this site (reviews & Q&A\'s) just to have an ""edge"" when it came time to set it up.  When all was said & done it probably was an hour to hour and a half from opening the box to setting back down on the couch after all was done.Once you read through all the Q&A\'s, and about 75% of them are questions that have been asked two to three times, you\'ll have ALL of your questions answered so once your t.v. is delivered you have a plan of action and push right through that set-up.Here are the biggest ""complaints"" that are non-sense when dealing with a ROKU t.v.:A. It doesn\'t COST A PENNY TO SET UP A ROKU ACCOUNT and activate your T.V...if for some reason you come across a site or a phone call demanding payment in order to activate your t.v...hang up or whatnot, and reevaluate (i.e. make sure you have the correct website typed in or the correct phone number dialed in).  You can activate your roku t.v. with a ""free"" roku account.  You don\'t even have to put in a credit card.B.  You get what you pay for...Yes, while that is true in every aspect of life you can get a good deal without having to pay out the butt.  I believe this is one of those times!!C.  This item DOES NOT COME WITH A WALL MOUNT.  If you want to wall mount it you buy the mount yourself.  If you want to specifications of what size wall-mount to buy they are all in the directions that come with the t.v.  While I didn\'t wall mount it (I just used the stands that come with the set) If I wanted to all I had to do was either read through the Q&A\'s (as that question has been asked over 20 times) or just read through the ""directions"" booklet provided with the T.V.D.  If you want to use your phone as your ""roku remote"" all you have to do is d/l the app from your store (G-Play or apple) and you\'re good to go.  No, the roku remote doesn\'t have numbers on it and yes it does have volume control on the side of it. Just remember, both your phone and your T.V. have to both be on the same wi-fi connection in order for your phone to work as the remote, if not, then it\'s a NO-GO!!E.  If you have satellite, cable, etc...YES, it works with this T.V., along with Wi-fi.  The model I have doesn\'t work with Ethernet or bluetooth, but TCL does have models that do work with Bluetooth & ethernet.Be a bit proactive, it\'ll save you a bunch of time in the end!As I stated earlier, it didn\'t take any time at all for me to set this up from beginning to end. Take a bit of time and do some research!!This set is great quality and you are easily able to adjust it to your liking in the settings menu.  Every aspect of this set is adjustable.  I couldn\'t be happier with the amount I paid for it!!!Try it, YOU WON\'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!In the pictures below, one of the pics is the front of the set and the other is a side shot showing the thickness of the set along with the fact that there aren\'t a million plugs coming from the back area.\n', '\n  I first want to say that I read through about an hour of reviews before deciding to purchase this TV. Fully understanding that sometimes you get what you pay for. I\'ve waited almost a week to write this review because I wanted to give myself time to fully evaluate this TV. I give it 5 stars for price and quality. I\'m very happy I took a chance to try a lesser known brand over the bigger names. The things that stand out the most that other people complained about are 1) no volume buttons on the remote. Not true. They are on the side of the remote. 2) having to enter your credit card for the Roku account. Also not true. At the bottom there is an option ""skip this step"" so you do not have to enter any payment information. 3) some people complained about the sound and picture quality. If you go into the settings, you can change all of those things to your liking. There\'s even a ""game mode"". So overall, I\'m extremely happy and I would reccomend this TV to anyone who is looking for a great TV at an even better price.\n', ""\n  The TV is excellent and weighs about 10 lbs.  You have to register it using a code.  I tried doing so with my phone but it didn't work.  So I called a number on the registering app -  Turns out I must have entered the website wrong and then dialed a scam number.  This guy told me I needed to pay $99 to register the TV.  I said not a chance bozo I'll read the manual and send it back If I have to pay anything else with the TV.  I called the number in the manual and the woman said there is no cost to register the TV and that the first number must have been a scam.\n"", '\n  I purchased a TCL 32s301 ROKU tv to use as a multi computer monitor in my office. It was only 720P but I was impressed by the quality of the picture. I do not do much gaming just an occasional flight sim.

The good points about this TV: excellent picture quality, ROKU, WIFI, great customer support from TCL (contacted for general questions and received answers within a couple of hours), thin bezel, 3 HDMI ports, USB port and excellent price for quality and features.The bad: It was not free but compared to what I have paid for dedicated 1080P monitors of less size and quality in the past it was almost free.The bottom line: this is a reasonably priced Tv with great features, great picture and overall good quality.  It is a really good computer monitor.

What should be super easy, setting the TV up, was a mess.  The remote control quality was a joke; pressing buttons would occasionally work as expected... about 50% of the time pressing would elicit no response, or moving 2-3 spaces at a  time.  Makes using the remote tedious at best; entering usernames & passwords are a waste of time.As for the UI, the clumsy Samsung Hub nonsense is equally useless.  They list the apps they want you to use, and you have to search to figure out how to add other apps, such as YouTube TV.  I'm very comfortable with tech but this was just awful.  Coupling this overhead with a garbage remote resulted in a return the same day I bought it.  As a user of samsung products, this makes me want to reconsider.\n"", ""\n  UN40N5200AFXZA has a great picture and sound, if you use a Fire Stick. Without the Fire Stick, there is a sound lag. Tech support techs on Twitter are useless. I tried fixing it with the advanced sound control but it didn't work. Need them to send an OTA fix and they were clueless.I ended up returning the TV.

V to work.\n"", '\n  This tv was a very good investment. When I opened it up I was shocked at how big it actually is. It seems to be bigger than 32 inches. I‚Äôm disabled so I‚Äôm on a limited income so I don‚Äôt have cable or internet. I used my Wi-Fi hotspot on my phone to set it up. You need to set up a  Roku account (which is free) it asks you for credit card information to pay for any channels like HBO or Showtime but I skipped that part because I don‚Äôt want to pay for more stuff. They also want you to download the Roku app, (which is also free) and it shows all the movies and tv shows you can watch for free. There is a ton of them. Then there is a section to set up any devices that you wish to hook up to your tv, like DVD player, game consoles and so on. Then you set up the tv part where it searches for the channels from cable or in my case, the antenna. It found 56 channels on my antenna. That‚Äôs more channels than I previously had. The setup was super easy, the tv is really lightweight, the picture and sound quality is exceptional and the size is perfect. I am very pleased with this purchase and I‚Äôm excited to use it. I just got it today so I haven‚Äôt really had time to explore everything yet. But so far I love it !!\n', '\n  I am a Spectrum cable subscriber, I did my research and decided that this TV would be a great way to reduce my bill . I called Spectrum and was assured by a rep that the Spectrum TV app was supported by ROKU.Reviews stated that Roku did have the Spectrum App in their channel store. this would allow me to return my cable ""boxes"" and subscribe to a much less expensive Spectrum plan.i received the TV, and the set up was super easy, but i cannot find the Spectrum App??  Like anyone, I GOOGLE this to see where it may be hiding, only to discover this;as of DECEMBER 14th, 2020‚ÄúDespite our best efforts to reach an agreement, Roku has not accepted Spectrum‚Äôs offer to continue our contract, which allowed customers to access the Spectrum TV app from Roku devices. This change may prevent new downloads of the Spectrum TV app to your Roku device, but you can still access your full video library by downloading the Spectrum TV app to your Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, Xbox, smartphone or tablet,‚Äù Spectrum wrote in a statement on its website.this disappointment aside, this is a slick little TV for the money.\n', ""\n  For the price, this is a great little TV.  Incredibly easy to set up. Basically a plug 'n play after it searches and finds your WiFi connection! Just click on the installed channels to accept the ones you want. TONS of free stuff & there are others with options to purchase.The only negative things to mention are1. The remote is tiny and the volume/mute buttons are in an awkward spot on the top right side.  It would be more convenient to have them on the front so accidentally hitting the vol/mute buttons didn't happen.2. Sound quality isn't as sharp as it ought to be. The volume can be vastly higher or lower between channels, too. But the muffled tone is there on all of them.  It's not just me, as I also have a similar sized Sony in my living room and the difference is definitely noticeable.  A separately purchased sound bar might help.All things considered, I'm still pleased with my purchase and would more than likely purchase a TCL again.\n"", '\n  I‚Äôve only had it a day and so far voice command doesn‚Äôt work and it logs me out of every app after the tv is turned off. I read other reviews similar but hoped I‚Äôd get lucky but unfortunately this tv is junk as many others have said. My advice is to spend a little more and get something better because this may be cheap but it‚Äôs also poor quality. I will be returning for sure.\n', '\n  Sometimes the remote has to be in an odd spot to respond but so far the os has been fine and tv has worked properly\n', '\n  I wanted a TV to mount at my desk for viewing security cameras, watching YouTube videos, some occasional gaming etc.  My wife confiscated our other 32"" TV for her desk so I had to find a replacement.  Set up was annoying...asking for a lot of information just to get in to the Roku part.  Fortunately you can skip the payment section.  After set up it was smooth sailing.  Logging in to NetFlix, Hulu etc was pretty simple.The picture quality is what you\'d expect from a TV in this price range.  It\'s not our Samsung 8K TV but then again, I wasn\'t buying it for that.  Network interface is strictly WiFi, someone complained about no Ethernet...well...there\'s a pic of the I/O...be more observant.  WiFi these days is sufficient for TV/Media unless you just have really crappy WiFi and refuse to upgrade.  I\'ve hard wired everything in to a patch panel in my home which takes the load of WiFi, ymmv.Uses standard 100mx100m VESA mounting hardware.  If you\'re looking for something you can just watch TV etc on and not expecting a $1000 TV performance this is a good buy.\n', '\n  Bought this for my two girls. I put it in their playroom. I didn‚Äôt like the stand pieces it came with. The picture quality isn‚Äôt my favorite, but this price for a smart tv is a steal. My girls love the access to their favorite streaming apps.\n', '\n  Llego dos d√≠as antes, en buen estado, lo √∫nico que no me gusta es el control pero fuera de eso todo est√° perfecto, tiene buen sonido, buena recepcion, me gust√≥\n', '\n  Buena Televisi√≥n\n']"
