While I don\'t mind the size, I would love if it was a little bigger to make it easier to hold.2. There\'s no place to store the dongle in the mouse. This should be standard for all wireless mice, especially ones marketed for travel like this one.3. The clicks are way too loud. In a room with multiple people working on computers, this mouse is noticeably louder than the others. The sound of the click is comparable to the sound of a blue switch for a mechanical keyboard.4. Connection issues. The Bluetooth mode is borderline unusable, it will work for maybe 10 minutes and then stop working until I re-pair it with my PC (I tested this on multiple devices, it behaved the same way). It will also occasionally feel laggy or jittery using the dongle.5. The scroll wheel is significantly better than other ""fast scrolling"" mice. The ""ratcheting"" feels really clean, and you can customize the force it takes to turn it. There is a big problem with it though, the scroll wheel rattles. It\'s very distracting while using it. I can pick it up and shake it to make it rattle, but even just scrolling, my finger can easily move the wheel from side to side. This ends up just making the wheel feel a little cheap, even if works well.6. The Logitech Option software just isn\'t very good. The slider for the SmartShift sensitivity is backwards. Sliding to the left increases sensitivity and sliding the the right decreases it. The Logitech Flow feature also doesn\'t work very well. Moving the mouse to the second screen and back just doesn\'t feel fluid, it will be very jumpy for a few seconds then return to normal.Overall, this mouse does not live up to expectations. This mouse is too expensive to be having these kinds of problems. I\'ve used a Logitech M310 mouse for years and never run in to any similar issues. Given these issues, this mouse should cost around $30 rather than $80.\n', '\n  I love the MX Anywhere mouse because it\'s just the right size for my hand.  I\'ve owned all the versions of MX Anywhere (original, 2, 2s, and now 3).  This new 3 model is a really nice upgrade and with a larger incremental leap than seen with the prior generational line of MX Anywhere mice.  Compared to the 2s, the 3 is of course slightly lighter, slightly better smoothness over surfaces, and the USB-C charging port means one more device I can charge using modern USB-C cables.However, the thing I most like is how they made the mouse wheel action fully adjustable.  It\'s amazing how I can use the Logitech Options app to customize how ""clicky"" turning the wheel is and how fast I need to spin it before it goes into free motion.  I really appreciate the extra engineering effort and cleverness put into this little device and its tiny motors, just to make my mundane mouse experience a tiny bit better.  Great job, Logitech!\n', ""\n  Was really looking forward to this mouse with the new scroll wheel. Been using the original MX Anywhere for years and it finally started developing the double click, thought I'd upgrade to the newest iteration and will be happy. Thought wrong. The only good thing about this mouse was the scroll wheel. Nothing note worthy otherwise, and worse, it's actually not as good as the last one if you omit the scroll wheel.Up until the MX Anywhere 2S, the overall shape stayed the same, it was a small mouse, but ergonomically it was great for the hand. This one however, they changed the shape. The left side of the mouse where there was a slight protrusion comparing to the right side was perfect for the thumb to place in a very natural position. Now left and right side are exactly the same. They also shrunk the width of the side concaved area where you fingers rest. It's just surprising how much difference that makes.Now the holding gesture feels like you have to squeeze your finger toward the mouse with tension, which basically resulted in pain/discomfort within about half hr of use. I had to switch back to my old mouse.Logitech, please for the love of god, stop changing designs that aren't broken, refresh them, update them, but if it works don't mess with it. Same with the G9x mouse I had for over 7 years. Every new Logitech gaming mouse I've tried feels unnatural and results in discomfort comparing to the G9x. Just bring that same shape back and I will buy it!\n"", ""\n  There are two main things that turned me off and is making me return it and ordering the MX Anywhere 2s older model.  I use the wheel tilt feature to send specific keystrokes when tilting left and tilting right.  I was excited when initially unboxing the new MX3 and really liked the new spin-wheel but when setting it up and realizing the tilt functions were gone blew my mind.  The one other large issue was the Unifying USB dongle being larger, sticking out further from your laptop.  So, two thing that I consider regression but with a ~$30 premium.  I'm going to return the 3 and order a 2s.\n"", ""\n  This is an awesome mouse and I'm glad I purchased it but I must say for how expensive it was I am surprised at how loud the clicking is. While I was waiting for this mouse to ship I bought a $12 Bluetooth mouse to use in the meantime and that one is pretty much silent so I got used to it and was thinking this mouse would be pretty silent as well. Overall, I love the size of this mouse, it's perfect for my smaller hands, but it's not teeny tiny like my other mini Microsoft mice. The scrolling is pretty good and that's basically silent. I just wish the clicks weren't' so loud for when I'm recording videos.\n"", '\n  I’m coming from an MX Master 3 and I really enjoy using this mouse. It’s not perfect but it’s one of the best mouses I’ve used for work. I’m on my computer 10+ hrs a day and the height of the MX Master 3 I found to be too aggressive. This mouse has a much better form factorThe scroll wheel is killer! As a developer scrolling through many lines of code this thing is a life saver. It’s super smooth and whisper quiet.If the MX Master 3 is too large for your hands and find it uncomfortable this is a fantastic alternative. I just wish they made something like this combined with the Model O and a horizontal scroll wheel (and maybe some more buttons)\n', '\n  Not much has really changed on this mouse compared the the MX Anywhere 2 or 2S but the scroll wheel is fantastic.Great control and the wheel feels solid as you can easily scroll that wheel fast and yet it feels like its got great torque and control.  Other than that, tracks better on a dark table or desk than it did for its previous versions.White colour is nice!\n', ""\n  X window third button is moved to scroll wheel press down action -- this is inconvenient, since the position moves when pressing on the wheel.Speaking of the wheel: it does have a different feel, you don't press down to switch between different scrolling speed/type anymore -- instead it switches over with the momentum of the spin, sort of cool. Except now the press-down-action is converted to third button, which is not good at all.If you never had the previous generation, this is the best mouse ever -- works anywhere, always did, using them for a decade.\n"", '\n  I have been a big fan of the MX anywhere versions 1 & 2 for many years.  But version 3 is a big disappointment for me.The left and right clicks are so noisy I am embarrassed to use it with anyone else in the room.  The noise alone is reason for me to return it.It is very lightweight - much lighter than versions 1 or 2.  I do not care for this.  Others may find this a benefit, for example if you are going to carry the mouse with you in a bag.  But I prefer a much slimmer mouse for travel, so the light weight is no help to me at all.The appearance is plasticky, and it looks like a cheap mouse you might find at the drug store checkout.The addition of USB C charging is a welcome addition.It pairs nicely with my existing Unifying receivers.Others rave about the revamped scroll wheel, but I preferred the feel of the wheel in the older versions.Sadly, this will be a return for me.\n', '\n  I bought many Logitech mouses. Everyone I buy I say the last one. They are no good. Battery life sucks, tracking sucks and they do not work properly. This one is new, and so far I am happy. I hope for a long time if not will never buy another Logitech product.\n']"

When I found this product, I needed a new mouse. The old USB connected one I had was getting annoying. The wire was cumbersome, and the scroll wheel was shorting out. When I saw the price, $10 did seem to be a bit of a stretch to me for a mouse, but as I went to comparing it to others, I found out quickly that this was the cheapest product out there with the best reputation. I'll only roll the dice so many times on internet purchases, and this seemed to be a safe bet. I was right. I got the mouse a few days ago, and I've been using it extensively since. It feels wonderful. The design is very comfortable and the rubber/polymer body is very smooth. DPI/sensitivity and page toggle buttons (the buttons on the side move your browser pages forward and backward, they are not for scrolling, as I was led to believe by the description. A pleasant surprise, though) work wonderfully. The buttons are a little more sensitive then I thought they would be, but that's probably because this is a new, quality mouse (something I wasn't used to using). The USB receiver is very low profile, so now worries about it sticking out like an unsightly USB stick (no worries about it accidentally breaking off, either). I have used it for some gaming (nothing in the MMORPG category just yet) and it functions perfectly fine as a gaming mouse, it just doesn't have the custom appearance. My only concerns for it right now are that my extensive use of the wheel button won't damage it for my web browsing purposes. I love this mouse, though, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a replacement wireless mouse, or if you're like me and looking to trade in your old wired one.\n"", ""\n  Loving my new wireless mouse by WisFox!  I'm enjoying it's ergonomic feature, as I have arthritis in my fingers and the ease of use is quite noticeable.  Not bulky and heavy like some of my previous mouses.  I am also enjoying that the arrow isn't jumpy or glitchy, a problem I had with my other wireless mouse by another name brand company.Takes one AA battery (not included) and the receiver is located next to the battery.  After you insert the receiver into your computer USB port, it takes only seconds for it to set up and use.  Love it!  :)  Fast and easy.Comes packaged in a sturdy box, complete with Mouse, receiver and an easy to read User Manual.You won't be disappointed.\n"", '\n  \xa0This mouse works great! I use it for my work laptop and it’s ergonomic and allows for smooth movements  (doesn’t get stuck like some mouses I’ve tried and the pointer is accurate!). It’s a great product and is a great value for the cost. Check out the video I uploaded and see for yourself.\n', '\n  This mouse was pretty easy to set up and feels good in my hand. I love the electric blue color.\n', '\n  This is a very nice mouse. I’m using it to work from home. It’s very comfortable and easy to use. Needs a AA battery. Not included. Shipping was fast. Customer service responded fast and very profesional.\n', '\n  The product was fast shipped to me, came in a very secured box, out of the box to my laptop and start using it One battery only which I liked a lot because you do not need too many batteries to use the mouse. Easy to use easy to plug and play. I would be recommended this product to anyone out there. When you buy this truth me, you will never regret it. I guaranteed you that you would love it or your money back. I gave it 5 stars rating.\n', '\n  First reaction:I liked the simple packaging, for sure… and when the mouse came out, I was pleasantly surprised by the heft of the device. This does not feel like a budget product. Weight is very good. I am a 6\'2"" male with decently large hands. I would have maybe liked something just slightly larger in the palm (I mean slightly), but I see no issue in using this mouse as my daily driver (and intend to for the foreseeable future)Setup was super easy. Basically, plug and play. I’m using Windows 10.. Plugged in the little USB adapter, and it connected immediately. Sensitivity was quite high at first, but one quick adjustment in the windows settings, and it was perfect.I really loved that the battery compartment is secure but super easy to open and close. I frequently struggle with the little doors that cover mouse batteries, but this was super easy to operate (relieved!).Operation is perfectly fine. Buttons are working as expected, same with the scroll wheel. Only tiny complaint I could see someone having about the buttons is that the click is (slightly) louder than what I’m used to with other mice.. So, if that’s something that may be of concern (ie, working late at night next to a sleeping partner or college roommate), you may want to consider something with a softer click :).I have used the mouse for some light gaming (Fortnite) with no issues. I should say that I\'m not a hardcore gamer... if you are someone who needs more than the left-click, right-click, click wheel, and the two buttons on the side (pretty standard), then you may need something more beefy.I have tested using it from about 10 feet away with no issues or drop offs.Only thing I haven’t really been able to test fully after only using it for about 6 hours total would be the battery life. I would be happy to update this review after a few more days of using to see if there are any issues. If I can still use this at moderate daily use after a week or so without having to change the (one) battery, then I would consider this mouse perfect for normal daily use.\n', '\n  I received my mouse on time and very comfortable and right size for use. Great design and the price very affordable. Try this mouse and I recommend it.\n']"

(Plus its beautiful!!!)Well I got it in and was so excited only to be completely let down because the pointer was ""jerky"" on the screen and it was hard to maneuver.... BUT I am absolutely ECSTATIC to report that after a month of using it I FINALLY realized this morning that there are PROTECTOR FILMS ON THE BOTTOM of the mouse!!!! After removing them I am so happy to say that after going through 6 mouses in 3 months I am finally COMPLETELY SATISFIED with this one!!! Moral of my story... DON\'T BE A IDIOT LIKE ME AND REMOVE THE FILM PROTECTORS :)\n', '\n  Being one of the only IT guys in the family and among my group of friends; I often get asked questions on what are good tech products, after all some of these items are usually expensive and no one likes wasting money. With the past holiday season, I helped pick out laptops for nieces and nephews for school, gaming laptops for the friends, a custom made pc, and a slick new Macbook Pro. With all these new systems being bought, everyone’s next question is “What accessories should I purchase??”, I always suggest that anyone buying a laptop at least get a wireless mouse.I have used wireless mice for years; there are great mice, good mice, and downright awful mice. Most of the choices out there on the market are going to be based on what you personally like, what feels good to you, and what functions well.  I do a fair amount of travel for work and I have certain criteria for equipment to make it into my travel bag; after all I will be carrying that equipment around the airport from anywhere between 6-12 hours, so no junk allowed!!For a wireless mouse I look for the following:• Use on any surface laser• Skids that slide well with ease on multiple surfaces• Long term battery life• Small USB receiver• Comfort and size• And above all else PRICEThe VicTsing MM057 checks off all of my criteria and more! On top of having all the features I require from above it also has:• six (6) buttons, two of which are custom programmable which means you can make them do whatever you’d like!!• On the Fly Adjustable DPI – this means you can adjust the sensitivity whenever you’d like, which is great if you like to play video games, this feature can come in handy.• 2.4GHz wireless with a 15-foot reach, so you can easily use this for a media center pc while sitting comfortably on the sofa.VicTsing got it right with the MM057, it is super comfortable in the hand, it’s large enough to provide good support to help prevent hand fatigue, and groves for your thumb and ring and pinky fingers (sorry lefties this is right handed only), it has a really soft rubber coating, smooth gliding action, and an ultra crisp scrolling wheel and button clicks. I tested the MM057 on PC and Mac, it was plug and play on both, which means you will be using your new mouse in seconds. I like to carry my laptop around with me throughout the day and the MM057 worked on every surface I put it on which allowed me to be truly mobile and move about how I wanted without having to carry around a mouse pad and worry about a flat surface, the MM057 will work on your jeans just fine if you are so inclined.Another major plus is using a single AA battery as the power source, not only are these more common to find around the office/home than AAA but in my experience the AA tend to last longer in mice and you only need one versus the two you would usually need for AAA. There is convenient storage for the Micro USB receiver on the bottom of the mouse, so if you choose to unplug the receiver there is a safe place to store it so it does not get lost. The adaptor is a great size, it is slim-line enough to leave plugged in all the time, even when you need to carry your laptop around in your bag or briefcase without fear of it breaking off.This is one of my favorite mice; I give it 5 out of 5 because it deserves it. It is a great mouse for a great price. I recommend them to friends and family, and VicTsing stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty. Buy with confidence, great product, great price, and fast shipping.\n', ""\n  I'm a gamer, and this was meant more for my girlfriend who does simple browsing and maybe typing some documents.For me, this would definitely not be enough, but I would obviously go for something more involved - like a mouse with 500 buttons and serves me Mountain Dew and orders pizza for me.But if you're like my absolutely terrifying girlfriend, and you do basic things on your pc or mac, this definitely works and it's cheap. No problems after over a year of ownership.Oh, if you have hands the size of Donald Trump's, you may enjoy it more. People of the large-handed sort are going to find it uncomfortable. It's pretty compact.\n"", ""\n  I've purchased no less than a dozen wireless mice over the years and nothing else comes close to this one.ERGONOMICS/COMFORT: I'm a man with medium sized hands and it is difficult to find a mouse that isn't too large or too small. Fortunately for me this mouse fits PERFECTLY in my hand, allowing me to easily rest my ring and pinky fingers on it. In terms of ergonomics it is one of the most comfortable mice I've ever used, be it wired or not.DESIGN/BUILD: The scroll wheel isn't loud and has a nice texture to it. It's also very responsive, which is hard to find in a lower budget mouse. The left side buttons are positioned in a good spot so that I don't have to make an effort to use either of them. There is a DPI button located in the top center of the mouse. Often these buttons can be hit on accident during regular use—especially when operating the mouse wheel— but it is low enough that it is never a problem.The top of the mouse has a smooth, plastic matte finish on the that helps prevents the hand from getting hot or sweaty. The thumb grip is covered by a textured rubber material that feels nice quite nice to the touch. The right side of the mouse, where the ring and pinky fingers rest, is a normal plastic.The mouse itself does feel a little heavier than your average wireless mouse, but I think that is a positive thing. Very light mice feel cheap. Most of the weight is centered around the palm where the battery is placed.BATTERY LIFE: I purchased this mouse back in February and I've only had to change the battery once, or twice at most. It is honestly so few that I can't remember using a mouse that had such longevity. What's especially surprising about this fact is there is no On/Off button. It simply turns itself off after being idle for a short while and immediately turns itself back on when you press a button.EASE OF USE/SETUP: Stick the receiver into your computer, press a button on the mouse, and you're done. It's that simple. The receiver is also extremely good and I never lose tracking.DURABILITY: I easily used this mouse for roughly 1500 hours since I bought it. It isn't uncommon for my wireless mice to literally fall apart in the span of a year or two. Typically the side or bottom panels start to come off and anything that is glued to it, especially rubber components, begin to peel away. Not ONE part of the surface level components failed me in that time.However, the left mouse began to double click at random after a year. I consider myself a power user when it comes to computers and mice. In the time it takes an average person to reach 1000 hours I do it in a fraction of the time. Despite the failure in the left mouse I still instantly purchased a new one when the problems arose. Why? Because for the price, performance, and quality this was a minor inconvenience. I've had numerous $60+ wired mice have double click problems that weren't half as good as this one.CONCLUSION: The combination of the price, build quality, battery life, ergonomics, and functionality makes this the best wireless mouse I've ever used. Period. In fact I'd put it in the top 3 best all around, with ease. Even with the left mouse failure after a year/~1500 hours of use I can't help but give this mouse a five star review. If, however, it was a more expensive mouse ($30+) I would knock off at least one star.\n"", ""\n  its really good with everyday usage , the range is really good , and it connects really easily . however i noticed if you move the mouse VERRRY VERRRY slowly then sometimes the cursor doesn't move which is annoying when you try to edit photos or crop something , this also means your'e not going to be as accurate if you play games like CS:GO. its really unnoticeable but other than that it's almost perfect.\n"", '\n  Waste of money. Doesnt feel comfortable, and louder than loud....\n', '\n  Good Design, I use it for work, worth the price! Cheers!\n', '\n  This mouse is very comfortable and easy to grab because of its perfect size.Its supports AA battery and WIFI is 2.4GHz, so uninterrupted range and connectivity.Its perfect for everyone because it has an inbuilt feature of adjustable CPI so we can change the sensitivity and cursor movement.value for money deal must buy if you are looking for a wireless optical mouse.give it a try.👍\n', ""\n  Product is as described. Feels really good to hold. The thumb contours are really well designed and have a soft rubber material. Overall, I'm happy woth the product.What could have been better?1. On/off switch - It's turns on when you press any button and turns off after certain time of inactivity. Probelm is when you keep it in a laptob bag/case, it might turn on due to unintended pressure.2. The back/forward keys could have been customizable for other functions.\n""]"

The top is soft touch material, and the buttons have very quiet click sounds. I also like that the mouse goes to sleep when not in use, and you need to click to wake it. That way accidental table bumps or cats jumping on your desk won't wake your PC.About the only thing I was disappointed in was the wheel. Being a ball, I thought it freely rotated in all directions for side scrolling. It's actually just a wheel for vertical scrolling, though it works just fine. I won't take a star away because it's such a bargain, but be aware it's not actually a ball!====UPDATE====It's been almost a year, and the mouse still performs as it should.

Was very happy with it initially after I adjusted the dpi settings.  I use the mouse all day for work and frankly, it's not cut out for that level of usage. It's already degrading in key performance categories as follows:1) Scroll wheel started stuttering and is no longer useable.2) Batteries wear out quickly.  Not a big deal walking to my battery charger and popping in a new AA but doing this every couple days is a bit much.3) Mouse cursor become intermittently unresponsive but when I take it off my mousepad, it works much more consistently.Hardly worth going through the trouble of returning it for less than $11 but I am now in the market for a better mouse.  My foray into wireless has been thwarted.** update 1/27/18 **The vendor sent me a new unit and I've had a much improved experience.  I believe the original unit was defective.  Notes:- Use a good battery.  The rechargeable AA batteries I've been using are old and don't hold a charge as well as they did.  A new battery resolved a lot of the twitchy cursor issues- The scroll wheel has held up well considering my high volume daily usage- I really like the size of the unit and the wired Gigabyte m6800 I went back to for a while seemed clunky in comparison- I can recommend this wireless mouse now and if you're one of the rare users like myself who gets one that's faulty, get a free replacement\n"", '\n  UPDATE (2/14/12) By reading my original review of the VicTsing mouse you can tell that I was immensely upset with the purchase. HOWEVER - the VicTsing customer service I upon hearing my displeasure immediately reached out by email apologized for my inconvenience and offered to send me the newer version of this mouse (free of charge incl. shipping) I accepted the offer but wasnt expecting the replacement to be much of an improvement.  A few days later the mouse arrived - and my first impression upon open opening the box was that they\'d sent me a much more exspensive mouse to somehow compensate me - the styling, construction, (and upon reading the manual) features all were vastly improved.  I connected it to my computer and saw that the problems. with the prior mouse were  addressed and that in fact every operation and in  every nuance the mouse was greatly improved. I\'ve been using it for a week now and although I can\'t vouch for how well it will ""hold up"" I believe I will be pleasantly surprised.In summation - I was thoroughly impressed with the company reaction and the replacement they\'d sent, however after recieving it I did think they\'d sent me a more expensive model, imagine my surprise then when I saw that on the Amazon website this new mouse is LESS EXPENSIVE than the original one!I know - people will say ""setttle down, it\'s only a mouse, and a cheap one at that ""  Maybe so, it is ""only a mouse"" - but it is a DARN good mouse and it IS a ""CHEAP"" one at that!Ive only had this mouse for 4 or 5 months - I don\'t usually leave reviews of items purchased (15 years - over 200 items) as usually I\'m petty satisfied.  But with this mouse I feel taken and conned.  Even though it seemed to have descent features it has flaws which at first don\'t seem to be insurmountable as time goes by grow increasingly frustrating.  The two biggest are - the 5 setting D.P.I.function which controls cursor sensitivity does not remember the level it is adjusted to between computer shutdowns. Upon restart the mouse has to be reset each time. And the other aggravation is with the scroll wheel - while upward turns of the wheel are rendered properly (most of the time) the Downward scrolling of the wheel.is sporadic at best.  And the wheel also records sporadic middle clicks.  Again, these problems while in themselves arent devastating as time goes by these two ""difficulties"".combined  other minor items make the decision to purchase this mouse a bad one.  I understand that this mouse is considered a ""bargain mouse"" but I\'ve had plenty of experience with other mice in this category and at higher levels and expected more especially considering other reviews.  It didn\'t cost much and know I know why.\n', '\n  This is a great mouse from a technical perspective. Took a chance ordering an unfamiliar brand and (it\'s only been 3 days) so far, so good.  I have a large-ish female hand and the curve of this mouse is significantly easier on my hand than my previous smaller Logitech. I haven\'t explored all the options yet - there appear to be a plethora - but I do know that after popping in a battery and plugging in the wireless USB, I was using this mouse on my Windows 10 laptop within 60 seconds.I\'m deducting one star because of delayed reaction time when first logging on: I unlock Windows and move my mouse and... HELLO, where\'s my pointer?!? I get nothing for about 2-3 seconds. I have to jiggle and click the mouse to ""wake it up"" and find my pointer on my screen. Maybe there\'s a fix for this and I haven\'t had time to find it, but I don\'t remember having this problem before. It\'s a wee bit frustrating, but I can live with it for now.  The true test will be longevity: I can never seem to get more than 6 months out of a wireless mouse (with anywhere from 2-10 hours of use a day during the week) before it dies.  If this one lasts longer, I\'d probably buy again (if that delayed response thing doesn\'t end up driving me nuts).\n', ""\n  This is a supplement to my earlier review concerning my original mouse which was only usable for right handers.  The Company was extremely responsive to my comment, and offered to send a replacement ambidextrous version without knowing I'd already ordered one (no left handed version apparently exists).  I've had the mouse about a week, and it's excellent.  It's light, responsive and ergonomic (understanding it's ambidextrous).  I especially like the fact that it goes to sleep fairly quickly to conserve power, though you need to know to push the small black button on the top to bring it back to life.  I particularly like that the USB plug stores in the mouse itself, like higher priced mice (mouses?).  You can't beat this mouse for the price.  I also highly recommend this seller for their responsiveness.\n"", '\n  bought it specifically to be a bluetooth mouse for my android tablet.instructions followed but no bluetooth so,basically,a complete waste of money\n']"

It is a good mouse with long battery life and an off switch, but looses points because they fail after 9 months of daily use.Size: 4 StarsThe mouse is a bit longer than most, but smaller than many of the 'ergonomic' mice. It fits my larger hands comfortably which many smaller mice don't. My wife has smaller hands and finds it comfortable to use. I have several young children and they have no problems with it either. the mouse is pleasantly symmetrical, and while nice to look at and fit in smaller pockets, my hand is not symmetrical. I have a thumb on one side and a pinky on the other. I would say like most people, but I haven't met most people. this leaves your ring finger kind of hanging and your pinky to rest on whatever surface you are using the mouse on. If you were to pull your pinky into the thumb groove, it would cramp. You may think this symmetry makes it good for lefties, and while my wrong handed sister says it is the most comfortable right handed mouse she has ever used, the extra forward and back thumb buttons are on the other side, making them awkward to operate for a leftie who has to use her ring finger. Something she assures me she could get used to, but in order to she'd have to get her own dang mouse and stop stealing mine.Connection and Laser: 5 StarsThe mouse connects to a nano receiver that connects to any USB port. It is NOT Bluetooth (this is good, it doesn't have paring issues like Bluetooth). The connection is good and the movement smooth. Other wireless mice suffer from an issue where they go into standby after a few seconds and don't catch the initial movement when you start using the mouse again. Not this one. This mouse will track on any surface I have used it on and moves smoothly. I have used as many as 5 of them in the same room at the same time with no ill effects or 'cross talk'. I have read that there is a way to connect a mouse to a different nano receiver, but I have not tried or messed with this and have also heard that posting a legal notice on your Facebook wall will protect your copyright and privacy rights, so who knows just don't lose the tiny receiver, there is a storage space for it in the battery compartment. Also, don't store it in the battery compartment and forget you put it there and tear your house apart looking for it. Finally, the optic is invisible so no red light or blinding death laser shoots out the bottom.Durability: 3 StarsI am not easy on my mice. Neither are my children. I have a work laptop and a personal laptop. Both have their own mouse (different colors thank you Logitech). My work one gets used 50 hours a week or so but only on a desk and rarely gets dropped. My work mouse tends to last 9 months before buttons start double clicking. My personal mouse gets used less, but still several hours a week and it is used on every surface in the house, couch, bed, dog, desk, wood grain table, pant leg, child's diapered bottom, carpet, wall, glass stove top (while stove top is off), tile wall, leg without pants, wife's back, bottom of shoe (ineffective, yes), and on rare occasion, a mouse pad. My personal mouse is dropped, thrown, used as a shield defending from a wife slap, drooled on, and occasionally kicked. When not in use it sits in a bag that gets thrown around with regularity. This one usually lasts 7-8 months before buttons stop clicking (or double clicking) or the laser stops reading as many surfaces. My media center has a mouse that is used very sparingly, a few minutes each day starting or ending a show. When a previous mouse did 7 months with me and the laser started getting picky with surfaces, we moved it to the low use media center mouse. This mouse has lasted in this position for more than a year without getting any worse. So I firmly believe that this is an over use/abuse issue. It is worth noting that I have owned and used other mice from Microsoft and HP and Dell, and none of them lasted so long.Battery Life: 5 StarsThe mouse takes 2 AA batteries (and puts them facing the same direction ick) and they last a while. the cavity is large enough to accommodate slightly larger rechargeable batteries of you use them. My 2 mice are turned off when not in use but experience heavy use and the included Duracell batteries last generally longer than the mice. My wife's mouse sits on all the time and gets moderate to heavy use and her batteries last more than 6 months. There is a nice little strip of plastic built in that when you pull on it, the batteries pop up, this is a nice extra feature for changing batteries so you don't have to jam a butter knife in there to get them out, then slip and rake your finger with the jagged edge and pathetically explain to your wife how you managed to cut yourself with a butter knife and watch as she hides the scissors.Weird light on top: 3 StarsThere is a weird light on top. It turns on when you turn the mouse on, reassuring you that the mouse is, in fact, on. This saves you from the gut wrenching anxiety of wondering if the batteries are dead every time you turn it on, only the batteries last forever... The light turns off after a couple of seconds to not waste battery power. It's nice, but not necessary. Also, I think I remember it flashing angry red at me after it got thrown across the room one time, so this may be the mouse's primary method of communication and who am I to silence it.Noise: 5 StarsThe mouse is whisper quiet. I am usually unable to tell if it is on or not by sound alone. There is a light and satisfying click sound when clicking either button or turning the switch on and off. Usually whatever I am using for a surface for the mouse makes far more noise than the mouse itself.Off Switch: 5 StarsIt works. there is a small ridge in the middle offering enough friction to easily turn the switch on or off and there is a colored pad under the switch so you can see a bit of red when off and green when on. This is useful because the words for on and off are etched on and can only be seen if you catch the light just right.\n"", '\n  This review is for the returning M510 users out there. If you\'ve owned this mouse, you should know that that Logitech has changed the design a little bit. Along with their new logo, the new ""2nd Edition"" M510 (missed opportunity by not calling it M510S or something) now also sports a ""laser-grade"" optical sensor, as opposed to the old ""actual laser"" sensor. After doing a deep dive for some information, the internet scholars on a couple first-page forums have confirmed a few facts for me. First, the optical sensor is not necessarily a downgrade. Laser sensors have inherent issues - some complaints on the old 510 were that it exhibited cursor stutters, jitters, and shakes - and the modified design is likely to address those concerns. That being said, laser sensors have higher a DPI resolution, which should mean that they are more precise. Conventional wisdom might make you hesitant to purchase this new M510S (my nickname for it). Why would the \'newer\' model have LESS DPI\'s? What an outrage!Well, let\'s be true millennials and talk about how it feels. The optical sensor feels smooth and rounded, yet agile and lively. It\'s actually really enjoyable. The cursor ""acceleration"" on the older version became more pronounced while using them side by side, and it started to get annoying after I actually noticed it. Without subtle wiggles, the overall experience is more precise.Fortunately, the folks at Logitech seem to be pragmatists and have figured that, while they took away some of the super-awesome DPI\'s, the mouse actually performs more satisfactorily during real-world use. After doing way more research that I bargained for, I found out that most people would agree too.I wish the change was more clearly communicated, though. I almost didn\'t even open the packaging because I thought it was counterfeit, so my first time using it was littered with skepticism. I wrote this review because I don\'t think I\'ll be the last person to go through that.If you currently own or have owned the 1st version M510 and want to replace it or get a second one but are now reluctant because it\'s a different design, just buy it. That\'s the beauty about this thing: a mouse is not something worth obsessing over, and it just works well.\n', ""\n  This is the second time I've had this mouse. The reason for my 1 star is because it is the second time the scroll wheel has stopped. It is intermittent on when it works. I'm a gamer and use the scroll wheel quite often. Do you know how annoying it is to have to literally PRESS DOWN to even get a response from the scroll wheel? I even used compressed air to clean out the inside of my mouse, hoping that the scroll wheel would work again. Nope. Nothing worked. I used my mouse like it was my own very little baby. But, regardless of how gentle I was with it, I hate that stupid scroll wheel.I will not be buying a 3rd Logitech M510 mouse, ever. I actually went ahead and bought another brand. Thanks Logitech for losing a loyal customer. I gave you two tries, I can't afford to give you a 3rd.\n"", '\n  This is to replace the first one I got and I loved it so much I got another when, after a year of hard use, it started doing a double click when it was pushed once.  I don\'t care because it was a great ""normal"" mouse with all of the bells and whistles while not trying to be something different.UPDATE: I loved this mouse BUT: I ordered my first one in August of \'16. It started to do double clicks, deleting thing I didn\'t want deleted. I ordered another one September of \'17. Now it\'s February of \'18 and my second one is doing the same thing. New batteries don\'t help. I ordered a different brand this time.\n', '\n  Logitech nailed it again. I had a previous model of this mouse and I was happy to find that the current model even more comfortable.Forward and backward button are much more convenient to control.The tiny USB stick sits neatly and tightly on the side of my laptop.The medium size of the mouse is just perfect for my hand.The on/off switch on the bottom of the mouse is an asset.The installation is a breeze..If my review was helpful at all, please click the ""Helpful"" smiley button below.\n', ""\n  Logitech M510 BLUE - Either Logitech have gone downhill or this item was faulty, though the seller won't accept that. The scroll does it's own thing- ie continues to scroll on it's own. The select button (left click) doesn't allow you to do anything other than click - you can't copy and paste via this button nor can you rotate objects in games as it just wanders off and does it's own thing.  The receiver can't connect unless extremely close.  Overall it's totally useless and very frustrating to use. On the plus side it feels nice in the hand and looks very attractive, BUT I need a mouse that works not an ornament. AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS.\n"", ""\n  A very responsive wireless mouse that I use for 3D related programs and software (e.g Autodesk Maya, Mari, Zbrush etc). While I like using it and haven't encountered any problems, I take a few issues to it.1. The middle mouse button is harder to press, and that can be a bit of a downfall especially for those who rely on it heavily when using 3D related programs. It isn't a huge drawback though, and I get by with it just fine. Just note that it is a bit on the stiff side, and if you absolutely need an easily clickable middle mouse button, this might not be the best option2. This mouse is rather heavy, and that's primarily because it requires two  AA batteries to keep it going to make up for the non-wired connection. Obviously, all that extra weight affects the ergonomics and general usage. It's not a lightweight by any means, but once again, not a big deal for most. It was just a noticeable difference from my old mouse, which was much lighter by comparison.3. From what I can tell, the DPI is set. You can change the cursor speed, rendering it less sensitive or more sensitive depending on your settings, but you can't actually change the DPI itself.at the moment, these were the only drawbacks I noticed right off the bat. I have yet to change my review the longer I use it, but for now, it's a pretty good mouse for the price. It's responsive, has really satisfying buttons which are apparently all customizable (I have yet to look into that), and it has a nice ergonomic shape with rubber sidings. It also has really nice rubber feet which could prove to be useful for various surfaces.Final Verdict: It's an ergonomic friendly mouse with extra customizable buttons that are really satisfying to click. Good for long usage and for those who use 3D related programs or general use. However, it's heavy, has a stiff middle mouse button and has no option to change the DPI. Regarding the battery life, only time with tell after using this mouse longer.4/5\n"", ""\n  I kept it as a spare, but won't use it unless emergency if other breaks down. I dislike the feel of handling it as I've quite small hands and i could tell fairly swiftly my fingers would hurt from stretching to keep clicking , that's why i got a clunky brick type ergonomic sideways type instead which is perfect.\n"", '\n  Based on 2 weeks of use.. I like it. Its a decent size and works great comparing to my old Logitech. I love the programmable buttons and I really missed my back/forward ones on my old. feels more expensive than it was. Connected straight away and no issues with cursor lag so far.Time will tell as my previous Logitech failed after 1 year of use.\n']"

However, with less than two months use, the mouse starts to show problem. The problem is that the mouse sometimes cause some random movement of the pointer, making it hard to select or click things. I have tried to change the materials under the mouse, like white paper or directly use it on the surface of the desk, and the problem continues.Update, I changed the battery and it works well again! I guess the issue is caused by low battery. Five star!!\n', '\n  I bought this for our smart tv and at first it worked fine but then it would glitch and not move on the tv even though we were loving it on the table. We replaced the battery thinking it was that and it still happened. I would not recommend buying this.\n']"
