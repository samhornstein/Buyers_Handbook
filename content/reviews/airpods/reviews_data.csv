This is misleading and inaccurate.  Is the improvement drastic, no, but it is still an improvement.  The improvement is that Apple has upgraded the on-board chip to the H1, which leads to faster and more stable pairing.  This isn‚Äôt anecdotal.  It‚Äôs been tested and proven to be faster.Also, if you opt for wireless charging, buy the case with the gen 2 AirPods and you‚Äôll save a few dollars.If you already have the 1st gen, then it‚Äôs probably not worth the upgrade.  If you are looking to buy your first pair of AirPods, then go for these.\n', '\n  These AirPods are amazing they automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out. A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say ""Hey Siri"" to activate your favorite personal assistant. Plus, when you\'re on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency.Additionally, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge, and they\'re made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time. Just 15 minutes in the case gives you three hours of listening to time or up to two hours of talk time.I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy\n', '\n  These are great but not much better then gen1. Only addition is Siri feature. I will rather buy the previous model on discount and Save some green.\n', '\n  Excellent, pretty useful... easy to use and reliable.

Seamless connection, great sound quality, compact and high quality design you always receive from apple.However, I was very nervous to buy on Amazon.

In the product description it did state the second generation model number  MV7N2AM/A and with amazon's amazing return policy I decided that it was the risk to buy and if the 1st generation did show up, I could easily return and purchase somewhere else. Thankfully, after checking serial numbers on both the box and after the airpods were connected through my phone I can confirm these are authentic, second generation airpods.  Based off others reviews that they received generation 1 airpods, I can't 100% guarantee you will get 2nd generation airpods, buit it seems like they've stopped sending out the old pairs at this point.\n"", '\n  Look at the box.

Only one version.Let\'s go through the differences1. Physical Appearance:Shorter Stem, but larger bud or headThere\'s a large black airflow grillA mic inside and outside the AirpodsCase is same thickness, a lot wider, but shorter. Still uses lighting cable to charge, but it does come with a lighting to USB-C cable2. In-ear, instead of on-earIf your ear has a small cavum and the original airpods fit perfectly, then the Airpads Pro may be a tight fit/more uncomfortable, but seeing the in-ear design, the ear piece will go into the ear canal and the rest will float in place.Those with normal or larger cavum it\'ll fit well.Some may not like the ear piece going into their ear canalThese ear phones are more for a closed environment than an open oneSeeing that it\'s an in-ear design, you may feel this hollow air effect going on unless you turn on transparency mode (more on this later) or play music with active noise cancelling onSeeing that it\'s in-ear, it has a tighter grip, better for joggers, those who shake their head around a lot for some reason, or if you run up stairs often. If you have an intense workout regimen and/or do extreme sports and not mindful it still can fall outThere\'s a Ear Tip Fit Test on app. There\'s several ear tips in box. When you turn on this feature in app it\'ll calibrate and suggest what ear tips are best listening experience for youIf you lose the tips or get them dirty overtime, you can go to the Apple store and get replacement pair for around $4 or get cheaper 3rd party ones when they come out3.

Battery lifeBattery life varies depending on how far away you are from the device and volume you set. Battery depreciation over time. These are just rough estimatesPro in general has 4.5 listening time with active noise cancelling or transparency on. Airpods version 2 has 5 hours. Note Airpod version 2 does not have active noise cancelling or transparency mode.  You can get 5 hours with noise cancelling and transparency off, but most likely you\'re not going to unless you\'re really desperate for batteryPro has 3.5 talk time. Airpods have 3 hoursCase both old 24 hours battery lifePro: 5 mins in case = 1 hour talk or listen time. Airpods 15min in case = 3 hours listen, 2 hours talk5.  Water/sweat resistantNow you can go to the gym and do cardio with them on.As mentioned before, tighter grip seeing that it\'s in-earMay survive light rain. Do not recommended going in the shower or dunk in the pool with it though 6. Active noise cancellation, Transparency modeAirpods pro has 3 modes: Active noise cancellation, off and Transparency modeActive nose cancellation tries to block out outside noise while listening to music. I\'d say it drowns out may 70%. If you focus to outside or aren\'t focused to music; you still may be able to pick out what\'s going on, but in general it does it\'s job.Off is just like the standard in-ear headphones, but with the hollow air sound when no music is playingTransparency mode. The black airflow grills let in outside sound so you\'re able to hear both outside sound and music same time. Think of it as open ear headsets.Unlike some in-ear headsets the black airflow grills prevent you from hearing yourself in your head when you talk7. Sound QualityBetter than the previous version seeing the active noise cancelling and in-ear with more focused sound direcly into your ear canal. It\'s not $250 audiophile quality sound.  Better quality sound in lows and mids compared to non-pro version. If you ever tried the Power Beats Pro, it sound very similar to thoseYou can hear callers better in a noisy environment and less likely raise your voice--Conclusion:Other than that, all other features are the same. Meant to be used on Apple devices. Very good ease of use for Apple users, and is in-style these days (shows social status). Sound quality is better that the non-PRO version, and you do get noise cancellation. There are other headphones that do it better sound in this price range, but may not be as convenient with pairing to Apple devices.\n', '\n  With the new transparency mode, I can listen to music knowing that I will never be ran over by a car on the street again.

Airpods Pro has a new anti-sweat function, so you don't have to worry about sweat damaging the headphones during exercise. Noise reduction function can isolate external sounds, so you can enjoy music at the same time2. Battery life. I tested the battery box for about 16 hours, and the headset has less than 5 hours. The noise reduction function may consume more power.3. It's not suitable for sleeping. When you wake up, you may find headphones everywhere. In addition, when the power is off, the beep is very annoying. It is recommended that friends who want to sleep use sleep earplugs.4, I found that the low-frequency sound quality will be more impactful and fuller than Airpods 2, but the overall sound quality is not much different from Airpods2Old review:I give this product 4 stars. I got this product before Black Friday and have been using it for 10 days. Here is my experience using headphonesAppearance: 3 stars1.The surface feel is the same as the previous two generations, and it is easy to scratch. It is recommended to buy a third-party protective case or a charging case with a protective case.2.Portability personally feels better than the previous two generations, because the appearance is flatter and the earstems are shorter3. There are three sizes of earbuds. The default is medium size. The little ears are still a bit painful after wearing them for a long time. Changing the trumpet is much better. The silicone sleeve is not easy to remove and replace. In addition, the silicone of the earphones is a bit smelly.4. Uneven gaps are found in the charging case. I don't think there should be any problems with the workmanship of the product at this price, so the appearance is only 3 stars.Comfort: 4 stars1. In-ear AirPods Pro is not as comfortable as non-in-ear AirPods.2. At present, it has been about 40 hours with earphones. It is said that there are stomata to regulate air pressure, so there will be no pressure in the ear for a long time. Ear pressure balance is better than Bose3. AirPods Pro will have better air tightness to the ears. Sony WH1000XM3 will have some air leakage, but Sony WH1000XM3 is a headphone. Among in-ear active noise cancelling headphones, AirPods Pro may be the smallest and integrated The highest degree and the most complete function4, running without worrying about falling, squat without worrying about pressing the neck. Its presence is much stronger than AirPods. You ca n‚Äôt expect to wear it for a long time like AirPods before. You will forget its existence. In fact, it will always support your ears to remind you of its existence. One advantage is that compared to AirPods, AirPods Pro is stronger and harder to drop. For sports-loving users, AirPods Pro will be more suitable for you.5 stars1. Active noise reduction is the biggest difference between Pro and AirPods 2. AirPods Pro has three noise reduction modes, namely noise reduction on, off, and transparent mode. The official said that Apple ‚Äôs innovation in transparent mode, but I see other brands (Samsung, Sony) The headset also has a similar function.2, AirPods Pro's noise reduction is not as good as Sony WH1000XM3 on-ear noise reduction headphones, but it is the best among real wireless headphones. As for how to achieve such an obvious noise reduction effect in such a small volume, I don't understand. The intuitive feeling is that the noise reduction effect is obvious.3, I can feel quite quiet on the road, so it is strongly recommended to use noise reduction off or transparent mode on the road.Sound quality 4 starsThe AirPods Pro's sound quality has not been significantly improved compared to the previous generation of AirPodsSummary: This is an excellent headset. If you value the noise reduction function more, it is suitable for you. But if you are more concerned about the sound quality and have no need for noise reduction, I suggest you buy AirPods 2, because AirPods 2 is cheaper. In addition, the charging box and headphones must not be lost, the official charging box and headphones accessories are expensive\n"", ""\n  It isn't fake Airpods Pro. In case if you are worried, just go to checkcoverage.apple.com and check your serial number of Airpods pro outside your box / inside Airpods pro. Amazon will refund your money in case they have sent you the fake airpods.In regards to Airpods pro, it is great value. There are tons of NC earbuds out there, but airpods pro is one of the best one in the market currently. I personally owned QC 30, Bose QC Earbuds, Sony WF-1000XM3, but airpods pro is the best among them. Bose QC Earbuds have better sound and better battery, but it is twice as big as airpods pro. Sony WF-1000XM3 has better NC, but it has terrible connection issue.So while Airpods pro may not have the best NC, Battery, or Sound quality,  it is best all arounds. Solid NC, Solid SQ, Awesome connection and integration with other Apple devices, Spatial dynamic audio, small charging case, Good call quality and so on. It is a best-buy.The only issue that you might have is, some people - including myself - seem to have issue with the size of ear tips. Apple gives you S,M,L sizes of ear tips along with airpods pro, but unfortunately, none of them fits my ear perfectly. They either fall or feels very unease. This is why I took out a star from overall quality. Nonetheless, it is best out there and if you own Iphone, I don't see a reason for not buying this.\n"", '\n  First of all, I purchased this directly from Amazon. Look out for ""Shipped & Sold by Amazon"" - and you are guaranteed to receive a legitimate product. Other reviewers who are claiming that the product is counterfeit are probably purchasing from third party sellers.Let\'s get to the review.I am someone who does not enjoy the ""in-ear"" style earbuds. The ones with rubber tips that you jam into your ear canals. They are usually uncomfortable and give me headaches. For this reason, I have stuck with the traditional EarPods and AirPods design.Taking the jump to purchase AirPods Pro wasn\'t easy. It goes against all my beliefs and preferences for earphones. However, I must applaud Apple - because this is now my main listening device (previously an AirPods 2nd gen user). I learned that in-ear style buds cause me pain because of the build-up of pressure in the ear canal. The AirPods Pro have vents that regulate the pressure inside your ear, making it feel almost like the regular AirPods - invisible. If anything, I can wear these for hours until the battery dies, whereas the regular AirPods hurt after maybe an hour or so.Transparency mode and noise cancellation mode are easily switchable by holding the AirPods stem. I usually keep mine on Transparency mode, but it is nice to switch to noise cancellation mode for when my environment is too loud. FYI, the AirPods Pro come with different ear tips, so you will likely find one that will create the most optimal seal in your ear canal.As of writing this review, I purchased this on sale under $300 CAD. The fact that Apple makes their products work so well with each other is another reason that this is a good buy. If you have an iPhone/iPad, AppleTV, or MacBook, you can switch between devices so seamlessly - without re-pairing the AirPods each time.

Upon receiving the earbuds, they actually have a much more square profile which I think provides a unique and arguably better look.Audio: I tried these earbuds out on everything from Drum and Bass, Ragtime, Classical, and Rock genres. I found that the audio across the entire spectrum was very enjoyable, and provided much more bass than expected when the genre demanded more. I do a decent amount of Dubstep and R&B listening, and was pleasantly impressed with the low-end delivery. This didn't take away from the mids and highs at all. I couldn't find any standout weak area across the spectrum.The headphones fit snugly in my ears, and while providing great audio quality, allow for ambient noise around you to filter through. While working, I was able to still able to slightly hear my keyboard typing in the background. I would not, however, recommend these for any sweat-inducing activities.Features: The touch controls on the earbuds are surprisingly simple and intuitive with a little practice. Start/stop, volume, skip forward/backward, and call controls are all present with simple touch controls. Call quality was crisp through the earbuds, and on multiple test calls the other individual couldn't tell I was using bluetooth earbuds for the call. I have not tested these in a windy or noisy environment, so I can't speak to the performance in that arena, though the product does make claims for noise-cancelling mics and seems to be well-positioned to address any background noise.The ability to use these as a pair or individually is a great addition as well. When paired to your device in the binaural setting, taking one earbud out of your ear immediately pauses your content until you place it back in your ear. They can also be set-up for single-ear usage as well, though this isn't a use case I personally need.Comfort: I've worn these for 3+ hour stretches and effectively have forgotten I'm using them. They are extremely lightweight and the battery has thus far performed at or past stated specifications. They fit well in the ear and have done everything claimed and more.I'm absolutely surprised at the quality of the product and would recommend these if you're looking for something you can use over the course of the day, in the office, around the house, etc.\n"", ""\n  UPDATE 2/23/21: I removed the Noise Canceling info below as these ARE NOT noise canceling and the title/description of the item has been changed by the manufacturer to reflect a clearer statement. I have given this the star back as it is doing everything it claims to do and very well.I've had these buds for about a week and here is my current review. I will return and update the review if I run into anything not mentioned below. I want to preface this with I am mostly an in-ear or cans wearer of headphones when it comes to listening to music, etc.* Sound - Good for the price. With a little EQ tweaking they sound even better. I recommend you do the same.* Battery life - Is as advertised give or take a few minutes. Charging is quick as well.* Fit - This is tricky with me. My ears are VERY hard to get a good fit with any in-ears/buds. I can get a pretty good fit with these without the fear of them falling out during workouts/outdoor activities.* Comfort - I've worn these all day with no pain or discomfort. I do need to remove them every hour or so to wipe them off as my ears get a little sweaty, but zero pressure or pain while using them for extended periods of time.* Controls - No physical buttons and the controls are pretty straight forward for this type of headphone. Single tap, single tap and hold, double tap, triple tap, etc. I have accidentally activated an input while seating them, but is expected with this type of design.* Call quality - These really shine here. People think I am on my phone and not wireless buds even when in windy conditions. I use these for Zoom/Bluejeans calls from my laptop mostly and have had zero issues.* Etc. - You can use one at a time. I do this for podcasts while I'm working or on the phone. Music pauses when removed and continues when placed back in. The charging case is small. Like small enough to fit in your jeans coin/key pocket with no issues. USB-C charging port is a plus too. Pairing is as simple as opening the case and holding the pair button on the case till you see the LED flashing. Finally, no annoying flashing LED on the buds when using them.Overall I would recommend these at this price point. The sound quality after a slight tweak is pretty good. I wouldn't recommend these if you are dependent on noise cancelling. I would look elsewhere for that feature. Other than only being available in white, like the fruity brand, I can't find any serious faults with these buds/in-ears.\n"", ""\n  Great sound and great call quality. I use wireless earbuds almost all day everyday. I work in a variety of settings. Sometimes I am alone or using machinery that requires some hearing protection and I have a pair that provides some noise isolation, this pair doesn't do that. The annoyance in the past has been when I am in the office or around others, my other pair is too noise isolating for that environment, making it difficult to hear what is happening around me. This pair is great for that! I love how they don't completely seal off my ear canal and I can hear ambient noise and conversation around me. However the area where these really shine is call quality! On my other pair I routinely have people asking what I said or complaining about all the ambient noise they are hearing, but I haven't had a single complaint with this pair over multiple calls! Highly recommend these if you are looking for a non-noise isolating pair that provides good call quality. As far as battery life, I don't know how long it lasts, just that I haven't run into it yet even with several hours of use.\n""]"
