I’m a mostly tennis shoes kind of girl I’d say you can fit 16 pairs on this, look at my picture. Also I read reviews about the bars being too thick to put the cloth over, I have literally no idea what those people were talking about because the bars I got fit right through. Also read a couple reviews about missing screws, I actually received two extra. There is a small piece of paper that comes with this product that has picture directions but honestly if you have common sense you don’t need it. Honestly if you get the screws all the way in this thing is very sturdy. I feel like most of the bad reviews came from people that didn’t know how to put this together correctly. This thing is definitely worth the money and made so much more room available in my closet. I have absolutely zero complaints.\n', ""\n  I really liked it, fits a lot of shoes and makes ny closet look so much more organized. Also you can't beat the price and same day delivery\n"", '\n  Easy to put together. I like the fabric shelves. Still very sturdy.\n', ""\n  My shoe sizes are between 13-14 (depending on brand). Able to fit 3 shoes per rack so if you're under size 12 you could probably fit 4 shoes per rack. Materials feel sturdy enough to last and it was super easy to set up (less than 10 mins). So yeah I'm pretty happy with this shoe rack. Everyone with tamale feet like me know the struggle when trying to fix shoes racks that actually works with our big shoes 😂\n"", ""\n  The rack only took about 20 minutes to put together. All I needed was a screw driver but I could do it by myself and it was not a huge hassle. I was worried that it might be really cheap and it would wobble and be off balance but it stands straight and balanced! It fits all my shoes (about 15 pairs) and there is a little space underneath where I put my slippers and flip flops. I also really like the mesh racks so that my heels don't fall through. Overall, would recommend!\n"", '\n  Best bang for your buck!! Did have a slight dent but not enough for it to not work. Also, very easy to assemble.\n', ""\n  It looks like a pretty okay product but it became useless as soon as I got to the last step. Which I hated! Because I wasted my time assembling and doing all the steps before finding out that it will just not work at all. So the problem I had is that the rods for the tiers won't align at all with the stand. No matter how I stretched the fabric and all the parts just to align them, it just won't do it. So the screws won't go in and nothing can be connected. Idk if it's a user error, because it doesn't seem to be an issue for most... Or maybe I'm just really unlucky to get a defective piece. Makes me really sad and disappointed. Oh well.\n"", '\n  I am happy with the shoe rack. Fits 12 pairs of shoes, the fabric prevents shoes falling thru and it looks nice too. There is room under the bottom shelf for more shoes. Takes a little time to assemble, but its not hard to figure out. Its pretty sturdy. I am gonna buy again. Hopes this helps.\n', ""\n  Please be aware that shelves are actually fabric, as vaguely indicated in the product specifications. This is not mentioned in the main product description, so I missed this fact altogether. No only that, but the fact that the fabric straps are hold by the flimsy metal bars, this makes it for a very uncomfortable process of assembly. Worse part, if the shoes are heavy, the fabric shelves will sag. The only reason I kept it is because I needed extra storage in a basement closet, so it's out of sight.\n"", '\n  It’s a shoe rack. I gave 5 stars because of the two extra screws included. I’m used to a missing piece, so that was nice to see\n', '\n  Not a bad shoe rack for the price but there were a couple of things I was disappointed by. Firstly, the shoe rack is a dark brown colour and not black, which was hard to tell from the images. Secondly, the shelving components are a piece of cloth, so when I was trying to put my heels on the shoe rack they kept falling because it wasn’t very sturdy.Overall, not a bad shoe rack for the price, but If you have heels, I would suggest getting something else.\n', '\n  I love this shoe rack.  Great for people with big feet your shoes will fit all the way on it and not keep falling off. Lots of room.My cat also loves to lay on the top tier.\n', '\n  This purchase was made to have a shoe stand that needed to fit into an existing space. The height is perfect and there is just enough side space for accessories.  I thought the depth might be an issue but all of our shoes fit comfortably. Tall boots will not fit but I was not expecting them to. Assembly was easy and the instruction sheet was not even required but nice too have as  a reference. It even came with 2 extra screws.\n']"

I knew right away the packaging was much smaller than the original one. The design is different it has hinges in the middle (old design has an ""x"" to make it study) and is not stackable with my original shoe rack.  Its slightly smaller than my original one too. The design is much more simpler and easier to build but i still like the original better. The price for the newer designs is a two dollar more.

I wanted the original rack and now i cant stack my racks up. This is my first bad review. Im disappointed\n', ""\n  I wanted a unit with wire mesh, not rollers/slats, and some space off the floor.  I wasn't sure about stacking another as I was concerned about stability and in a minor way, how it would appear in a hallway. The 3 shelf unit is inconspicuous so I've decided to order another but not to stack.  The instructions were small and rather faint but it would not be difficult to intuitively assemble.  I'm functionally blind, need electronic magnifiers to read, and still managed to assemble this item.  The screw-in legs are obvious, the X frame screws into the end pieces that have 4 holes, and that's it.  The other assembly pieces are the screw-in pins if you want to stack the units and 4 plastic plugs to fill in the holes on the top of the end pieces if you don't stack.  If a blind man can do this, well..........\n"", '\n  I ordered this and was very pleased with the product. I am 75 years old and figured out how to put it together. lol It looks great and is much sturdier than the one it replaced. Liked it so well I just ordered another one today. Definitely worth the money.\n', ""\n  Unless you have very tiny feet, this rack doesn't hold a lot of shoes. It literally can hold 2 1/2 pairs on each level, so no more than 7 pairs total of my hubby's sneakers (with one shoe on one level and it's mate on another). My fault for not reading the specs. I went by the picture of 9 pairs of shoes with room to spare. I don't feel like going through the trouble of disassembling and returning it so I'll just keep it for now.\n"", ""\n  I am really satisfied with this product. I needed a show rack to go inside my closet, and it really is perfect for that purpose. It isn't the most beautiful shoerack one could imagine, but it is also so subtle looking, that i dont mind that. I used to have one made out of plastic and metal rods, and it was so flimsy. This one seems very durable and easy to pick up and move.The only thing you should be aware of, is that you can obviously not put any higher shoes such as boots on the lower tiers. But overall, this one is a really good buy.\n"", '\n  So easy to assemble, very sturdy and fits my shoes perfect. Definitely recommend 10/10. Couldn’t be happier with my purchase, wish I had done it sooner!\n', '\n  It would be really great if it was just maybe an inch wider to squeeze in larger shoes since I do wear size 4D wide. Also it would be an advantage of the lines on the shelves went in to out instead of left to right. The reason being is that certain boat shoes or casual type boots that have a hiking boot type sole, it gets caught trying to pull them out. Be innovative in your thinking and it would be really nice. Overall I like it.\n', ""\n  While this unit is exactly as described, and is sturdy enough, (I only have one, haven't stacked them, as is possible), it is a good value.  My only issue with this piece, and it's kind of a big one, is the photo shows three pairs of shoes on a level.  While this may be possible if you wear a size 5 shoe, or use it for children's shoes, I'm pretty sure the average adult is only going to fit two pairs on a shelf, suddenly it basically loses a third of it's pictured capacity.\n"", ""\n  I don't know why I'm surprised/relieved this product lived up to all the positive ratings, but it's great! Got 2 sets to stack and well, see the before and after photos. I put them together myself on my kitchen counter while my son and husband watched - was so easy and satisfying to assemble because ALL screws and parts were included - even had 1 extra screw per set. Sturdy too - just when you stack them, there's nothing holding the racks together so you have to hold where they join, but not an issue (unless you forget and the racks have shoes on them). Because I was dealing with men's shoes, I didn't need to use 2 of the racks in order to accommodate boots so now I have 2 extra racks, screws and feet - I'd really like to purchase a set of the side brackets and have asked the seller if this is something they offer. Otherwise I will be purchasing 2 more of these shoe racks for me. Oh and came super quick having the next day option.\n"", '\n  Perfect for the bottom of the coat closet. Holds 9 pairs of shoes.

This shoe shelf fits about 9 shoes + 3 slippers or flat shoes comfortably.

It also shipped very fast I was very impressed.\n', ""\n  All except one of the four feet screwed into the bottom, but one of the holes for the last foot was drilled at a slant so the foot wouldn't screw in properly and the whole thing couldn't stand up.

Let me preface to say, I married a first generation Asian-American. When we first started dating, I was blissfully unaware of the horror I caused by wearing my shoes into my now husbands family home. I was very curtly scolded, and told myself I wasn’t going to go out with that guy anymore. Anyways, anecdotes aside, fast-forward to now and we’re  happily married, but shoe storage is a bigger deal than I thought possible.  We bought cheap storage solutions while in our post-grad home before buying and knowing whatever we had wouldn’t be an investment. He grabbed some at Walmart and I got these. For three years, every time he would grab shoes for me, he would always mention how it wasn’t fair I had the better storage unit. My shoes are visible from every height, the shelves are level so my shoes never slip off, and best of all, they fit in between. I have tall heels and booties and I’ve had no problems fitting them on the racks. I do put my higher shoes in the top shelf so I don’t have to worry about height, but they fit on the lower levels too.\n', '\n  I really love these racks! I bought 2 for my husband and they fit between 16-18 pairs! We have them next to each other, but they are also stackable which we love. Such an easy, affordable way to make our closet and his shoe area look neater. Definitely reccomend and will purchase more!\n', ""\n  Really nice product and can be stackable. It fits 9 shoes easily and maybe some flats or slides underneath. Easy to assemble. You'll just need a screw driver to make it sturdier to screwin the screws.. Its small enough to fit in a small coat closet or multiple in a long walk-in closet. I will be buying 3 more to go into my walk-in closet. Really love the dark espresso color. It also comes with floor protectors that screw in from the bottom. Really glad I got it as I have a huge show collection. It has an old vintage feel or you can pair it in a more modern home.\n"", '\n  Just purchased another one of these to put in the closet of our new house! These are compact and sturdy. In the small rental house, I had one shelf out in the room at the foot of the bed, between bed and chair, as the closet was filled with a dresser. They are attractive enough to leave out in the room, but hell on toes in the middle of the night! So, in the new house, they go into the closet. They stack solidly or work fine side-by-side. And they are surprisingly spacious! I have stored approx 21 pairs of shoes here by turning each pair on their side and toe facing heel, much as they come in their shoebox, but without the tissue wrapping or box. Assembly was straightforward and took only a few minutes and no tools. The dark metal looks up to date and modern.  And I store slippers and flip flops under the bottom shelf for even more shoe access and storage! Love it!\n', ""\n  Now that I have it put together, it's fine. However, it was a pain to put together by myself! The instructions are terrible!! They show you positioning it on it's side to insert the little pieces that hold it together. Which would require an extra set of hands to assist. I finally ignored the instructions and was able to construct it without too much trouble. I have another shoe rack, similar, that I bought at Ross a long time ago, it was super simple to snap together and has lasted me for almost 20 yrs, it's still fine, I just needed an additional shoe rack. So it's a good shoe rack, just don't follow the instructions!!!!! ;)\n"", '\n  I purchased 2 of these shoe racks to stack.  They were very easy to assemble and are quite sturdy because of the X brace in the back.  I have them stacked but did not add the top shelf due to space in our closet.  This does not affect how sturdy the unit is in any way.  The shelves are easy to move, and most of the stability comes from the brace in the back, which I really appreciate.  So I have 5 shelves total.  The unit easily holds 3 pairs of my husbands shoes per shelf (boots, athletic shoes, dress shoes).  I fit 4 pairs of my heels side by side as well as a pair of flip flops on one shelf.  I also like that this unit does not have a shelf sitting directly on the floor.  This gives a bit more space for shoes and is easy to clean under without moving the entire unit.  I also like that the shelves are flat rather than slanted to keep shoes neat and not worry about them slipping.  The shelves are made of wire mesh that is nice and sturdy - other shoe racks have just a couple of bars for a shelf, which I do not find helpful for storing heels.  This is a great unit and I would definitely purchase more for other closet reorganization projects in the future.\n', '\n  For girlfriend & she loves them! (her review). Sturdy product. I bought 7 to replace others from a store that were more expensive & made of wood & metal. I do wish the space between the shelves was about 2 inches more as I had to take out the middle shelves to put ankle boots & higher heels, therefore, purchasing more shelves. Very easy to put together (5 minutes). Customer Service is stellar. I had a damaged side & they replaced the shelf! I stacked 4 shelves against a wall, which no balance issues.\n', ""\n  LOVE THIS. I bought 2 of them to stack and they're so perfect. I love how easy it is to remove/add the shelves to customize the rack to your needs. (I have a lot of knee-high boots, which fit perfectly once I removed one of the shelves.) Also, the shoe rack I had before had poles instead of shelves, so my stilettos would keep falling off. Not with this rack though! It's really easy to assemble, too. It probably took me 5 minutes to put together one. The frame is pretty light but sturdy enough to hold a lot of shoes. Definitely highly recommended!\n"", '\n  You pay a few dollars more and get a metal one as opposed to a cloth one.  I bought my 2nd rack only a day later.I love it!!!!\n', '\n  This utility/shoe rack arrived on time and was so easy to put together. Done on a snap. It was exactly what we needed for an entry closet and I will be purchasing two more for other spaces. Why have shoes sitting on the floor haphazardly when they can sit on this rack and be perfectly tidy?\n', '\n  Product worked as described. Nice shoe rack. Not meant for boots as the spacing between shelf are too shallow.  I had some damaged pieces. The supplier was quick to sent replacement parts. I would order again\n', '\n  Love this only dislike it’s not very tall between shelves if you have taller boots they don’t fit very well even if they’re folded down.\n', '\n  Good for 9 pair of men’s shoes.

They all line up nicely & make my room look larger than when I just had one plastic rack!

I may make cushions for the seating area, but I haven't yet decided.  I think they look pretty good as is.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase!\n"", '\n  Very sturdy and beautiful item. Took me less than 15 minutes to assemble. No problems with assembly. Found instructions to be adequate, and everything on my unit was aligned.It\'s lovely, does not overpower the area, and serves it purpose.We have had several men over 200lbs sit on it to put on their shoes (not simultaneously, obviously), and it does not creak or shake. We do have to keep it an inch or two from the wall to give people enough ""landing space"" for their posteriors.Very pleased with this purchase.As a bonus for me, it exactly matches an umbrella stand I purchased elsewhere.\n', '\n  When I started to put this together I noticed that none of the holes lined up with the pre-drilled screw holes.  That makes the whole bench weak and unable to support the weight advertised.  However I must admitted after seeing this on the first brace I was putting together I stopped and checked the rest.  They were all thesame so I didn’t go any further in the assembly and packed it up ready to ship back to Amazon.\n', ""\n  Purchased for my bathroom, and as others suggested, we added glue to the joints to increase it's sturdiness.The instructions were easy to follow (pictures) however it states the tools required for assembly include a flat (slotted) head and Phillips (posilock/star) head screwdriver, despite the included hardware being in allen wrench format only.  An allen wrench wasn't included, so have one ready.  I believe it was 4mm in size.We plan on adding a coat of exterior polyurethane to increase the effectiveness of the existing finish and to stay mold-free in a wet environment.Edit: added table top epoxy and shields the water well.  Time will tell but I'm certain the epoxy stiffened things up even further so should last a while.\n"", '\n  Unfortunately, the quality control on the screws is lacking. And since the since the screws hold it together the overall product review was negative. There was a time when you always got one or two extra screws just in case Something went wrong on your end, but when it goes wrong on their end and they don’t send you extras, I question the product Quality. The design is good, The style caught my eye. it does what it supposed to do I shouldn’t have to go to my tool crib To find a screw to finish the job I paid money for this and it’s not just principle.\n', '\n  Having read other reviews and now own:Can confirm that some screw holes were misaligned. Each leg has 6 holes—2 pairs of screw holes and a pair of bolt holes.My workaround was to loosely install the legs to the shelves by adding a screw into the most centered hole of the side-by-side pair of screw holes (that’s one screw per leg per shelve). The assembly will be wobbly and that’s OK.Next I added the Leg assembly to the seat by loosely attaching all 8 bolts and then stood the whole thing upright on a hard, flat floor before tightening everything. It should be pretty sturdy at that point.I added the last 4 screws to the misaligned holes last. The wood is very soft so the only issue one might have is over-tightening and stripping the the wood—which is really easy to do.The finished piece looks nice. Smells like wood and it’s quite light. I was able to fit 3 pairs of shoes on each shelf, but people with big feet or bulky footwear with not have the same ability.This functions for me. Definitely great for kids or as part of a decor accent. Sitting on it seemed fine, but I’m not sure how they rated it’s sturdiness to be in the 300 lb area unless it’s centered, unmoving weight. I would not recommend a 300lb man sit on this thing.I’m happy with it, but for the quality, it’s definitely something that should really be in the $30 range.\n', ""\n  Buying things on the internet is always a gamble, you have no idea of the quality until it arrives. I can happily say this item is exactly what it should be. It may even seem better, because we as consumers have been conditioned to accept poorer and poorer quality items. The bamboo has a nice finish on it, there were no cracks anywhere and it doesn't feel brittle (the way cheap/untreated bamboo items do). Assembly was easy with one person, if you are furniture assembly inclined (takes some balancing, and you will need to wait to tighten everything). Everything lined up perfectly, and it stands flat with no rocking. It easily holds 200 lbs (no creaking) but I haven't tested anything more than that. It has really helped clean up our small tiled entryway.\n"", ""\n  This is a juggling-weight little bench.

It's not flimsy, but it's not terribly strong.  It'll hold shoes or the like, sure, and a reasonably lightweight adult can sit on it without being overly careful.We've been using ours as a garden bench.  We added an extra layer of polyurethane to the lower legs and put it right on the ground, unprotected outdoors, and it's been a few months of sun and rain.  It's unchanged from its new condition, so it's at least fairly weather-resistant.  For the money, it's very nice.\n"", '\n  Pièce arriver endommagé...\n']"

The instructions are easy and straight forward.\n', ""\n  Easy to assemble, plenty of room for shoes, it's just not very aesthetically pleasing lol but very functional. Overall am pleased because my boyfriend has more shoes than I do and this shoe rack helps me keep some of his shoes organized.\n"", '\n  Covers the bases. Would be great if they could add some washers to keep the screws from stripping the paint. Does the job though. I have them in my closet underneath my clothes. Top rack forces the shoes to touch the bottom of my clothes, so it could be a little shorter. Boots dont really fit but you can make em fit.I wear a size 11 shoe. At most I can fit three pairs of shoes in the side by side config and squeeze a pair of chucks stacked on top of each other on the end of each level. So the real max is 16 pairs of shoes for me.\n', '\n  Assembly was more of a bear than you\'d think - the lightweight pieces snap together easily, but then you have to slide rods into the fabric ""shelves"" and that\'s oddly difficult, then stretching the fabric between the sides is also hard because it\'s a very tight fit. Had to use some real strength to pull them into shape while tightening screws. Now that it\'s together, however, it looks great, works well, seems sturdy and workable. Dimensions appear to be about spot-on too.\n', ""\n  Decent shoe rack for the price. Not fancy looking or anything but looks decent enough. It's not as sturdy as I would think but it's holding up well. The material wipes clean easily. This is being used to hold children's winter boots. I like that you have to option of using different heights for each rack.\n"", '\n  I’m glad I got this, it is a great shoe rack that holds twelve pairs of shoes/boots easily with space for four more underneath. My only issue was that one of the fabric shelves was just a tad not wide enough for easy assembly. Did finally get it together, but it was a struggle. Would probably be trivial with two people working on it. Still recommend it.\n', '\n  I purchased this to organize my hallway closet and it was $20 well spent. I have a small condo and lots of shoes and this really helped organize my shoes and shoe boxes. I have enough space to put more boxes underneath the bottom shelf and it isn’t too high to get in the way of my jackets that are hanging. It’s not the sturdiest but this doesn’t bother me at all as it does what I wanted it to do.\n', '\n  Love these shoeracks!! I got 2 and assembled them with the top rack one position down from where their picture shows because it works better for tall boots. Sturdy and attractive!\n', '\n  I was kind of leary ordering this, but am very pleased with it.  It is strong and sturdy enough to hold adult shoes and boots and clean up my back door area!\n']"

Felt wobbly until the back criss cross pegs were screwed in, but now it seems sturdy as can be. Can hold even more than the 12 pairs of shoes I have on here depending on the width of your shoes. However, the ""bronze"" color is more like black, but it doesn\'t matter because it\'s in my closet anyway. Definitely recommend!\n', '\n  I loved my shoes rack so much i went to my previous purchases on amazon and reordered it. It just came in and im disappointed! I knew right away the packaging was much smaller than the original one. The design is different it has hinges in the middle (old design has an ""x"" to make it study) and is not stackable with my original shoe rack.  Its slightly smaller than my original one too. The design is much more simpler and easier to build but i still like the original better. The price for the newer designs is a two dollar more. Thats not a big deal but why change the design on the original page? Why not just add this new design on a New page for people to give the right reviews for the right product. Im sooo disappointed. I wanted the original rack and now i cant stack my racks up. This is my first bad review. Im disappointed\n', ""\n  I wanted a unit with wire mesh, not rollers/slats, and some space off the floor.  I wasn't sure about stacking another as I was concerned about stability and in a minor way, how it would appear in a hallway. The 3 shelf unit is inconspicuous so I've decided to order another but not to stack.  The instructions were small and rather faint but it would not be difficult to intuitively assemble.  I'm functionally blind, need electronic magnifiers to read, and still managed to assemble this item.  The screw-in legs are obvious, the X frame screws into the end pieces that have 4 holes, and that's it.  The other assembly pieces are the screw-in pins if you want to stack the units and 4 plastic plugs to fill in the holes on the top of the end pieces if you don't stack.  If a blind man can do this, well..........\n"", '\n  I ordered this and was very pleased with the product. I am 75 years old and figured out how to put it together. lol It looks great and is much sturdier than the one it replaced. Liked it so well I just ordered another one today. Definitely worth the money.\n', ""\n  Unless you have very tiny feet, this rack doesn't hold a lot of shoes. It literally can hold 2 1/2 pairs on each level, so no more than 7 pairs total of my hubby's sneakers (with one shoe on one level and it's mate on another). My fault for not reading the specs. I went by the picture of 9 pairs of shoes with room to spare. I don't feel like going through the trouble of disassembling and returning it so I'll just keep it for now.\n"", ""\n  I am really satisfied with this product. I needed a show rack to go inside my closet, and it really is perfect for that purpose. It isn't the most beautiful shoerack one could imagine, but it is also so subtle looking, that i dont mind that. I used to have one made out of plastic and metal rods, and it was so flimsy. This one seems very durable and easy to pick up and move.The only thing you should be aware of, is that you can obviously not put any higher shoes such as boots on the lower tiers. But overall, this one is a really good buy.\n"", '\n  So easy to assemble, very sturdy and fits my shoes perfect. Definitely recommend 10/10. Couldn’t be happier with my purchase, wish I had done it sooner!\n', '\n  It would be really great if it was just maybe an inch wider to squeeze in larger shoes since I do wear size 4D wide. Also it would be an advantage of the lines on the shelves went in to out instead of left to right. The reason being is that certain boat shoes or casual type boots that have a hiking boot type sole, it gets caught trying to pull them out. Be innovative in your thinking and it would be really nice. Overall I like it.\n', ""\n  While this unit is exactly as described, and is sturdy enough, (I only have one, haven't stacked them, as is possible), it is a good value.  My only issue with this piece, and it's kind of a big one, is the photo shows three pairs of shoes on a level.  While this may be possible if you wear a size 5 shoe, or use it for children's shoes, I'm pretty sure the average adult is only going to fit two pairs on a shelf, suddenly it basically loses a third of it's pictured capacity.\n"", ""\n  I don't know why I'm surprised/relieved this product lived up to all the positive ratings, but it's great! Got 2 sets to stack and well, see the before and after photos. I put them together myself on my kitchen counter while my son and husband watched - was so easy and satisfying to assemble because ALL screws and parts were included - even had 1 extra screw per set. Sturdy too - just when you stack them, there's nothing holding the racks together so you have to hold where they join, but not an issue (unless you forget and the racks have shoes on them). Because I was dealing with men's shoes, I didn't need to use 2 of the racks in order to accommodate boots so now I have 2 extra racks, screws and feet - I'd really like to purchase a set of the side brackets and have asked the seller if this is something they offer. Otherwise I will be purchasing 2 more of these shoe racks for me. Oh and came super quick having the next day option.\n"", '\n  Perfect for the bottom of the coat closet. Holds 9 pairs of shoes. It’s plenty sturdy. Easy to assemble (screws take either phillips or flat head screwdriver). I’m really happy with this rack and it’s so nice to finally have my shoes organized!\n', '\n  I really enjoyed how easy it is to assemble. This shoe shelf fits about 9 shoes + 3 slippers or flat shoes comfortably. It was a nice quick project to do it doesn’t take too much time; I would say 25-45mins depending on how savvy you are with building stuff. You might even take less time if you are good at building things because there aren’t too many parts.It’s really sturdy and really nice quality for the price paid. It also shipped very fast I was very impressed.\n', ""\n  All except one of the four feet screwed into the bottom, but one of the holes for the last foot was drilled at a slant so the foot wouldn't screw in properly and the whole thing couldn't stand up. Will be returning.\n""]"

It was easy to put together and is very sturdy. It fits all the shoes in my family of 4!\n', '\n  My wife ordered this and it arrived in a tiny box with tons of pieces. After one glance in the box I instantly decided I was not going to attempt to put it together. Our 10 year old grandson spent the night and wanted a model toy to put together. I made him a deal, knowing he would never make it, that I would buy him the model if he could put this together. Well he proved me wrong and got it done. He probably spent a total of 2 hours working on it with a little trial and error but it is together. He did get his model and is at home working on it. Final answer : Challenging for adults simple for 10 year olds.\n', ""\n  In trying to keep my shoes clean and in decent shape, I've kept them in the original boxes, but over the years this has created a haphazard mess in my closet. I actually enjoyed putting this organizer together while having a glass of wine and listening to podcast on a Sunday afternoon at home (it was like a giant puzzle). Easy to assemble, fit perfectly in my closet and was exactly what I needed for my shoes. Very happy with it.\n"", '\n  Unfortunately there were way too many things wrong with this.When assembling the bottom portion it wasn’t level, no matter what you did to adjust it.The items could’ve been labeled better and the instructions aren’t that great.The metal bars that connect have rough edges, while yes they provide gloves for you to wear while assembling, the bars are a hazard in general and lets face it, I think we’ve all purchased items with metal pieces that didn’t run us the risk of cutting a finger open. Absolutely unsafe.The biggest issue I had was when attempting to assemble the other tiers. The cloth “shelves” would fall apart at the seams when you tried assembling the middle bar, rendering the entire unit useless. The cot for my dog has the same technology where you connect rods with fabric and it supports 100lbs (clearly made by a different company). My point is, this is a cheap piece of garbage. I sent it back for a refund.\n', '\n  Usually, I\'m not the type to leave a review, but I hope my review saves someone out there from the trouble I just went through because this product is just way too horrible. First, the instructions were horrendous, but I could\'ve dealt with that and used common sense and a picture of the finished product to build it. However, when 24 CRUCIAL PIECES ARE MISSING, it\'s pretty impossible to build something. According to the instructions, I was supposed to receive 24 ""A"" connectors. I received ZERO. Still, I tried to persevere and build the item with a couple of extra ""B"" connectors that were inexplicably included, but there weren\'t enough of those either. Finally, after 2 hours of trying to make it work with what I had because I hate returning things, I had to give up, take apart what I\'d already built, and throw in the towel. I\'m returning this. BUYER BEWARE. I\'d read a couple of other reviews that mentioned missing pieces, but I ignored them because I really wanted this shoe shelf. It looked as if it may have been decent had all the pieces been included, but you\'re running the risk that the pieces you need won\'t be included.\n', '\n  Love the concept, takes a little time to build....we were missing some parts so it had to build it shorter by 1...didn’t want to deal with the whole return deal...other than that it’s pretty good!\n', ""\n  The instructions were easy to follow, and it was generally easy to assemble. Not sure what issues other reviewers had with either of these things, but maybe it's been corrected as I experienced zero problems (assembled alone in about 45-50 minutes).All pieces for assembly were accounted for, including the extras.I experienced no quality issues with any materials. Everything held up and fit together well.Fully assembled, it's level, quite sturdy and still very lightweight.I bought the 8 tier rack, and it will hold exactly 26 pair of adult shoes.- My shoes are womens 7, husband is mens 10. 2 pair per shelf. If you are using for narrow sandals or pumps, you might get more. I have winter boots and such on ours.- Not sure what the pouches on the ends will be used for as they are small/narrow, but certainly not shoes.The little mallet was a nice touch, and made it easy to get the pieces assembled tightly.I didn't find the edges of the metal pieces to be particularly sharp and didn't use the gloves, although I thought those were a nice touch as well, since I suppose if you try real hard you could cut yourself.All in all, I'm happy with the purchase.\n"", ""\n  I purchased this to keep all of the shoes (family of 5) out of my foyer. It was a little difficult to put together, as the directions skipped some steps, but luckily this wasn't my first rodeo putting things together, so I was able to figure it out. It's not crazy sturdy, but there won't be a lot of movement as it literally just holds shoes. We have put it in our front closet, so it is out of the way, but could totally be put out in the open too. I am very happy with this purchase!\n"", '\n  The shelves they give you are waterproof fabric lightly sealed with glue (I think) & started separating as soon as I started assembling. I stopped & took 10 minutes to run a seam along glued areas. This solved problem & was very easy to finish. Instructions are pictures but luckily I am very visual so I had no problems. Many reviews I read indicated assembly was frustrating, which I did not find. It did take me approx 45 minutes to assemble. I am very happy with how sturdy it is for the price I paid & how many shoes can fit on it.\n', '\n  It is not sturdy, a pain to assembly\n']"
