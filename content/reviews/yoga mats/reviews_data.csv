I am a regular exerciser and have gone through tons of mats. This one is definitely thicker than most, and also longer than most! That’s a plus because I’m 5ft9 and I sometimes feel like mats are way too short for me when laying down to do sit-ups or stretches. Unlike other reviewers, my mat came with absolutely so smell whatsoever, even when I have my face on it doing yoga. I got the red color and it’s vibrant and beautiful. The color does not transfer like some super-cheap mats I’ve owned that eventually stain my hands and knees when things get sweaty. I also love using this for cardio with jumps. It has great cushion for landing which is soft on the feet and knees. I also appreciate the extra padding when doing yoga poses like cat/cow because otherwise my hardwood floors really hurt my knees. While it does squish slightly and leave hand and foot dents momentarily, it quickly springs back to its normal shape. Some reviewers mentioned the extra padding being a nuisance when standing on your feet in tough-to-balance yoga poses like tree, but I have have absolutely no problems and it actually feels better on my feet than the hardwood floor or super-thin mats. It has good grip and doesn’t move around or slip even when barefoot. I really like that the ridges on the top of the mat run in parallel lines in only one direction, rather than being cross-hatched or bumpy. Mats with other patterns like that are much harder to wipe clean when dirt gets stuck in the ridges. I also appreciate the included carrying strap to keep it rolled up and to carry it around. Some reviewers complain that the mat is too big and bulky, but I like the thickness and length when using it, so of course it’s a bit bigger than the thin-as-paper mats when rolled up. Duh! Overall, another solid Amazon Basics product. Every Amazon product I’ve purchased so far has been of great quality for the price. Edit: see the photo of this red mat next to my old purple mat. It’s a couple inches longer than a standard mat and about 3x as thick!\n', '\n  This was the listing for it ( AmazonBasics 1/2-Inch Extra Thick Exercise Mat with Carrying Strap, Steel ), but when you add to your cart, the part about the carrying strap disappears.  And the item delivered DID NOT have a carrying strap. Not very happy with Amazon at this moment,\n', ""\n  This mat is awesome! Im an extremely overweight individual trying to get fit and I purchased this mat in hopes of using it to do my floor exercises on, such as sit ups, instead of the bare, hardwood floor. This matter was PERFECT! I honestly wasnt expecting it to be as thick as it was! I was able to comfortably get down on the floor without my knees feeling like they were going break on the floor. Matter of fact, my knees didnt even touch the floor! I also love how its NOT memory foam. Memory foam sinks to your body's pressure and I wanted something that stay firm, but supportive and this matter is it!\n"", ""\n  This mat is reasonably priced, but there are a few things I think potential buyers should know:1. You can't wear shoes on this matI learned this the hard way, after my sneakers scuffed up the mat after a workout session. I could probably have ended up tearing my mat if i continued to wear shoes while using it. Barefoot or socks only if you wish to keep it in good condition for longer.2. It's slippery when wetThis thing turns into a slip-and-slide if you drip sweat on it. Not fun when trying to downward dog.3. It tends to move around a bit during use.Not a huge issue, but it can be annoying at times.All things considered, I like this mat. It fit my budget, and it's a good size. It's my first, so i have nothing to compare it to. But it did fall short in some areas that mattered to me.\n"", '\n  Ok, I admit it\'s early in our relationship - but I like this mat. The smell is WAY overstated by some folks - I used this mat in yoga class 20 minutes after I cut it out of the plastic and it smelled a LOT better than the shared mats in my yoga class.  I later learned this mat is too thick for yoga and I need a 1/4 inch thick mat... ok, I get it but I\'m over 6\' 2"" and I am built more like a lineman than a tall ballerina - so this mat works fine. When I do tree pose my weight converts this mat into a sub-quarter inch thick mat and I don\'t have any issues with a too-soft mat.I\'m sure the strap that came with it is fine  - I gave it to my wife who uses it with her 1/4 inch mat ...It seems to be a good mat even though it\'s disadvantaged having no high-end trademark by a famous equipment company with model spokespersons ... it\'s just a low price thick green Amazon mat and so far it\'s rocking the task -\n', '\n  This mat has a chemical smell that attaches to you like in the Seinfeld episode The Smelly Car.  I have tried everything to get rid of it including ivory dish soap, vinegar, baking soda, febreze, over ten days of sun and fresh air, and eventually an industrial washing machine.  The smell has defeated all of these methods which is quite impressive.  I did use it twice, and it was nice. However, I cannot take the smell.\n', ""\n  Worst purchase ever. I bought this on May 1st 2018 and have had it sitting out trying to air out. Today is June 10 and it still smells like cat pee, And I don't own a cat!! The stench just permeates the room. I would be far too embarrassed to take this to a yoga class. I have sprayed it down TWICE with super grade odor neutralizer and still ZERO luck. Save your money and absolutely look for something else.  Stay with 1/2 inch though, as that's a great thickness. But don't buy here, unless you want this horrible stench to linger in your home or embarrass you in class too.\n"", '\n  Do not buy!The only plus point about this mat is that it is thick. But that is itIt is just a thick piece of sponge, not a yoga mat.It does not have the grip that a yoga mat must have. Keeps slipping.Also, after hardly 2 months of use, it has developed scratches and tears.It also expands in every direction and makes doing yoga more difficult rather than easy !\n', '\n  It is not useful for yoga.. just after one day usage ,it became like shown in picture.. when it delivered ,it was so soft.. but totally sponge is there inside.. it is not sticking to ground while doing yoga.. dont buy this mat..\n', '\n  It’s a nice and thick mat and serves the purpose. Grips well and lengthy as well. 2 feet in width and 6.25ft in length. But the thickness is around 10mm and not more than that.\n', '', '\n  これは売り物ですか？\u3000裏面がこんなに汚れています。これ開封直後です。即カスタマーに連絡し、返品します。届くのも遅いです。\n']"

The link they provided does not have any information on the mat. As a years-long yoga teacher, I have owned natural rubber yoga mats from both Manduka and Jade (currently have 3), and the smell of this Tiggar/Tigger yoga mat is much different. I ordered it because I need a light grey mat for my current teaching situation where I have to record classes. I received it yesterday, and the smell is quite strong. I\'m not surprised the mat was making people sneeze, per prior reviews.It would be helpful if Tiggar/Tigger yoga was transparent about the chemicals used in processing and list them in the Q&A instead of avoiding answering and deflecting the question to a website that has no useful information.The mat is okay. I\'m sensitive to smell, so I\'m hoping the smell will dissipate. Otherwise, I will need to return the mat.\n', '\n  Where to start? This mat is phenomenal. From the amazing natural rubber that it is comprised of (environmentally friendly, safe, & sustainable), to its reasonable price, I cannot find a thing that I am unhappy about regarding this purchase.The size is great (I’m 5’10” & feel I‘ve plenty room for my practice), the thickness comfortable, the colouring & patterning beautiful, & the grip fantastic.I have researched, as well as actively used, many other yoga mats in many styles in my practice over the past decade or so (on & off) that asana has been a part of my life, & this one very much so makes it to the top tiers of my list.Upon arrival, I aired it out for a couple of days to dissipate the natural rubber scent (a normal process for a mat like this), & was immediately on my way to using the mat earnestly & joyfully. Highly recommend it to all.\n', '\n  I have been practicing hatha yoga and bikram yoga for many many years and have used a lot of\xa0 yoga mats made from different materials and various brands.

It is easy for me carrying it around!\n', ""\n  I purchased the fudge. It's more amethyst / mauve but still very neutral. I researched mats for weeks and read what seemed like thousands of reviews before settling on this one.I have 40+ sessions in with it now. I wanted a thinner mat as it normally goes down on a wool carpet and I wasn't getting the stability I wanted on thicker mats. I've used it on wood floors as well with zero issues. I do not normally need a lot of padding. I'm 5'7, 135 pounds and appreciate the length, I have zero issues with the width and rarely find the need to adjust posture.It sticks and stays in place great normally on both carpet and wood floors. Zero shift issues. The edge that gets rolled in curls under a bit no matter how I roll it. I'm getting used to it but in the beginning it did set off my ADD a bit. I practice daily so it is not sitting rolled for any length of time.It stunk when it arrived. I wish the seller was a little more transparent about what exactly is in the mat, i.e. dyes etc. After about two weeks the smell started to dissipate.I did slide a little in the beginning but nothing like other mats and it seems with time the grip is getting better. I have sweaty hands 24/7 and this has been the best mat for stability with that.Overall it seems really durable. I can't see it tearing or flaking under normal yoga circumstances.Lastly it is heavier than other mats in my collection. I don't mind but others might if they're traveling with it a bit, you'll probably want a case with a padded shoulder strap.I'm really happy with the mat. If I had to purchase another I would pick this one.\n"", '\n  Karla.  I have had yoga as part of my life for years.my mats we’re always inexpensive; but they would deteriorate so quickly, hold dirt and I would be forced to buy a new one too often.I then saw a friend in a class with a Tiggar Yoga mat....it was beautiful! I was impressed by the choices of color. I decide to purchase one, the mat arrived...WOW.I could not wait to try it!When balancing, I felt the mat offered a solid foundation. The texture of the finish allowed for a sturdy grip even in hot yoga.This mat offered stability as well as cushioning. When I do floor positions I feel that my hipbones, spine and knees were not feeling the hard floor but rather buffered by the mat.The color of the mat was a calming rich blue that helps center the mind. To conclude, Tiggar mats are practical, attractive and environmentally responsible.\n']"

It is long and very soft, which I personally like. I am older and wanted some extra cushion for knees and elbows. I can see where it would throw balance off a bit due to this softness, but I look at it as pushing me harder to keep my balance. Great mat that I would recommend. I got the pretty blue one;)\n"", ""\n  I tried 4 different mats ranging from $13-$25 and this is the best I've found so far. It's thick and cushy. For the most part it is non slip, but it can still be a bit slippery. My main complaint is that it wears down easily, I have had it for a couple weeks and I already see some breakdown of the material. Overall though I am very happy. I had to return the other 3 mats, this is the first I am keeping.\n"", ""\n  I've used this one time and where my feet plant for warrior 2 and plank is already coming apart. I would not recommend for flow/power yoga. The mat thickness definitely makes it more challenging for balance poses in yoga.\n"", '\n  After reading reviews i was expecting a bit damaged or wrinkled mat. Arrived in a big box inside wrapped in plastic.when opened had slight fishy smell, but after a night unrolled in garage  - no problem at all.Soft, thick as i need it.\n', ""\n  Arrived in good shape. It's uncomfortable to do yoga on for me, I don't find it cushy or comfortable and it seems very skinny. Not wide at all and little room to move around. Has a smell to it. It is sitting in my living room and I can smell it in the next room. Disappointed :/\n"", ""\n  Do not buy this mat. I've never seen a mat that get in such a bad shape after only a few uses. The material is very cheap and becomes all cracked (melted look) after only a couple of sessions. Awful product.\n"", '\n  Yoga mat de súper pésima calidad! Al segundo día de empezar a usarlo comenzó a cuartearse y a desbaratarse como por arte de magia. Materiales súper corrientes. No vuelvo a comprar nada de ésta marca: GAIAM.Por parte de Amazon no obtuve solución a mi intención de devolver el producto para recibir un reembolso. Tres veces me fueron generadas etiquetas para ser devuelto y las tres veces fueron rechazadas por DHL, alegando ésta empresa que las etiquetas que yo llevaba eran duplicas y no servian ya para nada.Ya he realizado devoluciones con Amazon y sinceramente nunca había tenido ningun problema. Es la primera vez que tengo una experiencia así de desagrable.Gracias.\n', ""\n  This isn't a yoga matt. It's a thick memory foam matt. After 2-3 weeks of regular use, already there is wear and tear. Because this is memory foam material, it takes the form of whatever shape you keep it in. Mine came with an ingrained strap imprint already. I would not recommend this product for yoga. It might be a good matt to keep underneath a sleeping bag for extra comfort, but definitely not for regular yoga use.\n"", ""\n  I've used plenty of mats in my time, and I would call this thing a cheap camping mattress over a yoga mat. Absolutely no grip, and does not hold its shape. It's permanently curled after just a few weeks. Feels incredibly cheap. I'd rather use the old ones the studio provides.\n"", '\n  NOT Gaiam Brand!!! Cheap knockoff!!! DO NOT BUY!  SCAM!!!!!Gaiam brand mats are high-quality and have their labels printed directly on the mat. This knockoff arrived from China with no label. The strap also is not a cinch strap but elastic.  This is clearly not the product I purchased as advertised by the seller. I paid $43 including shipping and it’s not at all what they advertised.  Buyer beware!!!!!\n']"
