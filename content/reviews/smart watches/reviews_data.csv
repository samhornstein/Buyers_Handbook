I wouldn’t take the time to write a review if this watch didn’t just blow my mind! I got this watch for my husband for Christmas and got myself a brand new Fitbit Versa 2 for four times the price. Before you start judging me for buying myself the better gift, I wasn’t sure if my husband was going to like a smart watch so I proceeded cautiously when purchasing one.We both open our gifts at Christmas and he liked the watch and we got it all set up on military time and set up the app on his phone to be able to manage the watch. I set up my Fitbit watch and it was almost the same process, and almost the same look and feel when navigating around. Seriously! I paid close to $200 for my Fitbit watch and my husband’s was under $50, and they pretty much do the same basic things. The only difference I can really tell is the extras, such as the ability to download a variety fun watch faces, access to purchase the Fitbit premium service, and a few other things that I doubt I will even use.Long story short, buy this watch and save your hard earned money for something else. It lives up to the 5 stars ⭐️\n', '\n  \xa0Always wanted a watch that you could see full text messages on etc.  This works awesome!  Sometimes my finger doesn’t work the swiping very well but it gets there LOL.  I also am able to set alarms on it via the app, VeryFitPro, that correlates to the alarms on my phone. So now when my phone alarm goes off, I get the same alarm alert on my watch. It will show a pill for medication alarm which lets me know it’s time for my meds. This is awesome bc I don’t always have my phone on my person.  The HEART RATE MONITOR works AMAZING!  Love this function as it is matching my monitor.  The music control will play whatever music was last played on your phone. You can’t see the song list on watch but can start, stop, and pause plus skip. Handy feature.Worth the money!\n', '\n  \xa0I have tried numerous fitness trackers for quite some time now and this one is absolutely fantastic for the cost.It arrived fully charged.  The app was easily downloaded and pairing was pretty much automatic.  I love that it is waterproof for swimming (IP68) and actually utilizing the functions of the watch are simple and easy to learn.First thing, the watch face is easy to read.  I\'ve had numerous trackers with the display text so small it was impossible to read.  You can even see the display outdoors in bright conditions.2nd, the instruction manual is readable, too without a magnifying glass lol...and it\'s been written in full & complete English sentences.  The packaging is also handsome & the tracker comes in different colors.3rd, the watch band is so cool!  Instructions are provided for band removal and any traditional watchband in the appropriate width can by purchased for the unit.  It is also very secure with the band supplied.  I have lost a few trackers walking because the bands were trash and did not secure the tracker correctly to my wrist.4th, the applications work great and are easily customized to your individual specs via the app you bind the tracker to.  The button on the side of the watch allows you to scroll through to the unit you want to measure and the touch screen is responsive even though it is a bit sensitive and it can be easy to scroll too far.  Just pushing the button will take you back to whatever screen you want.I will update my review after I have utilized the tracker for a couple weeks.  Also, it comes with a full 1 year warranty which is important since a lot of economical trackers tend to die within a few months if not sooner.  Hopefully I\'ll get tons of good use from this one.All in all, I highly recommend and it would be a great gift, too!6/23/2020 UpdateI\'m still in love with this watch.  It has not failed me yet, no glitches.  I charge it for about 1/2 hr a day just to ""top off"" the charge.  I\'m positive this watch could go a full week and still have charge.  I seriously do not take this watch off unless I\'m in the hot shower.  It\'s the perfect and simple tracker for those who are on a budget, have never had one, had trash trackers, or those who are electronically challenged.  It is also perfect for elderly because it might encourage activity and good sleep...yes it tracks sleep but you have to wear it. Eww.  Anyway, nuff said.  Get this watch. ✌❤\n', ""\n  I am very impressed with this watch/fitness tracker. I have had a few fitbits that have died on me. I wanted to try something different.This watches battery life is amazing. Im not sure if you can see well in the pictures or not. I charged this up on Tuesday last week. Today is Wednesday. It is at 48% battery life remaining. I am blown away with that.It has find your phone feature. Which is really cool if you are like me and have kids that walk off with your phone. Just push the button on the watch. They will come running out with your phone! 😉The ease of the app is awesome. And pairing it was a very simple process.The only thing I warn and it is absolutely not a problem. Is this watch is called green in color. It's more of a tealish blue. Again not an issue. Just look at the pictures. The 'green' is pretty true to color of photo.The size is pretty awesome too. My 4 year old wanted to wear it for a few minutes. Fit him. Fits me. And i even had a friend try it on. Fit him too.Definately would recommend and repurchase this. Wish I hadnt wasted money on fitbits before!$$\n"", '\n  This is a fantastic smart watch fitness tracker for the low cost. But to start it needs mobile apps (VeryFitPro) which is easy to download and setup via QR code.It’s looks and finish is cool 😎  and look like Apple Watch.After use of a week it’s BATTERY 🔋 life is very impressive which stands for long and quickly charged.It has different mode Sports, Alarm, Relax and Heartrate. It help to track heartbeat and relax your breath by doing inhale and exhale.Now it is easy and I can  track my steps and calories on daily basis & weekly.My son (4.5yrs) try it and it fits and works for him as well.

It looks a lot like the Apple watch and many of my friends have asked me about it.

The display is always highly visible, even in bright sunlight .I have been wearing a wilful watch (exactly the same model) for about 2 months now and it has always functioned flawlessly.

El único inconveniente que las instrucciones no vienen en español, tuve que buscar en internet, fuera de ello esta genial\n', '\n  Wow wow wow!!! This is one of the best things I’ve ever bought. Value for money you bet your booties it does everything that products costing 4 to 7 times more.You will never regret buying this\n', '\n  Delivery was faster than promised and packed really well! Immediately went to charge the watch and set up was easy peasy! I loved the green colour! Instruction manual available in the box in English. Cant wait to use it! Highly recommended!\n']"

It’s also not $300...I had to give this thing a decent amount of time.  Buckle up:  out of the box, it comes with three amazing faces.  It’s not an Apple watch.I can make fun of this watch, but after giving it some time - it’s a really good watch for the price.  It tracks heart rate and sleep time.  It can get the O2 content.  It monitors my heart rate.  It reminds me that i am being lazy.  It tracks my steps.  It receives my Arlo notifications every time a squirrel runs in front of the cameras.Today i setup a fitness tracking and chose the activity i was doing and it monitored my heart rate and provided my calorie burn.It probably does other stuff, but I haven’t figured out everything yet.  It is better than my Fitbit.  There is an app that syncs to my phone that reminds me daily of the pitiful shape i am in.  The battery life is amazing.  The touch screen is responsive.  The app is ok.It’s $40!  I genuinely love this product for what it is.  I think iwatches are dumb and overpriced, but this is worth every penny.I would recommend this watch to anyone.  I am very happy with this purchase!\n', ""\n  This is the first smart watch that I found that has given me a fairly accurate pulse ox reading. This has been especially helpful for work as I've been able to put it on different patients as were doing activities. When measuring pulse ox it does require that the person stay relatively still which can be somewhat challenging if I'm trying to get a reading as they're up and moving. I like that it has gentle vibrations to let you know with the alerts. This has been really nice when we're trying to do a timed activity and I can set the stopwatch or timer for countdown and easily let people know when they should start and stop an activity. The touchscreen works really well and I have the watch paired to my phone so I can easily monitor how my patients are doing. The watch itself is fairly light weight and I like that I can use it in order to check someone's vitals by the second hand on the display. Very clear readings very clear display overall it's been a win for me.\n"", '\n  This smart watch is comfortable to wear and fits tight on my wrist. Setup was simple and easy to get it up and running. The app is fantastic and easy to use pairing with the app was so simple.  The watch face is clear and easy to read.  The touch screen works well.  The watch seems to be very accurate and it does a good job of calculating my health stats while working out.  I am happy with this watch it was a great value.\n', ""\n  Love the user interface of this. It is so simple to operate both from the watch and my cell. It tracks everything and keeps me alerted to my needs or when I've been sitting for too long during the day. There's a few different watch modes to choose from but they all look very sleek and professional. I have not had to charge it yet so the battery life is super long.  It fits my wrist nicely and secure without cutting off my circulation\n"", ""\n  This is overall a really great watch and has a lot of useful functions. The number of steps that it tracks is pretty accurate in comparison to the number of steps shown on my iPhone health app.The touch screen is easy to navigate and the app is very useful to look at the watch's data that it collects (see image attached). Some of my other favorite functions include being able to control your music, oxygen level checking, calories burned, and heart rate tracking throughout the day.The watch's battery also charges very quickly (less than 30 minutes) and the battery life also lasts a long time. The watch's size is similar to an Apple watch and lighter than an Apple Watch.Overall it's a great price for all of its functions and very practical. I definitely recommend this product.\n"", ""\n  And I like it pretty much. We walk in the morning and this morning I used it with the GPS on and sadly, there's no way to stop the training session without turning off the GPS.  I was at home sitting on my butt for thirty minutes before I figured that out. And while it was in the training session, I had zero access to the other watch functions.If I'm doing something wrong, please, please, please! tell me how to do it correctly.Other than that, I like it. Nice to know why I'm so tired every day. I sleep like crap.And life is good.\n"", ""\n  My Wife loves it! I got it for her and since she got it, it has not left her hand. Comes in a nice packaging. Love the look and feel of this watch, feels ver premium and not cheap and does most of the stuff you would expect it to do, like show your notifications and who's calling you, you can also play your music on your phone from the watch. It has a long life battery, definitely can't complain about the battery life. If i had to Nitpick something about it, it would only be that the icons could look a bit better, but like i said, that's just me nitpicking, but for the most, i really find the watch offers more than what you're paying for it. So you'll definitely love it.\n"", '\n  This is my first fitness watch. It seems lightweight and fairly comfortable. I’m not a fan of the silicone band that these types of watches have.  But most fitness/smart watches come with them. The integration with the app works well. I’m disappointed with the battery life. Maybe I’m just not comfortable to let it get much below 40%. It seems to go about 4 days to get down to 40%. The charging cable is easy to use as it’s magnetic. The price is definitely attractive.\n']"

When you wear the Versa 2, the weight is balanced enough that it doesn’t bring any discomfort, and light enough to sometimes forget you have it on.• The design is almost identical to an Apple Watch. With square rounded corners, it’s almost impossible to tell the difference if you had both of them side by side.• I had no discomfort wearing this Fitbit when I slept and had no itchy feeling around my skin when I woke up. Overall, you can wear this all day without any issues.• The screen has great contrast, vivid colors, and has excellent brightness. On a clear sunny day, I put this display to the test and it passed with flying color. Outstanding outdoor viewability.• The Alexa feature does work. I did like the fact that with you can speak to this watch as if it was a smartphone, and Alexa will answer to you (in text). Weather report, nearby stores, and overall a quick way to get an answer (More details later on).• Fitbit is pushing this Versa 2 into the world of smartwatches, as you’re able to control any of your smart home devices with this watch. I only have some smart light bulbs, so my testing was turning them on and off with this Fitbit. Please to say that it worked flawlessly.• I felt the sleep scoring system was pretty accurate. I tested it for almost a week and the graph displaying for my sleep fit my experience. Fitbit always does a great job providing your data in a visually appealing look on the app and in desktop form.• The alarm feature is very useful. When the Versa 2 is tracking your sleep, it will find the best time to wake you up before you “actually” have to wake up. Everyone has a different sleep cycle (light and deep sleepers) so you may expect a different outcome. Usually, it’s within the 30-minute time frame before your alarm is set.• The other fitness programs in the Fitbit (activity trackers, heart rate, distance travel, calories burned, and so forth) are all decently accurate and effective. This technology isn’t new, but Fitbit does make fitness trackers that are consumer-friendly. You’ll be surprised how complex some tracker out there are. If you had the previous Versa, you should expect the same layout.• Some features like the Relax app (guides you through breathing exercises), movement reminders (lets you know when you been sitting for too long) and step counts all stimulated me to be more active. It’s hard to explain but when you see your progress on a graph, or even a number, you feel compelled to keep growing it. Because of Fitbit’s friendly visual graphs, you don’t have to write anything and overall it brings a form of motivation to keep increasing your numbers.• Numerous exercise modes, training guides, and even 10-minute training cycles. Like I mention before, if you need something to motivate you to work out, this will be it.• One of the best features in the Always-On-Display. I’m a huge fan of this because you’re not wearing the watch every second of your life. It’s nice to see that you can leave it on a table and the display will still viewable, like any other watch.• Third-party apps like Uber are available for this watch. I don’t use Uber, but it’s good to know that third-party app companies are putting their foot in Fitbit.• Going for a jog, the watch vibrates when I get a notification, which is just a text for me. It’s also pretty straight forward in deciding what you want to be notified about.• Yes, you can swim with it. Haven’t tested this out though.• Battery life is good, compared to the other smartwatches out there. Around 3 days of use before I need to charge it. Maybe 2 if I’m using it a lot, and the Always-On-Display is on max brightness.Cons and Oks:__________• There is a connectivity issue that I’m dealing with my Versa. It would disconnect from my phone and would take numerous times in trying to reconnect it. I have no idea why it’s doing this  but I’ve noticed past reviews online addressing the same issue. It has to be a software problem because others are not getting this issue as well. Be on the lookout.• Another issue with the connectivity is you won’t know if there is no connection until you physically look at the display. This is a huge issue if you have notifications, texts, and updates coming from your phone to this watch. If the watch is disconnected, and your phone is not with you, you may miss some important stuff.• On the display, I felt Fitbit’s main icons are very unclear. What I liked about Android and Apple is that even if you never used there OS, you can tell where to go with the icons they provide you. The icons that Fitbit provide are very unclear and if you don’t use this device often you’re going to be lost in there OS.• You’re paying decent money for the device but Fitbit restricts a lot of it as they want you to sign up for their monthly “Premium” services. This monthly Fitbit service offers a great deal of programs, but if you don’t want to pay a monthly payment then you’re stuck with the “basic” software of the watch.• No idea why Fitbit did this but you can’t stream Spotify on this watch unless you have premium Spotify subscription. Not only that but you can’t even allow playback from this device to your speakers, phone, etc. I hope they fix this as it seems you need to pay more to use the watch fully.• Alexa provides the basics of communication but other than that I found it useless. The voice recognition lacks useful search results and since there are no built-in speakers, you’ll never get any audio notifications and hear Alexa’s answers. Middle of a workout, you will have to stop and look at the text that Alexa provides.• To even use Alexa, you need to install Amazon’s Alexa’s app on the phone and have an account with it.• No integration with Apple Health and Google fit. You have to stick with Fitbit all the way.• No GPS. You need to connect it to your phone to all GPS tracking. Without it, this creates a reduction in accuracy when you run. I didn’t find it to be that much off, but it’s enough that I think you should know.• Has some thick bezels around the screen.• If you want to change the strap, expect a fight. Fitbit locks the brands pretty solid, so taking them out ain't going to be fun.• I wish that you can customize the Always-on-display because currently, it’s a very simple layout. Not customizable to your choosing.• Currently I can’t respond to text messages with this watch with my iPhone, but you can use this feature on an Android.• I notice that Fitbit doesn’t have a payment system of their own. When you want to buy an app, you’re going to paying directly to the developer, where they can use any payment system they want. So far this isn’t an issue but it’s something to note in the long run due to security reasons.• You can’t even store your favorite apps for quick access.• Up 300 songs you can store on the desktop Fitbit app, but you have to transfer them over WIFI. No wire transfer and depending on your WIFI speed, it will take some time.• When you get a notification, or ask Alexa a question, you’re going to get a one-sentence answer. Numerous times I found this frustrating because you’re not getting any context to help you, and it just leads you to want more.• Your phone needs to be with you to fully use this watch. The Versa is an accessory to your phone.Bottom Line:__________It’s not a smartwatch for your phone. You have to get on board with this idea before you buy this watch. The point of Fitbit is to have a digital fitness book on you at all times. With the Versa 2, It’s a fitness book that does all the writing, tracking, and you’re only requirement is to workout. This is what Fitbit does a great job in. It provides you as much detail as you need on exercises, your workout routines, and your health. I felt the need to check on my stats every day as it’s one of the few devices that can visually show you that you’re improving. A light device, excellent display, and a great motivation tool.But you need to put it in your head, it’s not a smartwatch. The Apple Watch is a smartwatch. The Galaxy Watch is a smartwatch, and this isn’t. Unlike other smartwatches, once you buy this, you still need to pay more to have the full experience. Fitbit premium “monthly” services provide a great deal of data and programs to help you out, but you need to pay for it. Even with the payment you still need to have your phone around as Alexa currently isn’t useful enough other than asking for the weather. With no built-in GPS tracking, limited text/notification updates, and Spotify restriction, you can see why this isn’t in the same category with Apple and Samsung.This is a fitness tool to help you keep your body in shape. Fitbit does a great job in that, but if you’re looking for a smartwatch then go over to Apple and Samsung. Those are smartwatches, this isn’t.Overall: A virtual fitness book that is a must-have for those who want to get in shape but has too many issues to be called a real smartwatch.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer\n"", ""\n  The Versa 2 brings some modest improvements to the original, both inside and out. Here are some highlights:The screen is now AMOLED, yielding brighter colors and deeper blacks.The glass cover no longer has a bezel, giving it a smooth, low profile and premium look.The optical sensor on the bottom is bigger and doesn't protrude from the case, making it more comfortable on the wrist.The music and exercise buttons are gone. A mic to command Amazon Alexa is in their place. She can do things like set timers, alarms, reply to texts, give you the weather forecast as well as a FEW other useful things.The processor is faster. Apps load faster and the touch screen is more responsive.Always on display is now supported.Screen brightness is now always adaptive, though you can preset the base brightness.There is a new sleep mode which turns off autowake and notifications during during selected times so your watch doesn't bother you while you sleep. Do not disturb mode will silence calls and notifications during exercise as well.You can control the Spotify app on your phone from your watch.Fitbit pay is now standard on all Versa 2 editions.*The battery is rated for 5+ days. I've been getting a solid 6.5 with always connected, all day sync, 24 hour HR, and at least 3 hours of running.That being said, the Versa 2 isn't perfect. Fitbit OS is still feature lite, the app store is still rather small and there is still a dearth of useful clock faces. I'd still like to see a screen lock feature, a stride per minute counter and music controls in the exercise app, and a bunch of small. QoL improvements.If you're like me and mostly want an excellent fitness tracker with a handful of productivity features sprinkled on top, then the Versa 2 is for you, especially if you want a battery life long enough to make use of any of those things. If you care less about fitness and more about controlling your phone from your wrist, then you might want to look at a Galaxy Watch or a Fossil Gen 5, especially if you don't plan on tracking sleep, as you'll need to recharge both at the end of the day. If you have an iPhone I don't know why you're reading this.\n"", '\n  \xa0Another update before I return my watch for the second time: it’s 5:36am and my watch says that I slept 8 hours. I’ll upload the imagine. I went to bed at 11:15 and woke up at 5 am. I can’t believe how off the sleeping app is today.An update: my Sister got a new Fitbit versa for me again and I wore both Apple Watch and Fitbit Watch. The step count was very different. Almost 3 thousand more steps with the Fitbit. It counted extra 800 steps while I was in the resting position. Ones again I contacted the Fitbit asking them why this has happened, they told me Apple and other devices  count steps differently. 2856 step difference is huge though.My wife just got her Fitbit Versa 2 yesterday and went swimming with it as it today. The watch initially worked for a few minutes while using the swimming app. After 20 minutes she came out and the watch was totally off. We tried to charge it everything but it seams that it got water fried. It’s supposed to be water resistant up to 50 meters!  The pink band was bought separately. Original was purple. Had exactly same problem with last generation Versa. And from googling it seams that we are not alone with this problem. I returned my watch and asked Fitbit if they would give a discount if I buy a new watch they said they will not. Well I guess I’ll just save up extra and get an Apple Watch. Will definitely send all the videos I had made to the bloggers so others won’t make the same mistake.\n', ""\n  I have used Fitbits for many years - all the way back to the days of the first Fitbit Flex. I have upgraded over the years to the Charge, the Charge HR, Charge 2, and now the Versa I and finally the II.LOOKSFitbit Versa 2 is significantly better looking than the Fitbit Versa 1. The screen has less bezel, and doesn't have that ugly Fitbit logo at the bottom. Even if the screen size isn't a massive increase, it feels as if it is because of the rounded glass. This gives it a much more premium feel. The screen is also now a AMOLED display which means it will provide an ample amount of brightness and great sharp colours in the great outdoors (compared to the LED model of Versa 1).BUTTONSIf you were a fan of the three button system the old Versa has, then look away. Now you have to rely more on the swipes and taps on the bigger screen to navigate. I rather like this more polished look as it becomes sleeker in my view but not everyone may have this opinion.OSThe OS has some new tweaks like a dashboard which enables you to set night mode, do not disturb, brightness and whether you have a screen that wakes on movement or manually. This is quick useful as in the past it took a few more taps and was more clumsy of a process. Overall i have found over the years the Fitbit sleep tracking and exercise tracking to be fun to use and best in class compared to other trackers. The new sleep score system puts all the information together to give you a singular number to compare you sleep on a daily basis.SPEEDThe Fitbit Versa 2 is much snappier thanks to the upgraded internals. Whilst scrolling through, you can tell the touch response to the screen is much quicker than the prior generation.COMPATIBILITYThe Fitbit Versa 2 has a new charger hub, which means you can't use the old Versa 1 charging cable. Fitbit loves making new products that aren't compatible with old chargers. Whilst this is disappointing, at least the Versa 1 straps are backward compatible with Versa 2. So at least you have that. The watch faces are also compatible vs the older Versa, so there is already a massive existing library for you to customise your experience.NEW FEATURESThere aren't really that many new features compared to the Fitbit Versa 1. The main addition worth mentioning is really just Alexa capabilities. Unfortunately i found out that you need to keep the Fitbit app open in the background. It seems to have no problem picking up what I am saying. I have found Alexa to be a bit of a gimmick as the connection is not always reliable. It often tells me that there is no internet connection or the app isn't open and therefore Alexa doesn't work.BATTERY LIFEAccording to the specifications the battery life is supposed to last 5 days. This is 1 more than the old model. After a year with the old Versa, it seemed to decrease in battery life, but this is expected with older devices. I will update in this review once I can put it to the full test. However, Fitbit over the years has lived up to the specifications on every device i have owned (except of course if it is defective). I would expect it to last the full 5 days as advertised. This is far longer than many of Fitbits competitors out there.SHOULD YOU GET IT?If you already own a Versa, and it still works fine, then no - probably not. But if you have a defective or bashed up old on, then you might consider the upgrade. I think given the unreliability of Alexa and connectivity being required to access these smart features, it loses 2 stars for me. However, this is hopefully a software update away from being far far better. I will update this review should anything change.If you are a newbie to Fitbit, then I do think this is a good starter to get into the Smartwatch/fitness watch game. It is less smart than some of the competitors out there like Apple Watch and even the Garmins, but it does what it says on the tin, is reliable and at the end of the day a household name ecosystem that many of your friends will be part of.UPDATE: After 6 days of using, the battery is still at 32%. Fitbit has outdone themselves with the battery life. The connectivity problems with Alexa are still intermittent, but i have found it to be slightly more reliable than when i started. I also found the resting heart rate sensor to be quite different from the Versa 1. I will continue to monitor, as it hasn't changed as much as it usually does in a 1 week period with my Versa 1.\n"", '\n  Es gibt wenig Dinge, die so einfach sind, wie diese Uhr zu installieren und mit dem Handy zu verbinden. Wenn man sich an die Gebrauchsanweisung hält... Wer denkt ""Gebrauchsanweisungen sind für Verlierer!""... Viel Glück. Das kann dauern.Wenn man sich jedoch schön gewissenhaft an die Schritt-für-Schritt Anleitung hält, kann nichts schief gehen. Okay - man sollte das Passwort für sein heimisches Wlan parat haben. Und das für sein Spotify Konto, wenn man Spotify auf der Uhr nutzen möchte. Ich mochte das und das Koppeln war wieder absolut (!) simpel. Ich kann sämtliche Alexa Geräte ansteuern, oder mir aussuchen, auf welchem Gerät Musik hören will. Alles problemlos.Weil ich gerade bei Alexa bin... Ich habe mehrere Male versucht, die Beleuchtung in meiner Wohnung (Hue Birnen) und Wlan Steckdosen von unterwegs aus zu schalten. Und es hat jedes (!) Mal funktioniert. Einwandfrei und zuverlässig. Auch das Smartlock zu bedienen - mit der Vesta 2 keine Probleme. Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass man aus Neugierde und Vorfreude den einen oder anderen Schritt überspringt oder was nicht richtig einstellt. Und das es dann deswegen Probleme gibt. Die Uhr ist einwandfrei und funktioniert wie eine 1!Thema Armband. Da hat jemand geschrieben, dass ihn das Montieren des Srmbandes in den Wahnsinn getrieben hätte und man dafür gute Nerven bräuchte. Na ja, ich hab\' mich auch hier genau an die Anweisung gehalten, das Armband im spitzen Winkel anzusetzen bevor ich den ""Riegel"" zuschiebe und - es hat funktioniert. Ich denke tatsächlich, dass die meisten ""Das funktioniert gar nicht!!!"" Kommentare nur daher kommen, dass sich Leute die Gebrauchsanweisung schenken und dann komplett im Wald landen. Natürlich ist dann die Uhr daran schuld...Ich bin total begeistert und würde die Uhr sofort wieder kaufen! Meinerseits eine Empfehlung für jeden, der sich nur eine Uhr kaufen will, aber es gut findet, jeden Tag auf ein anderes Zifferblatt zu sehen. Ob die Uhr lebensnotwendig ist...? Mit Sicherheit nicht. Aber sie macht unglaublich Spaß 👍🏻 Und wer ohnehin ein klein wenig technikbegeistert ist, wird die Uhr lieben!p.s.Wer sich über den silbernen Rand des Gehäuses wundern sollte - ich habe mir gleich von Anfang an ein Cover für das Gehäuse zugelegt. Genau genommen zwei. Eines mit schwarzem und eines mit silbernem Rand._____________________________________________________________________________________Nachtrag am 18. Januar 2020 - von 5 auf 2 Sterne reduziert.Die Uhr war wirklich klasse. Bis gestern. Denn es geht nichts mehr. Zumindest mit der App. Der App, die unbedingt nötig ist, um die Uhr funktionieren zu lassen. Und dazu der armseligste Support aller Zeiten. Der Reihe nach...Es ging damit los, dass sich die Wlan Einstellungen in der App nicht mehr öffnen liessen. Ich dachte zuerst an einen Fehler, den man durch Neustart beheben könnte. Neustart der App und auch Neustart des Handys. Keine Veränderung. Jetzt wird\'s aber erst richtig interessant! Ich bekam über die App eine Email, in der mir gesagt wurde, dass der Akku Ladestand niedrig sei und ich die Uhr laden solle. Kein Problem - der Akku hält sehr lange. Uhr geladen, alles bestens.Nur liess sich die Uhr ab jetzt nicht mehr mit der App synchronisieren. Ich hatte den FitBit Support angeschrieben. Dort wurde ich auf die Hilfe Seiten verwiesen. Okay. Uhr ausschalten, wieder einschalten. Bluetooth Verbindung trennen und wieder verbinden. App deinstallieren, Uhr ausschalten, App neu installieren, Uhr einschalten u.s.w.  Resultat: Nichts. Nur eine Fehlermeldung, dass die Synchronisierung nicht erfolgen kann. Warum? Das wird leider nicht gesagt. Dann die Lösung aller Probleme: Die Uhr vom FitBit Konto abmelden, die App deinstallieren, App wieder laden, installieren und dann die Uhr wieder anmelden. Klingt nachvollziehbar. Aber jetzt... Die App geöffnet, in meinem Benutzerkonto angemeldet - alles in Ordnung. Jetzt die Taste "" +Neues Gerät anmelden"" gedrückt. Dann kommt eine Auswahl, in der man das Modell anwählen soll, das man eben anmelden möchte. In meinem Fall Versa 2. Dann gelangt man auf ein blaues Feld, in dem unten steht: Einrichten. Da drauf geklickt und - das war\'s. Sackgasse. Nur noch eine Fehlermeldung (siehe Bild). Und damit endet der Versuch, die Uhr in der zugehörigen App anzumelden. Keine Synchronisation mehr, keine Wlan Einstellungen, kein gar nichts.Und zum Schluß die Kirsche auf der Sahne... Der Support von FitBit teilte mir mit, dass das Problem wohl bekannt sei - dass das schon einigen Nutzern so ergangen sei, aber dass man im Moment leider nicht helfen könne. Und man hat sich im Voraus sehr freundlich für meine Geduld bedankt. Ich habe jetzt also eine Uhr, die perfekt funktioniert hat, bis die App von einen auf den anderen Tag einen Bug produziert der alles (!) stoppt und der Support mir höflich erklärt, dass man da wohl nichts machen kann.Ich habe also über 180.- Euro für eine Uhr bezahlt, die wegen eines bekannten (!) Softwareproblems einfach nicht mehr benutzbar ist. Die Foren, die sich mit Smartwatches befassen, haben beängstigend viele Einträge von Usern, die ebenfalls Probleme mit der Software haben. Wenn die Uhr mit der App funktioniert, ist sie erstklassig. Aber wenn die Software so voller Bugs und Fehlern ist, dass die Uhr plötzlich nur noch eine nette Dekoration am Handgelenk wird, ist das nicht gut. Und auch nicht fair gegenüber den Kunden, denen hier offensichtlich übereilt etwas angeboten wurde, das noch nicht durchentwickelt war. Die Uhr geht zurück, vielen Dank...\n', '\n  Ich habe die Fitbit Versa (1) vor der Versa 2 besessen und kann daher die Geräte relativ gut miteinander vergleiche. Daher werde ich mich bei dieser Bewertung primär auf die Unterschiede konzentrieren.Positive Veränderung:- Display ist jetzt AMOLED statt LCD (Dadurch sehen die dunklen Menüs weniger grau und mehr schwarz aus)- Es gibt einen Always-On Modus (Das Display zeigt die ganze Zeit monochrom die Uhrzeit, die Akkuanzeige, das Datum und 2 weitere Werte an, die in den Einstellungen gewählt werden können)- Die Uhr reagiert schneller und das ganze UI wirkt flüssiger- Die Akkulaufzeit soll sich verbessert haben (Ich habe das Gerät noch nicht lange genug um das zu bewerten)- Es gibt ein Mikrofon (Sinnvoll für diktierte Antworten auf Nachrichten und Alexa Steuerung)- Die Standard Variante besitzt NFC (Beim Vorgänger brauchte man die Special Edition, um Fitbit Pay nutzen zu können)- Sie bewertet den Schlaf (Je nachdem wie gut und wie lange man geschlafen hat, bekommt man für die Nacht eine Bewertung, die von 0 bis 100 geht)Neutrale Änderungen:- Es gibt statt 3 Tasten nur noch eine (Ich persönliche habe die beiden rechten Tasten beim Vorgänger nie verwendet wodurch ich die Änderung befürworte)- Das Gehäuse wurde größer (Dadurch ist es nicht möglich Schutzglas, Hüllen oder Ladeadapter vom Vorgänger zu verwenden)Negative Änderungen:- Der Ladeadapter ist katastrophal (Beim Vorgänger ging an der Seite des Ladeadapters das USB-Kabel zum Aufladen raus, wodurch es möglich war die Uhr hinzulegen. Also genauso wie bei der Apple Watch zum Beispiel. Bei dem neuen Adapter geht das Kabel unten raus, wodurch ein hinlegen nicht ohne weiteres möglich ist, ohne die Uhr auf die Seite zu legen. Und nach meiner Recherche passt der alte Adapter wohl nicht auf das neue Modell. Sonst hätte ich schon längst so einen nachgekauft)Im Großen und Ganzen kann ich die Uhr empfehlen.Ich habe mir die Uhr geholt um eine Smartwatch zu haben, die mir meine Benachrichtigungen anzeigt, ein paar Apps bietet, mit der ich bezahlen kann, die mir sagt wenn ich mich zu wenig bewege, meine Tages- und Schlafaktivitäten aufzeichnet und bewertet und die ich nicht jede Nacht aufladen muss. Mit Always-On Display hält der Akku (je nach Nutzung) ca. 4 Tage. Bei Deaktivierung dieser Funktion hält die Uhr bei mir eine Woche.Wenn jemand genau nach solchen Sachen sucht, ist er mit der Fitbit Versa 2 gut bedient.Ich muss der Uhr aber leider trotzdem für den Ladeadapter einen Stern abziehen. Aber auch nur, weil er ohne Grund schlechter wurde als beim Vorgänger. Ich kann nicht begreifen, wie man auf so eine Idee kommen kann...\n', ""\n  Pre-ordered this and delivery was on time.In the box you get the watch, charger, and some straps. There's also an instruction pamphlet, but it's pretty basic. To get started properly you need to download the Fitbit app, after which the app will take you through the installation process. Be warned that there will most likely be a firmware update to go through first, so you need to have the Fitbit on charge.So the charging cable is a custom USB cable purely for the Fitbit. An industry standard cable would have been better - just one less cable to manage.The watch is easy to use. I suggest buying a custom clock face (you can do this via the app. The custom clock faces provide a lot more info). There's a lot of customisation you can do. I have the display set to off, and the watch will switch on the display if you make the action with your wrist to look at the watch (not 100% perfect though).Battery life looks to be very good. I've used the watch extensively for a 24 hour period so far, and the battery is at 84%.Edit: the battery life is awesome. I charge it once a week, even then I reckon I could get a couple more days out of the existing charge.The biggest negative for me is that the watch can sense when your exercising and start to log the activity. Only problem is that is works for some exercise types only e.g. it didn't work for when I did weight training. You do have the option to manually add the activity, or start it via the watch, but given the price of this watch it should log automatically.The other issue I found is with the app. Some clock faces require an activation code. This can only be done via clock face settings in the app, which isn't yet supported for the Versa 2. Edit: this is now fixed.Another issue I found with the app is that it doesn't log a walk properly when using GPS. I stress this is an issue with the app and not watch. What happens is the app starts to log, and then at some random point stops logging using GPS, but still provides the correct statistics, only that according to the GPS part of the stats the walk ended long before it did.I'll update this review as I delve more into the features of this watch.Edit: The watch records your sleeping heart rate, but Fitbit charge a premium for you to see YOUR data. Not impressed. That's one star knocked off\n"", ""\n  It states you can download music onto watch and play from watch, however doesn't mention the additional £9.99 month for the app to do this. Also to track the sleep mode to track sleep disorders isn't in UK yet but will charge for this service when it is. I have had FitBits for some years now but will be moving to another watch.\n""]"

It’s also not $300...I had to give this thing a decent amount of time.  Buckle up:  out of the box, it comes with three amazing faces.  It’s not an Apple watch.I can make fun of this watch, but after giving it some time - it’s a really good watch for the price.  It tracks heart rate and sleep time.  It can get the O2 content.  It monitors my heart rate.  It reminds me that i am being lazy.  It tracks my steps.  It receives my Arlo notifications every time a squirrel runs in front of the cameras.Today i setup a fitness tracking and chose the activity i was doing and it monitored my heart rate and provided my calorie burn.It probably does other stuff, but I haven’t figured out everything yet.  It is better than my Fitbit.  There is an app that syncs to my phone that reminds me daily of the pitiful shape i am in.  The battery life is amazing.  The touch screen is responsive.  The app is ok.It’s $40!  I genuinely love this product for what it is.  I think iwatches are dumb and overpriced, but this is worth every penny.I would recommend this watch to anyone.  I am very happy with this purchase!\n', ""\n  This is the first smart watch that I found that has given me a fairly accurate pulse ox reading. This has been especially helpful for work as I've been able to put it on different patients as were doing activities. When measuring pulse ox it does require that the person stay relatively still which can be somewhat challenging if I'm trying to get a reading as they're up and moving. I like that it has gentle vibrations to let you know with the alerts. This has been really nice when we're trying to do a timed activity and I can set the stopwatch or timer for countdown and easily let people know when they should start and stop an activity. The touchscreen works really well and I have the watch paired to my phone so I can easily monitor how my patients are doing. The watch itself is fairly light weight and I like that I can use it in order to check someone's vitals by the second hand on the display. Very clear readings very clear display overall it's been a win for me.\n"", '\n  This smart watch is comfortable to wear and fits tight on my wrist. Setup was simple and easy to get it up and running. The app is fantastic and easy to use pairing with the app was so simple.  The watch face is clear and easy to read.  The touch screen works well.  The watch seems to be very accurate and it does a good job of calculating my health stats while working out.  I am happy with this watch it was a great value.\n', ""\n  Love the user interface of this. It is so simple to operate both from the watch and my cell. It tracks everything and keeps me alerted to my needs or when I've been sitting for too long during the day. There's a few different watch modes to choose from but they all look very sleek and professional. I have not had to charge it yet so the battery life is super long.  It fits my wrist nicely and secure without cutting off my circulation\n"", ""\n  This is overall a really great watch and has a lot of useful functions. The number of steps that it tracks is pretty accurate in comparison to the number of steps shown on my iPhone health app.The touch screen is easy to navigate and the app is very useful to look at the watch's data that it collects (see image attached). Some of my other favorite functions include being able to control your music, oxygen level checking, calories burned, and heart rate tracking throughout the day.The watch's battery also charges very quickly (less than 30 minutes) and the battery life also lasts a long time. The watch's size is similar to an Apple watch and lighter than an Apple Watch.Overall it's a great price for all of its functions and very practical. I definitely recommend this product.\n"", ""\n  And I like it pretty much. We walk in the morning and this morning I used it with the GPS on and sadly, there's no way to stop the training session without turning off the GPS.  I was at home sitting on my butt for thirty minutes before I figured that out. And while it was in the training session, I had zero access to the other watch functions.If I'm doing something wrong, please, please, please! tell me how to do it correctly.Other than that, I like it. Nice to know why I'm so tired every day. I sleep like crap.And life is good.\n"", ""\n  My Wife loves it! I got it for her and since she got it, it has not left her hand. Comes in a nice packaging. Love the look and feel of this watch, feels ver premium and not cheap and does most of the stuff you would expect it to do, like show your notifications and who's calling you, you can also play your music on your phone from the watch. It has a long life battery, definitely can't complain about the battery life. If i had to Nitpick something about it, it would only be that the icons could look a bit better, but like i said, that's just me nitpicking, but for the most, i really find the watch offers more than what you're paying for it. So you'll definitely love it.\n"", '\n  This is my first fitness watch. It seems lightweight and fairly comfortable. I’m not a fan of the silicone band that these types of watches have.  But most fitness/smart watches come with them. The integration with the app works well. I’m disappointed with the battery life. Maybe I’m just not comfortable to let it get much below 40%. It seems to go about 4 days to get down to 40%. The charging cable is easy to use as it’s magnetic. The price is definitely attractive.\n']"
