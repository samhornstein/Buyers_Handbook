This is definitely worth the money. Nice clear picture. Sound is pretty good. Plus you can hook numerous video transmission electronics to this projector I myself was very impressed with the quality. And I definitely recommend this projector. Oh yeah, Video was shot outside in the backyard. Projector is playing on the back of the house without a screen! Just for FYI.\n', '\n  \xa0I read many reviews on a lot of different projectors before making this purchase. Very satisfied with our purchase. The sound from the projector alone is very loud and clear, we live on a main road and the sound of the traffic does not drown out the volume on the projector. The video is good quality, color is good and it is not blurry. The only hiccup I would say is it seems like there is a slight angle on the side no matter how much I adjust the keystone, barely noticeable though.\n', '\n  When you receive this projector and open the instructions, it clearly states you cannot watch Netflix, Amazon, etc from your phone via the USB connection. The product description on Amazon includes a single vague statement about copyright restrictions for some apps. They know specifically which apps don\'t work but fail to include these details in the product description. You only find out after purchasing the projector. Seems deceptive. This was the main reason we purchased this product.We attempted to use the projector anyway but couldn\'t get it to work. First, the projector stated we needed to enable ""USB debugging"" on our phone but the instructions failed to provide any guidance on this. We figured it out on our own but immediately got another message directing us to ""Update SCR."" Once again, no mention of this in the instructions. Tried researching but no success. We gave up and are sending it back.\n', '\n  \xa0This product is amazing!!It was so easy to use with my iPhone.The huge picture had amazing clarity.Came with an HDMI cord, power cord, projector case, RCA cord and a remote.Thank you so much Jinhoo!!!\n', '\n  Received my projector this morning and couldn’t wait to open the package. I wondered where the Free projector bag/carrying case was, and was glad to find it as part of the projector box; the projector looked safe and secure inside it, it replaced the typical styrofoam padding! I thought this was a great idea! Moving on, inside a smaller box I found the -Instructions manual, -remote control, -HDMI cable, -AV cable, and -Power cable. You’ll need 2 AAA batteries for the remote.I powered the projector and first thing I tested was the iCast feature; it is GREAT!!! No need for expensive adapters! I was able to view apps, web pages, played videos on youtube and websites, as well as videos on phone and messaging apps. I haven’t tested Netflix yet, will update when I do. Although from previous experience, I found that you need an HDMI connection for that. So I’ll either use the included HDMI cable, or the fire stick I have. This projector seems to also work for android phones/tablets via the mCast option. This projector easily turned my bedroom into a home theater. We’ll be definitely enjoying some movies and video games. I recommend buying a tripod for the projector, so you can attain the right height and stability. I also tried projecting onto the ceiling, it works well, however the image was smaller (I had the projector on the bed). Perhaps if you placed the projector on the floor or if you have high ceiling it would work better. The sound of the speakers is decent for movies and such; not my first choice for music, but that’s not why I bought it anyway, so I’m satisfied! The operation sound of the projector is fairly quite, and I had the projector next to me. Overall, I’d buy this projector again! And from past experience with this seller, I can confidently say that their customer support is very responsive and courteous; highly recommended!\n', ""\n  We talked about setting up an outdoor theater for the patio for over a year now - we finally did it this week.  After a relatively brief search, we ordered this item (and separately a portable screen and powered bluetooth speakers).We've watched 3 movies on the patio with friends and neighbors since Friday, starting with streaming video of Hamilton on Disney+!Setup was very easy - the only minor hiccup was trying to connect iPhone - I assumed the USB cable would be the connection, but it didn't work.  I needed to buy the lightning cable to HDMI adapter separately, then figure out how to switch the audio to the bluetooth speakers from the HDMI channel on the iPhone - quick Google search found the answer and we were off and running!Several neighbors have already asked if they could borrow the setup for their parties. A huge hit!!!\n"", '\n  Set up the projector outside at night to watch movies with my friends under the stars. Picture was great, but after 20 minutes the USB port stopped working. Tried different cables and different phones to connect and there was just no signal. After about 30 minutes of trying to get that to work, I connected my Apple TV through the HDMI port on the projector. It worked for about 15 minutes, then would stop every 5 minutes and id have to restart the projector to get it to work again. After 2 hours total of trying to get this thing to work, we finally gave up. It was a bummer and ruined the night.Edit: the company just sent me a brand new one after reading my review which is greatly appreciated. I won’t get a chance to use it until next summer though.\n', '\n  This is great little projector.  It’s lightweight and easily portable to take along to make presentations or show video travelogs.  I like the way iCast allows me to easily connect my iPhone and iPad using a USB cable.  It has built in stereo speakers but allows you to connect other portable speakers for fuller sound using the included cable.  It comes with HDMI and AV cables and inputs so that you can connect other devices such as USB sticks, laptops and Firesticks.  You can attach it to a tripod in order adjust the vertical or horizontal angles to reach the screen.  This beats propping it up with books.  If the screen is still too high you can adjust the picture using their “keystone” feature to avoid distortion of the image.  Its fan is very quiet and the projector is certainly bright enough in a darkened room as the photos show.  You can even adjust brightness, contrast etc. to suit your own tastes.  Navigating the menus is very easy with the remote control which also lets you control the playback for such features as pausing the display.  Although this is a nice projector to show movies outdoors, people who want to take along a projector to make presentations to small gatherings will also find it quite suitable and easy to set up.  The projector arrived the day after I ordered it, 5 days sooner than expected.\n', '\n  \xa0After one week of use so far I can say i am very happy with my purchase.Image is incredible ! Used in living room with plenty of ambient light with zero issues seeing reading text on screen.Had no problems using amazon fire stick and 4K stick.Ps4/xboxone/Nintendo switch all play flawlessly.The fan’s used toCool the unit is producing very little noise. The speakers do not get drowned out by them at all.It also comes with a lens capThe iPhone connected easy with basic lighting plug and USB  have not tried with Android  or other.Really good value for the money,Customer support answers very quickly any questions.\n', ""\n  I was taking advantage of the Prime Day Deals and saw projectors. I opted to buy a cheaper projector but the resolution was fairly low, with native 480p. I stumbled across this projector with 1080p quality and thought the extra money was worth it. I have only tested it for a few hours with the different inputs/sources and it generally seems pretty good for the price point, especially if you want good quality but do not require wireless capabilities.The sound is quite clear with the built in speakers alone. If you prefer headphones or more bass, you can add your own personal audio equipment.I plan on using this for personal use and it would be even better with wifi functions, but it is also fine as is. It is nice to use for watching videos I have recorded, as well as pictures that I had taken during my vacations.One issue I found myself facing is that plugging an android device or iOS device through the USB port does not work. I ordered a type-C usb cable to HDMI, which according to there website should fix the issue. If the problem persists, I will update this review, if not it'll stay as a 5!\n"", '\n  Delivery was super fast.Still giving it 5 stars even though I purchased it for football in my backyard. Unfortunately daytime use is not really a option. But thankfully there are night games. Once indoors and a dark room it worked very well. Speakers are decent and are enough to drown out the fan. But also quite easy to hook up auxiliary speakers.And to finish up there customer service is second to none. Had a few questions trying to get daytime working and they always responded quickly to resolve any problems.\n']"

I could not even believe the amount of quality in this projector!! I ordered one before this one, but I didn’t like it too much and ended up sending it back and therefore got this one.... I am beyond excited to use this for movie nights, family nights, or every night!!! I LOVE this thing and so does my family!!! If you are looking to find something great, look no further!! This is the one!!\n', '\n  We had an amazing experience with this mini WiFi projector. Amazing clarity and very compact. Perfect for backyard party’s and even good for indoor . We really enjoyed and would recommend every one to buy this and affordable.\n', '\n  This is casting right onto my siding of my two story garage. The clarity is incredible!\n', ""\n  \xa0Please read full review. Lot's of info!We did a lot of research and the Bomaker GC355 came out on top. What I like the best about this product are the possibilities. It provides me with all of the options that a good TV would give me, all in a portable package.What I like,HDMI cable - This was included. Which is great. Right out of the box I could start using the Bomaker!HDMI input - This is the best feature. Anything that you can hook up to an HDMI port on your TV will work here. I hooked up a game console. Worked just fine. I hooked up my Apple TV. Worked great. I found that mirroring through the Apple TV offered me more options. The Bomaker's mirroring doesn't support certain file formats that people might be looking for. For example, Youtube, Netflix, MP4. The audio did not transfer. I figured that has something to do with the Bomaker's encoders or licensing. Not a problem. Like I said, earlier, its the possibilities of this thing that I love. Hook up an Apple TV, Roku, Google Chromecast, Firestick, Laptop, etc to the Bomaker's HDMI port and you can watch just about anything.3.5 mm Headphone Jack - I hooked up some old (but good quality) computer speakers that I had laying around. I love re-purposing old equipment! The audio was great. The Bomaker does come with a speaker. the sound is just ok. But for a great movie experience, I recommend external speakers for the stereo experience. It made backyard movie night even more enjoyable.Remote - The remote controller is a good size, large buttons and easy to navigate in the dark. Easier for me to use in the dark compared to my Roku remote. Just my opinion.Lens cover - Always important to have. I'm glad the Bomaker came with one.AV cable - I have not tested this yet but I'm glad that it came with one. I have a handheld game console that outputs AV so this will be cool. The AV cable has RCA jacks (Red, Yellow and White plugs). So you can hookup older sources. For example, a VCR, Playstation 1, Playstion 2, older XBox's, etc...A note about Mirroring - I was able to mirror from my phone to the Bomaker. Pictures and MP3 music worked fine. However, If you want to mirror Netflix, Youtube, streaming etc... I have to do it through a streaming device. For example, Roku, Apple TV, laptop, etc. If you are going to use this for movie nights where you are streaming from your favorite streaming services. I recommend that you get a streaming device that you can plug directly into the HDMI port. Then you can use the Bomaker just like you would use your TV.Video quality - I thought it was just fine. I watched movies through my Roku and they looked great. I think surrounding lights will play a role here. For example, we had a fire going and that may have made the video looked washed out. The darker you can get your surrounding lighting the better.What I don't like -Nothing to report at this time.Notes-The manufacturer states that this projector is not for reading text, like PowerPoint presentations or documents. I agree. The video resolution needed for clear document reading is not going to be the same quality as your computer screen. But I got this for video game console playing, backyard movie nights and photo slide shows. So it works perfectly for that!For the price, I believe it is a good value. I have always wanted a projector. But I was always turned away by the high priced ones and skeptical of the really inexpensive ones. The Bomaker provides the quality and image for what I need it to do.I hope this was helpful.\n"", '\n  I set-up this projector with my laptop to use as a home theater on the back porch.  Solid machine, easy-set up and operation with laptop and Bluetooth speaker.  Currently using with just a white shower curtain for a screen.  Hope to get a proper projector screen in order to expand viewing to the backyard.  Will use all summer instead of going to movie theater.  Will just stream Netflix, Prime, Hulu, etc. and save lots of money.  I can see using this in a basement instead of purchasing a big screen TV.  Lightweight and easy to store.  Would purchase again!\n', '\n  I’ve used inexpensive projectors before but this one way out performed them.  I used indoors in middle of the day with light shining in and projected on ceiling with great picture and used outside at night with a big full moon and projected onto the side of a building also with great picture!  Inside audio was perfect.  Outside was good but we were sitting about 20 feet away from projector so we quickly and easily attached to a Bluetooth speaker using a transmitter we bought for the projector.  That would be my only negative— no Bluetooth on device.  Easily plugged in our firestick and we’re watching our favorite shows on Netflix.  Easy to use easy remote usage.  Very pleased with purchase.\n', ""\n  This projector is better than my TV. It works best at night as far as picture clarity.(which only makes sense) I included day, almost dark and pitch black night photos. Awesome Awesome projector.  I am totally not an electronic wiz, and this was easier than making a sandwich to set up. No cords to hook up, and it did everything on it's own. I downloaded the Prime Video app, found a movie to watch, pushed the purchase button and bam it was on the movie screen. I couldn't believe it. I am a Prime Member so it automatically went to my stored payment method. I chose the screen mirroring selection, and the projector Automatically mirrored my Galaxy  tablet . You can use your phone. You can also hook this thing to your tv, laptop, anything really the cords needed come with it. Again I didn't use any cords. I am telling you super easy for scaredy cat people to do this. I surprised my husband for our anniversary, he did not help me at all. He was amazed lol. Also the sound is loud enough to watch outside, but I plugged our little computer speakers to the projector, ( it has a place for that too )and it was like a surround sound movie theater outside. The price is seriously cheap for how good this projector is. We are using it again tonight for July 4th. Also if you are still not convinced the directions are super short and easy to follow. No crazy technical words. Buy it But it But it.\n"", '\n  Es buen producto, tiene calidad en los materiales y tiene buena proyección de imagen.

MONEY VALUE - I am always looking to get the biggest bang for the buck regardless of what type of product I am buying.  I am willing to pay more money for a more superior product if it means the product will last longer and the quality is better.  However, this projector defied all the odds by being the cheapest at this price point and the best quality.2. INPUTS/OUTPUT OPTIONS - I wanted a projector that allowed multiple types of inputs and outputs (HDMI, USB, and Audio) which this projector had.  Although the audio on the projector is enough for most settings, I wanted a deeper bass and crisper sound for music so the audio output allows me to use an independent speaker.3. TRIPOD MOUNT - Due to most projectors only allowing you to adjust the up and down level by about an inch, I wanted the ability to attach the projector to a generic camera tripod so I could have a full range of adjustment.  Dr.J has that and I am incredibly grateful I decided not to sacrifice that.4. LUMENS - The majority of projectors at this price point were only 1500 lumens (give or take).  300 lumens more may not sound like a lot, but when you are projecting onto a wall in your home rather than paying more money for a screen, the 300 lumens allows the color of the projected image to overpower the color of the wall (being that the wall color is pretty light).5. HDMI CORD - I initially forgot about buying an HDMI cord.  However, when I opened this projector they already had one in the box which works great.  Couldn't believe it was already there for me and they went above and beyond to lower their profit margin by a little bit to have a better customer experience.OVERALL - I would and have HIGHLY suggested this projector to anyone who asks or sees the setup we have at our house.  Due to purchasing it in the winter time I have not tried it outside yet, but as soon as the cold breaks our family will be taking it outside for family cookouts and just fun in the backyard.\n"", '\n  Works great. We had purchased to use outside for movies for the kids. I plan on using in the fall to watch college football with my friends. The picture is clear on the 10 ft screen we also bought. Works with amazon fire stick which was another bonus.\n', ""\n  I wanted to wait until I tried out the this projector and I've had the DR.J projector for two months now.  I can't say I have any complaints or surprises from it!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone else.I've had this hooked up to a blu-ray player and my computer to stream Netflix and Amazon Prime movies.  It has preformed exactly as was described in description.  I don't own a TV anymore, so this is the only way I watch movies and TV shows now.  I run the projector nearly everyday for anywhere between 2-6 hours depending on the day.I have the projector set up so it displays about 100 inches.  I've not noticed any blurriness or any other issues at this size.There are a few things that I do want to echo that other people have already mentioned.  I do not recommend using this in a room that isn't very dark.  I don't have blackout curtains in the room I use it in, and sometimes during the day it can become difficult to see or washed out.  Also, it has an internal fan (projectors get warm so no getting around this), and it can be somewhat loud in a small room.  This can make it difficult to hear the audio coming directly from the projector  So I recommend hooking it up to an external speaker.  Which, it is easy because it comes with a standard audio jack.  I have mine hooked up to a Bose speaker, and ran the cord so the sound comes from the front near the screen.  With it set up in this manner I don't even notice the noise of the fan.If you keep these two things in mind when you order and are prepared for them already, I think you should have an equally great experience with this product.\n"", ""\n  I purchased this for an outdoor party for my kids. As a projector, I knew it would have to be at night. EVEN with our exterior light on, this picture is still very vibrant. Again, I am not comparing this to a movie projector or an epson brand but for the price paid, it is very good. My brother and his wife were over and very impressed. They were looking to buy one for a long time for their game room but didnt want to drop $350+. Neither did I. So I took a chance on this one. The positive views are correct. I do not know what the issues were with the 1 star reviews, perhaps they got a unit that was beat up or something but mine worked great.CONS:Picture Adjustment:I do wish it had a little more adjustment in the focus area. But I imagine I am viewing the picture outside the recommended viewable area.The Remote:The remote IR sensor is on the side next to the plugins. So you can only control it from that side. I know some people were complaining about the remote having to be used right up on the unit, likely because the sensor is on the side rather than on the top. It is annoying but, not something the bothers me alot. Perhaps when I start using it more? But I imagine this is only going to be a problem when trying to change media.Speaker:The built in speaker is kinda chincey. But I expected that going into it. Not only from the reviews, but I ordered a projector. Not a home theatre. It might be ok for a small room but outside, I hooked up some external speakers.PROS:Brightness:Where do I begin. While I would like the unit to be brighter, it is brighter than I expected.USB:I played 3 different movies as a test. Utilizing different movie formats and it played them just fine. Even with a resume function. That I liked alot.Other connectors:I have not connected a HDMI or VGA or microSD card to it. I may one day. More likely the VGA or HDMI but havent yet.RESULTS:WOW! I'm happy I bought this. My daughter is happy and my mother came over and was impressed with the idea of having a 10 foot tv! I even projected a movie on the next door neighbors house which was unfinished and unpainted block and it was ok. Not real bright obviously being unpainted. But the thought of having a 30ft TV in your backyard is pretty cool to me lol. (See the dimmest picture of the bunch)Anywho. If you are contemplating a projector, this one will likely fill the bill nicely.PS. I do not own the movies pictured. Please do not sue me.\n"", ""\n  \xa0This projector is startling good for the price.  Although the positive reviews far outweigh the critical, many of the critical reviews are based on issues that are completely fixable.Major issues:1.  The colour is off - the reds are pink - Yes. This is true of all of the default profiles because they’re horrible.  You have to make up a custom user profile in both the picture and colour menus and adjust those settings.  You can make a dramatic improvement simply by desaturating the oversaturated colours.  Feel free to use the settings that I’ve shown in the pictures and adjust from there to your own preference.2.  Picture is horrible - Yes, again due to the default settings doing the projector no justice.  The defaults are all too bright and don’t have proper contrast, so everything looks completely washed out with no depth or detail.  Again, you just have to fiddle with the settings.3.  No sound or very low sound.  This seems to be a common problem.  My projector came with zero sound coming from the internal speakers and very muffled, inaudible sound coming from an amplified external speaker.  It took one email to Support which was swiftly answered.  I was given an update to upload to the projector and, voila, I have sound galore from both internal and external speakers.4.  You can’t make pictures full screen.  Yes, you can.  You just have to know how.  When you click on a file, it will bring up a preview.  If you hit OK on the preview, it does nothing, but if you hit the play/pause button it starts a slideshow which you can pause on your favorite image.  Then, if you hit the down arrow, it will hide the controls for the slideshow and display the full screen image.5.  You have to be in a completely dark room, with no ambient light, for it to show anything worth beans.  This is simply not true and I assume it’s people just being cranky.  I have watched videos and looked at photos on the projector in the middle of the day with the blinds closed, with ambient light in the room, and had no issue watching.  And, projectors are generally intended to be used in darkened rooms.....6.  You can’t read any words on the screen.  Yes, you can.  (See my photos for proof) I wonder if some people just don’t have a clue how to focus?  And, the ad for the projector specifically states that it’s not suitable for Powerpoint or similar word presentations.  So, maybe tiny words are not legible?  I don't know.  I haven't tried that.7.  The lens is wobbly.  Yes.  It is.  I find that my projector can tend to lose focus over a period of time as the projector heats up and works.  But I’ve been able to lock it in place with a little creativity.8.  It’s unbearably loud.  This is just typical of projectors in general.  They’re hot.  They have fans that make noise. Imagine that.  However, I can hear the movie just fine both through internal or external speakers.  They can drown out the sound of the projector fan with little trouble because it's not really unbearably loud.9.  QC sucks.  Yes.  I agree.  I think that they need to make greater effort when it comes to quality control.  This sound issue shouldn’t be a common problem as far as I’m concerned.10.  You don't get any sound when you connect your computer via VGA.  Of course you don't - VGA transmits picture, it does not transmit sound.  The sound will play through your computer.Please look at my images for details.  Compare my Custom User settings on the Strawberries to the default “Vivid” profile to see the difference.  These images were taken in the middle of the day - projected onto a soft grey wall at an approximately 80” screen size.  In other words, these images were taken in less than ideal conditions.After a day of tinkering, I’m very happy with the result.  At the price point, I’m pleased as punch.\n"", '\n  \xa0For what you pay all I can say is I am very impressed my husband had bought a $880.00 unit a little over a year ago. I find the sound quality better then the expensive one. I bought this to take with us when we camp in our little trailer or if we are visiting friends with it being so compact and light.Where as our hugely expensive one has all the bells I found I could do the same with the manual adjustments on angles etc. If you are just starting out and cannot afford an expensive TV then this is definitely the way to go.Have tried it with our Telus PIK TV box, Roku, Memory stick, External Hard Drive it does it all. If you have a teenager and your thinking of giving them their own space, this would be the ticket to consider. The picture quality does degrade a little at the bottom but that is due to the fact it is on an angle and adjusted until my stand arrives.Very satisfied for the price to be honest I am surprised it is so cheap.UPDATE: 15th March 2020.Since we bought this can say have a had an enjoyable time with watching movies TV shows etc, have added items to make our watching experience more enjoyable. An ANKER speaker which is an amazing to upgrade the sound. Also bought a small USB hub so I can have a USB memory stick and also charge the speaker at the same time.  Since the ANKER speaker works on for 24 hours on a full charge, do not have to have it plugged in all the time.Now that we have a tripod to mount the projector the quality of the picture is even better. Cannot complain about the quality or the value for money. Also when I posted this original post received a free carry bag for travel.\n', ""\n  \xa0This projector is really nice, it fulfill my needs. I needed something light and not dangerous for my baby, a TV could fall and it's too complicated for me to hook it to the wall, so the best solution for watching movies safely at home was this projector.We just have time during the evening to watch movies, so it's prefect for us, I tired it during the day and it is not that powerful, but it works. This projector gives me the sensation that my eyes don't suffer with bright lights like a TV.It does no have an option to fix the angle from the sides so you must locate it in the center. In my case I had to put it like 20° to the left, and it still works, however it doesn't bother me, the image is clear.I have a small place, so this is prefect and convenient for me... Check the pic and video.The sound is great for me, not like a big sound system but is fine.\n"", ""\n  \xa0The product description does not do this projector justice. It comes with a full 100 inch projector screen, remote control, HDMI and VGA wires, cleaning kit, and much more. The projector is light and can fit in one hand, but has every single port you could want (HDMI, USB, SD, VGA, AV, etc.) and is one of the brightest and clearest projectors I've used (even compared to full sized projectors). Warranty and direct customer service by the manufacturer is included. Official resolution is 480p, but when showing HD video, the quality ends up looking closer to 720p in real life. For anyone who wants a projector for casual at home use, I don't think there is a better option on the market. Just keep in mind that the projector is only clearly visible when the room is dim or dark, but that applies to most projectors.\n"", ""\n  \xa0The item came within 24 hours. The performance was beyond my expectation! I am a very happy customer and would gladly recommend, you will surely get your money's worth.\n""]"

The projector itself is a bit larger than my samsung phone and is relatively quiet. I ramped up the volume all the way and should have no trouble hearing if sitting close by. However if you need it louder there is a speaker port. It does come with an av convertor cable but it does not come with the hdmi convertor cable. Also no lens cap, heads up! I'm totally happy after some struggling and YouTube watching that it works exactly as I hoped for. I'm so pleased!\n"", '\n  \xa0This was one product that I am completely glad to have invested in! The size of the projector is wonderful! I plugged in my Roku Ultra which is also HD and the picture quality was great! Considering I don’t have much wall space for projection, I currently have it at about 50” or so and the picture is as clear as a TV! For the price, this was an awesome! Having USB and HDMI allowed me to turn a small projector into a complete tv and sound system! I will definitely recommend this product and continue to use this brand for other electronics!\n', ""\n  I absolutely love this projector! It really is a good value for the price. The picture is very clear, and it's small and portable. I like that I can move it from room to room. This was a better purchase than buying a tv. Especially because I stream everything on my laptop. I highly recommend this to everyone.\n"", '\n  The appearance is exquisite, the hand feels very good, and it looks good. It is very clear during the day when projecting. The following picture shows the actual effect of no curtains being drawn during the day. At night, the effect is comparable to that of a theater. It is very clear. The entire wall of the picture is enough to match the standard theater. The effect is magnificent. , The sound is shocking. The actual operation is simple and easy to understand, easy to use,\n', '\n  I needed a mini projector to put up a webpage from my laptop or iPad that interacts with a laser and a camera phone, but I didn\'t want to spend a lot. I found this projector, and looking past the ""for kids"" marketing I found a LOT of value packed into this little guy. Now that I have the projector, here\'s what I found:1. It powers from my Ravpower powerbank perfectly. No issues, just plugged it in. How cool is that? Time for some videos with the fam out in the woods.1. It\'s small and light! Easily carried in a backpack for those hike-in overnighters.2. The brightness is definitely much brighter when powered from a wall outlet. Maybe even 50% brighter. A very noticeable difference, so I\'d recommend using the wall outlet as much as possible. The closer to a surface you set the projector, the brighter the picture will be, but also smaller. The closest I could get this to a wall and still get a focused picture was about 2 feet, which produced 1.5 foot picture. But the brightness definitely surprised me!3. The projector has a little speaker on the back that can get really loud, in a good way. Obviously not a Bose stereo system, but does the job well without needing an external speaker (although there is a headphone jack for just such a use-case, but no bluetooth connection). Use the included remote control to adjust the volume.4. The remote control is very responsive (and required for many of the menu options in the settings as the projector itself doesn\'t have up and down arrows, just left and right). You\'ll need 2 AAA batteries for the remote which are not included in this product.5. There\'s a little screw mount (standard size) on the bottom of the projector for a tripod. I recommend picking up a small, cheap tripod so the angle of projection can be easily adjusted. Keep in mind tho, there is no keystone adjustment.5. I got my Roku Stick, Chromecast, and Apple TV all to work through the HDMI port without issue. Again, just plugged them in and switched the source to HDMI. Looks and sounds fantastic. And from either the Chromecast or the Apple TV I was able to wirelessly cast my iPhone and iPad screens to the projector. Super convenient!6. The picture quality and brightness will not match a more expensive projector. The edges of the projected screen were noticeably darker and fuzzier than the middle, but nothing that gets in the way of an immersive experience once media is played. I\'ve really enjoyed using this little guy!All in all, you can\'t beat the value and features on this little projector. I mean, it works great, but if the kids drop it or hypothetically after a couple years it stops working, you\'re only out a fraction of the cost of typical projectors. I highly recommend!\n', '\n  I was initially hesitant because it was so inexpensive, but it was a big hit and worked out great for a family ""drive-in"" night during the pandemic.The kids really enjoyed being able to watch shows on the ""big screen"".The sound was fine for their enjoyment and it integrated seamlessly with the Roku.\n', ""\n  I bought this as a surprise for my husband for our bedroom which isn't very large but does hold a king size bed and large side by side dresser. I set the projector up on shelf above the back of the bed to project on a blank wall in front of the bed and its perfect. It gave just the right size picture for our room and not over pixelated. We've been able to hook up our cable and our Fire stick then watch whatever we want, when want.

I was highly skeptical of this working, but after following the simple directions to set it up wirelessly, my iPhone was able to see the projector as an ""Apple TV"" and mirror its screen onto the projector without needing to install anything at all.Cons:- No lens zoom, so projected image size is directly determined by distance from screen to projector, which means less versatility in placing the projector. If you don\'t have the right environment, you either will end up with a small projected image or a large unfocused image.- Although the addition of an optical keystone (adjusting the trapezoidal distortion of the projected image when the projector is angled up or down from level) was nice, any adjustment severely affected the image quality at the edges. Even when the center was sharp in focus, the sides/edges/corners of the image had significant ghosting and could not be brought into focus. Granted, the user\'s manual does mention that adjusting the keystone can affect edge sharpness, but this does limit the versatility of the device along with the lack of zoom, requiring you to perhaps make a makeshift stand to prop the projector up and avoid using the keystone adjustment to preserve image sharpness.- Vignetting (bright center of image but picture gets darker towards corners) can be seen on solid color screens, but not as noticeable during normal usage- Fan can get somewhat loud, considering how close the projector needs to be due to its lack of zoom.Overall, I\'m impressed at what this projector delivers at its price point, although if image quality is a top priority, you may want to consider spending more on something else. The lack of zoom and loss of sharpness from keystone adjustment were the biggest issues that I encountered with this device, so keep in mind that the tradeoff for the sheer portability of this device is also its downfall in that it might not be as versatile to position and place for optimum image quality. For those who just want a convenient, small projector that can easily and reliably mirror your smartphone or tablet screen without breaking the bank, you might just be pleasantly surprised with this projector.\n', ""\n  \xa0Great little projector!Pros:- Portable- Easy connection to devices, especially wirelessly- Simple setup- Great quality for the money- Loud audio- Inexpensive- Comes with several cables and remote control- BluetoothCons- Audio could be better (easily fixable with speakers)I don't need to purchase a TV for the bedroom anymore. I just quickly connect my cellphone to the projector and that's it! Quickly put it away when I don't need it. Great little product.\n"", '\n  Ok, first of all Im fairly tech savy. Not that its overly relevant in this context, but I have some coding experience/am pretty handy with computers. This was not “plug and play”/straight out of box wireless set up. I was able to set up wireless mirroring using data from phone. After 1.5 hr, was unable to set up wireless mirroring with wifi. I attached the projector to wifi and are was then unable to stream using wifi (because you have to go to some janky website to enter your wifi info which again is hard to do when your wifi is attached to the projector). Contacted seller and got a response “to please attach pictures.” What pictures?! Its not linking up to wifi! So, anyway be ready to be frustrated, use your data, or what I ended up doing, wiring roku old school style via provided hdmi. It worked fine like that, image good, speaker ok. Just be aware, its not really wireless/easy set up, a little confused about all the reviews saying otherwise. Am considering beginning refund/return process. Edit; also fyi, direct connect using original apple cord did not work either; got “trust” pop up message once, hit ok w no response, no screen mirroring, no further recognition of apple charge cord so...limited work arounds, be ready for it!Edit #2; the seller did provide excellent customer service and sent a new unit. At the tine of this edit, I have not had time to check that one out in terms of connectivity, but five stars now bc of responsiveness and (hopefully) resolving issue.\n', '\n  This projector is not big and is very portable, as long as you a wall plug available. This projector is really great for the little kids for when they sleep over. They have their own screen to look at and great to game on.

I was used to projectors at school and barely being able to see them with the lights off, also not to mention the color yellow almost being non existent. This projector has no problems and has every color you want to see. It has Miracast for when you want to wirelessly share your iPhones screen.

Seeing as Amazon combines numerous models into the same review pool, I felt the need to specify.  I have only had the projector for a couple days so this is a honeymoon-phase review and I will try to remember to update this review later on after I have had a while to put it through the ringer.  I will compare the 2150ST to the Optoma GT1080 in this review as well.  Having said all of this, let\'s get to the review.**Picture Quality**This projector\'s picture quality is simply remarkable.  I am highly critical of anything I purchase with my evaluation of electronics being especially stringent.  Compared to the Optoma GT1080, the BenQ has better colors; equal or better black levels; less rainbow effect (abbreviated RBE); and better focus uniformity (perfect).  Many people are concerned about the rainbow effect, so I am here to say that it is all but non-existent on the BenQ.  The Optoma had some rainbowing that wasn\'t bad by any means, but it did show up without even purposefully looking for it.  It didn\'t bother me much, but having now used the BenQ I feel spoiled.  Quite literally the only way I can even observe the RBE is by putting up a high contrast scene like the grid test pattern and darting my eyes across the image.  Even then it takes a few passes with my eyes to find it.  The black levels are as dark as or darker than my TV (Sony KDL W700B).  For empirical comparison the Sony TV has a Black level of about 0.020 cd/m2 (taken from the W800B review on Rtings.com.  The W800B is the W700B, just with 3D).  This is with my projector being used on a light-green wall.  Theoretically a darker wall would improve the black levels and contrast overall.  The colors are even better than the Sony TV and much better and more natural than the Optoma (This and the lack of RBE are thanks to the 4X/6X speed, RGBRGB color wheel compared to the Optoma\'s 2X speed, non-RGBRGB color wheel).  The final point of comparison in this category would be focus uniformity.  Here the BenQ takes the win with no question.  The Optoma had fairly blurry corners as well as chromatic aberration (especially the top right corner) when the middle of the screen was used to adjust focus.  This resulted in me having to find a happy middle-ground between top-right corner focus and center picture focus.  The Ben Q immediately provided perfect focus without any chromatic aberration across the entire ~135"" image.  In short, the picture quality on this projector is remarkable.**Operating Experience**This section is meant to address the ease of operation, the operational capabilities, and the things that may be easily overlooked by potential projector purchasers.  First of all, the BenQ has MANY more options provided in the menus than the Optoma.  They both have digital, vertical keystone and the usual gamut of gamma, color, contrast, etc. settings.  The Ben Q, however, has many other settings on offer for the person who really wants to tinker with the projector.  My personal favorite is the color correction option that adjusts the image based on the color of the surface you are projecting upon.  The remote has all of the things that you use frequently/somewhat frequently on it (I will post a picture).  Please note that at least one of the buttons (PiP) is a dummy for this model, at least as far as I can tell.  The remote also has a red backlight (Woohoo! Backlit remotes just like the old days!).  The brightness of this remote is much more usable than the blue backlight on the Optoma\'s remote (the Optoma\'s was positively blinding).The BenQ has a slightly longer requirement for projection distance than the GT1080, but both being short throw in nature, this isn\'t a huge problem.  You can look up the specific values for yourself if you want more detail.  The BenQ is also slightly more forgiving than the Optoma when it comes to placement due to its 1.2X zoom capability.  This also has a VGA port and a Serial port which the GT1080 does not.**Value**Seeing as this projector just released a few months ago (August 2016) it is at full price, $1000 (~$1060 after Michigan taxes).  I am not at all upset with the price I paid considering the quality I received.  The Optoma left me a little underwhelmed, it lacked a bit of color and the issues I mentioned earlier bothered me enough to return it after about a week, at which time I decided to purchase the BenQ instead.  Now, the Optoma is around $400 cheaper than the BenQ, so yes the BenQ should provide better overall quality.  The GT1080 is not a bad projector, I know my words may make it seem like it is, but this is an objective, critical review, there are no participation ribbons being given.  For me, even though the Optoma is much cheaper, I think the BenQ has a better value, the higher price point is more than made up for.**Gaming**I\'ll keep this short and sweet.  There is no perceivable input lag.  I would say it is equal to or faster than my Sony TV (24.3ms via Rtings W800B review).  Remember, INPUT LAG AND RESPONSE TIME ARE NOT THE SAME THING.  atleast 70% of the time when I see someone say ""response time"" they actually mean input lag.  Input lag is what makes your controller seem out of sync with your TV, like when you hit a button on the controller to make your character do something and there is a delay before your character on screen actually executes that command.  Most people can\'t notice anything less than 30-35ms, while some people can notice anything above 10 or 20ms using a controller, although at that point it isn\'t really a problem even though it can be noticed..  Response time on the other hand has to do with how quickly the pixels on your screen can change color (usually gray to gray or black to white).  Response time on any respectable display will be 5ms or less.  A slower response time will lead to ""smearing"" or ""blurring"" on your display.  Think of it like in a movie or show where the character takes drugs and everything seems to look really flowy when they move or like they have a trail following them.  That is an extreme example, but it gets the point across.  This projector uses Digital Light Processing (DLP) to create its image, with DLP any ghosting/blurring is actually impossible from what I have learned through numerous articles.  I never see any response time symptoms as I shouldn\'t.  Think of it as posessing a response time of 0ms.**The Little Things**Both the Optoma and BenQ came INCREDIBLY well packaged.  The BenQ even more-so.  The remote for the BenQ has a satisfying tactile feedback/click to it.  Both projectors have built-in speakers should you need them.  I haven\'t used them on either one so I can\'t comment on their abilities, but they are there.  If you are buying a decent projector, you should have something better than the built-in speakers to use, hence my avoidance of using them.  However, they do have their place.  It\'s really comforting to know that I can bring the projector over to a friend\'s house or outside and, with no further equipment besides a Blu-ray/DVD player, have a movie theater-like experience, especially with the short-throw nature that makes it easier to find a spot to project.**Negatives**If I had to pick out some negatives, it would be that the black level could be better and it could run a bit cooler.  It is not plasma level or OLED level blacks, but it is most certainly as good as the high-end LED TVs.  The temperature level isn\'t something that affects my viewing environment in any substantial way, however, being a techie, it bothers me when any piece of technology runs hot.  Perhaps this high heat is just inherent of traditional projector lamp technology, but it still bothers me.  In all honesty, these are the only things I think could be improved on this projector.  Also, at this price point, I don\'t think you will find anything better.  When I update this review later on, I will be sure to include any new or exacerbated issues that I encounter.**Conclusion**If you are deciding between the Optoma GT1080 and the BenQ HT2150ST, get the BenQ.  They both are good projectors, but the BenQ is a tier or two above the GT1080 in quality and experience while coming in at a price that is only 1 - 1.5 tiers higher.**Full Disclosure**I purchased both the Optoma GT1080 and the BenQ HT2150ST with my own money.  I was not in any way, shape, or form compensated for the review of these projectors.  I am just a 22 year old college student with high standards and the desire to give credit where credit is due and call out any downfalls so that they can hopefully be improved upon in the future.Being one of the first reviews for this product, I really hope this is comprehensive enough for anyone looking to purchase this projector.  Thanks for reading!\n', '\n  Product was shipped with a defective hdmi slot that does not hold the cord in tightly. I wrote to product support and they had me change the cord assuming that might fix it. Long story short I did all these steps and nothing fixed the issue. The screen goes black once or twice every minute. I wrote back to support to fix the original issue but now it is “out of warranty” so they want to charge me, even though I reached out about the issue a week after receiving the product. It’s a nice projector; but you have to decide if you want to take the risk spending $1,000 on a product the company won’t stand behind.\n', '\n  This is my second projector.  My first was the Optoma GT1080.  Going from the Optoma to the Benq was a much bigger leap than what I was expecting, in every way.  The high quality of this projector makes the Optoma seem like a toy.  The device alone looks much nicer, the remote feels nicer, setting it up is far nicer and easier. But, to be fair the Optoma GT1080 is a good bit cheaper.Image quality wise the Benq has amazing colors thanks to the RGBRGB color wheel, it\'s incredibly close to the colors of my Samsung Plasma TV, which is very impressive.  It also has great sharpness and clarity, I honestly did not think a 126"" 1080p image could look as sharp as a much smaller 60"" 1080p Plasma TV, but it very much does.  So to sum up the pros, I very much understand why so many others gave this thing 5 stars.  I\'m loving it so far.For the cons, I don\'t have many, overall they are nothing major.  The biggest one is when I first plugged everything up I could not get a signal with my Sony receiver.  Odd thing was I had audio, but no video.  It took me a while to figure out it was the HDMI cable, which worked fine for my Optoma.  It turns out the Mediabridge HDMI cable I was using had a too short male connector (the tip), no idea how it worked in the Optoma, but the only way to get a signal with the BenQ was to push really hard so it would reach the back of the input, then if I barely touched it, the signal would drop.  So once I got a new HDMI cable it was perfectly fine.My other problem is much smaller and has to do with the front leg adjustment.  It\'s a bit of a pain to use and doesn\'t exactly have the finest positioning.  This will only be a problem if you use the projector on a table though.  So all I ended up doing was getting a super thin piece of cardboard and put it under the front leg so my image was positioned exactly at the top of my screen.  Besides that I haven\'t had any other issues.  I\'m very much enjoying it with movies and video games.  The picture is just incredible to me.  The best way I can describe it is, it just looks right.  It really looks like a giant plasma screen.  I uploaded some pics of Horizon Zero Dawn, SteamWorld Dig 2, some colorful parrot, and a pic of some mountains from the Amazon Fire screensaver.  (I\'m also using a Darbee 5000S)\n', '\n  \xa0This is a great gaming projector overall. It\'s very bright and has great input lag. I personally think it has a better picture than the GT1080. It does fall short to the HT2150ST but costs considerably less. It\'s definitely worth checking out.PROS:Bright, colorful, and sharpShort Throw (100"" screen from 5ft away)Great input lag for gamersSmall and lightweightCompetitively pricedCONS:Fan Noise. Can be distracting if you\'re sitting right next to it.92% Rec. 709 Color Coverage (less than HT2150ST)2x Color WheelNo lens shift\n', '\n  PROS: La imagen es muy clara, tiene buen brillo y al ser de tiro corto no se necesita mucho espacio para utilizarlo.CONTRAS: La lámpara solo duro 11 meses, en el servicio de Ben Q me dijeron que tenía poco más de 2,000 horas (lo cual, tampoco era cierto ya que no el di todo ese uso en solo un año) y aunque prometen una duración mínima de 3,500 no la cubren con garantía si tiene más de 1,200... Ellos tampoco ofrecen servicio de refacciones o reparación, solo te contactan con proveedores externos.\n', '\n  The unit is fantastic. Great colour and the brightness is good enough for our relatively dark room.We ended up returning the unit because with just  under 9 feet of projection distance the image was just too large to watch comfortably in my small room. Double and triple check your measurements (use the manual from the BenQ website). At 95 inches we got a 118 inch screen which was too large for our space. Ended up getting the HT2050A which is almost identical to this unit but is not technically short throw and has a few other interesting features over this model for 200$ CAD cheaper.\n', '\n  Bought this projector along side the optima 1080darbee for comparison. This projector outperforms the competition in every way except throw ratio . The 1080darbee can create a 130 inch diagonal image from only 6.5 feet while the BenQth671st can accomplish the same 130 inch image from 8.1 feet. I compared the two images on the same surface using a ps4pro. The picture quality and colour reproduction are great. The website states 92% or rec 709. Once calibrated I must say it looks gorgeous. When it comes to light output, its about 20 to 25 percent brighter then the 1080darbee. Yet they both state 3000 lumens on their respective spec sheets. The contrast is also very good. The light and dark parts of the images stand out a bit more. I would say that the hues and colour gradients are better represented. With less clipping and saturation problems. The black levels are great once calibrated to your specific situation ( scene type, wall etc ). further more, this is a great P.J for gaming with only a 16.8 millisecond lag time, just like the 1080darbee. These projectors blow any 4k tv out of the water buy at least 12 to 20 milliseconds. If your in the market for a compact affordable well rounded short throw projector this might just be the one your looking  for.\n', '\n  I bought this while it was on sale $829. It is a night and day difference from all the sub $300 projectors you see from the chinese competitors. I used this mostly to watch tv shows, movies and play PS4 games. It was amazing during the daytime with lots of lights coming thru my window. The picture is very bright and crystal clear. I was projecting a 120"" screen from 5-6 feet away. Gaming was also great as I was playing COD. Input lag is one of the best for a projector at around 16ms according to the review sites. If you are debating between this and the other benq 2150ST. Get the 2150St if you have the extra cash. It is brighter. Even though it says only 2200lumen. It is because the color lumens are brighter than the 671ST color lumen brightness. At daytime the 671ST edges it out in brightness. But once you turn down the lights. The 2150ST beats the 671ST in color and brightness....If you wanna save some money. The 671ST still amazing.\n', '\n  Este proyector es impresionante, su calidad de imagen es muy buena, su sonido es decente (aunque el Home theater es indispensable para una experiencia perfecta) y el hecho de que sea de tiro corto lo hace muy útil en espacios pequeños, ya que con poca distancia puedes lograr una pantalla mayor a 100"". PERO tiene un GRAN PROBLEMA que no afecta a todos pero si a muchas personas como a mí: el EFECTO ARCOIRIS. Esto es algo que debes considerar muy bien antes de hacer una inversión en un proyector con tecnología DLP, ya que ciertas personas pueden percibir manchas de colores en las zonas claras de las imágenes proyectadas. Para algunos no será una gran molestia, pero para otros es un problema grande ya que un simple movimiento de ojos o de cabeza provoca que se vean ""arcoiris"" en las zonas más claras. ¿Cómo puedes saber si eres susceptible al efecto arcoiris? Solo probando un proyector DLP y moviendo la cabeza y los ojos de un lado a otro mientras miras la película. Mucha gente no lo ve, otros lo notan poco y no les importa, y otros lo ven todo el tiempo y causa cansancio ocular y dolor de cabeza. En mi caso no es tan grave, pero si es molesto, yo no sabía que era susceptible a esto hasta que lo noté en mi primer noche usando este proyector. Yo no lo noto en la imagen, de hecho la calidad de proyección es excelente a mi punto de vista, sin embargo para mí, este efecto es extremadamente notorio en los subtítulos y cuando hay letras blancas sobre fondo oscuro. El hecho de estar leyendo y ver cuadritos o manchas de colores en las letras cansa y marea. Aún no sé si pueda acostumbrarme a esto, pero me estoy inclinando seriamente por devolver el aparato, ya que no es mi primer proyector, tengo uno de LED portátil que, aunque es de una resolución pequeña, no me da este problema y he disfrutado muchas películas con él. Decidí que era hora de hacer un brinco a un proyector con una mejor resolución, y este no me pareció una mala opción (el precio estaba en oferta), pero sinceramente no creo que mis ojos soporten este problema. Si tú no sufres de esto, entonces te recomiendo mucho este proyector (claro, comprándolo a buen precio), si has probado antes proyectores DLP entonces ya sabes si el efecto arcoiris te afecta o no, pero si es tu primer proyector entonces estarás echando una moneda al aire para saberlo. Es triste porque me gusta mucho este proyector, pero creo que no es para mi, ya que nunca había terminado con dolor de ojos después de ver UNA sola película, como si me hubiera echado un maratón de Harry Potter y el Señor de los Anillos. Si no ves películas con subtítulos quizá este no sea gran problema para ti, pero leer subtítulos y ser susceptible al efecto arcoiris es una mala combinación.\n']"

Planned to use SD cards and USB sticks only.  Well, what they won't tell you anywhere unless you dig into the manual online is that the max SD card size you can use is 32GB.  Are you kidding!?  I have a 256GB card in MY PHONE.  Worse yet, it can only be formatted in FAT32 (almost completely obsolete) or NTFS.  Well, my Mac can't format the card to NTFS, so I am stuck using FAT32 which has a maximum file size of 4GB.  I don't have any video files that are that small.  Who does?  It seems this thing was designed for people who live in 2005.  Or for people who want a WIRED connection to their battery-powered projector.  Great job, ViewSonic.  My return is on the way.\n"", '\n  \xa0We purchased this projector for backyard movie nights for the kids and camping trips.  We’ve considered cheaper gadget projectors, but after some more research we’ve narrowed the selection down to Nebula Capsule  and M1.  Both Nebula and M1 are based on DLP technology from reputable brands, WVGA (480p) resolution and have stylish form factor but M1 was brighter at 250 ANSI Lumens compared to Nebula @ 100 ANSI Lumens and less $.  WiFi would have been nice but it wouldn’t be much use when camping out of range.Overall, resolution and brightness is good enough for watching movies on the go.  Best in darker rooms or at night.  If you want full 1080p resolution at higher lumens, then you’ll have to pay more for a home theater projector which this isn’t positioned to be. M1 comes with two 3W Harman kardon speakers which sound amazing- very impressed with the sound quality!!  We play YouTube and Netflix on Samhain Galaxy S8 connected through USB C.  I think the most clever thing is its product design- the lens cover functions as a stand so you can adjust it in different angles like projecting an image on the ceiling (sounds silly, but our kids love it!).Adding some pics/video to share picture and sound quality.\n', ""\n  We got both the the ViewSonic M1 and the LG  PH550 to see which one would meet our needs better. We ended up going with the LG, but I wanted to leave a quick review about the M1 because it was still a good projector.The M1 fits nicely in the hand. It is a very portable size. It has a nice short throw, meaning a big screen even when close to a wall. It has a lot of automatic features, so you don't have to worry about clicking through a ton of menus to do everything. Auto on/off when the stand is opened/closed, auto image adjust as you change the projector orientation, auto input selection, etc. The speakers are one of the standout features on the M1. They have really good sound that fills the room. No need for a separate speaker unless you want to feel the thunder of a powerful system. The stand is well designed and really makes it easy to position the projector how you want it.So why did we go with the LG? In the end, the LG had better brightness and resolution than the M1, although at $100 more it should right?! We figured that we could make up for lower quality speakers with other solutions, but we couldn't make up for the image difference. We needed to be able to make out finer details, like little words and such, so the LG was a better fit, but we were impressed with the M1 so much that we wanted to give it a shout-out as a good projector at a good price. You will just need a darker room to bring out the best in it.\n"", ""\n  Trying hard to like this projector.  Having major issues with remote not working.  Picture quality is fair. Can't seem to adjust picture settings since remote is glichy. Very annoying. Also hard to adjust picture settings if there is no picture! Seems like a dumb design for picture settings. How do you know if you have the right brightness or contrast if all you can see is the setting menu,?? Since you watch in darkness not having a backlit remote is also a minus. Sound quality and build is good. Compact Design is nice.  Color and contrast not so good.  I dunno... Hoped for better.Changed batteries twice. No luck. Even the fire stick remote is off so I suspect it's the device  and not the actual remote that has..device is going back. Too bad.\n"", '\n  Really blew me away. I was expecting just a dinky little projector for my kids to use in their room but man, I think I might have to reclaim this as my own!The brightness on this thing is far far better than all of the ""easy-bake oven"" toy projectors that Amazon seems to be selling these days. I\'ve been duped by a few of those ~$80 toy projectors in the hope that they would be good enough for y kids. This is easily 10x better! During the afternoon, we just have to draw the window shades and they get a bright ~60"" inch screen from their beds!The sound on this thing is super impressive as well. Reminds me of the little circle UE bluetooth speaker I have; super solid. This is a strong contender for some Xmas gifts this year!\n', ""\n  Works as advertised. I'm using it for both iPad and MacBook projection. I bought the Apple Lightening to HDMI adapter separately to connect the iPad. The projector came with the usb-c to usb-c cable for the MacBook. I tested both connections watching a movie on Netflix and slide shows with Photos, which I what i bought it for. The sound quality is great too, considering the size. Exactly what i hoped for with the H-K speaker setup.\n"", '\n  Awesome product for traveling on business.  I love the flexibility on the angles & distances I can display my presentations.  Pretty solid speakers & brightness for such small projector.\n', ""\n  The Viewsonic M1 is a pretty good all-in-one package and it isn't difficult to list a number of its great features.1. The picture is generally very good. It is sharp and in good focus across the screen.2. Image brightness and colour seem to be very uniform across the image.3. A lot of image adjustments are available, some on-screen (i.e. the image can be adjusted while watching: colour, hue, sharpness and 3-d functions only).4. The on-board sound is convincing and loud enough for me. No need for additional speakers.5. The rotating stand works very well and is quite stable even with cables attached. It holds the projector at any angle without slipping, is easily and rapidly adjustable and allows a lot of versatility in where to project (including the ceiling). It does rely on standing on a level surface, but there is a tripod mount where this is difficult. Amongst othe places, I've had it stood stably on a cushion tray at the end of the bed. The auto turn on/off when the stand is rotated is a neat feature.6. Rapid set-up is helped by the automatic keystone, which works very well.7. The battery life between charges is long. The claimed six hours in battery saving mode seems about right and you can get through a movie at high brightness levels. The battery also charges while projecting; some don't. The battery is a boon in such a portable package but also a possible drawback as it could well limit the device life. It is not user-replaceable and might not be cost-effective to return for service replacement, even if this is possible. Unfortunately, the specifications don't give any idea of the life-expectancy of the battery, possibly understandably as it might depend on how it is used. It is worth asking yourself whether you really need this level of self-contained operation - it is surprisingly useful though.8. There is a useful charge level indicator on the back of the device.9. The USB port can power a Fire stick or other streaming device (drawing up to 1 amp), even in battery mode, making a self-contained streaming unit.10. The cooling fan noise is very subdued. It is inaudible to me until the unit is about foot from my ear, and my hearing isn't particularly poor.11. The remote sensor is on the front of the device and responds well when the remote is directed at the projection screen, rather than the projector, at least at the distances where this short-throw projector is likely to be used. This is much more practical and flexible than having the sensor on the back where cables get in the way of the beam. The remote works well and is reasonably ergonomic.12. There is a good array of modern inputs, including USB-C.13. You get some useful items in the box: a soft case and USB-C cable.14. There is a native Office suite on-board, with functions like scrolling and slide movement via the remote. The projector is bright enough to make a 40-60 inch presentation in subdued light, i.e. in enough light to take notes by, rather than in total darkness. Total darkness is best for films and TV though (unless you are happy with a very small screen).15. Given that the device can easily be picked up and waved about the automatic lamp shutoff could be quite useful. The projector could also be used at close quarters for (say) tracing artwork where the shutoff could save your eyesight - or possibly be a little annoying depending on how close to your hand or surrounding surfaces get to the sensor. In this case, there is an option to suspend auto-shutoff.16. The construction seems high quality. It is reassuringly solid.17. It is backed by a reputable company with a support team and a 2-year warranty, though for some reason this is a year less than that in the US. The product is firmware upgradeable by a not-too-difficult process should any further upgrades be made.18. The instructions say it is 3-d compatible. I've put this last as I probably won't use it.Doubtless there are other features that I have not yet noticed. The projector may be one of the higher priced WVGA offerings, but it is a solid, chic-looking all-in-one solution. That being said there are bound to be compromises in putting such a package together. The following are some acceptable compromises (or non-essential improvements).1. The device really could do with brightness and contrast controls in the on-screen display (OSD). You can control hue, sharpness and saturation from the OSD while watching video. Adding brightness/contrast would be very useful a device such as this. The reason is that ambient light affects the picture a lot and you end up wanting to adjust these more often than on a normal TV. It is a real hassle to have get out of the video, get into menu mode, guess what brightness and contrast are needed (a tonal panel at the bottom left helps a bit), get out of the menus, back into video … and then repeat the process if it not quite right. There are also three ways of adjusting brightness, which introduces further complication here.2. There is a faint circle of stray light well outside the picture area. I think that it is scatter from the case around the lens. Baffling this area might help – but then it would not look so chic. It isn’t a problem really.3. The focus wheel is quite sensitive; a millimetre or so can take it off focus. This appears to be a common issue with the small focus wheels on portable devices. I didn't have any problems but perhaps not easy for those with slight unsteadiness.4. The PowerPoint version installed is not 100% compatible so you don’t always see what was originally generated on a PC. Native PowerPoint is a handy feature though, and the occasional reformatting is easy to work round by suitable preparation and rehearsal. There may be compatibility issue with the other Office packages - I haven't checked. But it is certainly better to have them than not.5. As with all DLP projectors with a single DMD chip, there are sometimes rainbow artifacts if you are sensitive to them (I am, but many are not). It is difficult to get away from this.6. Because the projector is at its best in the dark, an illuminated remote would be useful. You eventually memorise which buttons are which, and fortunately the OSD button is the big one in the middle, but there is some frustration beforehand.7. There is a headphone socket but no on-board Bluetooth for remote audio. However, the on-board speakers are very good and remote speakers can be connected, if desired, via the Bluetooth on any attached streaming device (e.g. Firestick).8. Though it handles all sorts of inputs, the native resolution of this device is WVGA (854 x 480). However, the picture quality is very good and, apart from a very few instances, I can't say that I have noticed the lack of higher resolution.There are also a couple of compromises that take a bit more getting used to (for me, anyway).1. Projected images are surrounded by a light outer frame (a few inches in width on a 50 inch picture) that makes it look like you are watching a TV with a greyish bezel as shown in the attached screenshot. This frame does not keystone with the picture, with the result that at moderate tilts you have the appearance of watching a movie/TV show on a large trapezoidal TV set. It is particularly noticeable during dark scenes, such as the example; the light ones tend to swamp with light reflected round the room it or at least focus attention back to the rectangular movie area. Projecting onto a screen sized to the picture area, rather than a wall, would remove or alleviate this, and it can also be made less noticeable in some circumstances by setting an appropriate picture brightness. I'm told that this frame is an unavoidable side-effect of the DMD chip in DLP projectors, but it is the first time I've noticed it. I have another, otherwise inferior, portable that does not show it.2. Despite the claimed contrast ratio, shadow detail is not great. For example, the dark scenes in Sweeney Todd (and it is mostly dark scenes) weren't handled particularly well no matter what adjustments I made. Darks are difficult for projectors, but it is possible to do a bit better in a portable format.Notwithstanding these issues, if you want something to watch the football at night on a big screen or give presentations to small groups in subdued lighting, with the convenience of needing no mains power, then you've come to the right place.\n"", '\n  Ich suche seit langem einen Beamer, den ich einfach in der Tasche mitnehmen kann , um damit mal unkompliziert präsentieren kann. Vision war immer, im Café vom Telefon mal kurz auf dem Tisch etwas vom Telefon zeigen zu können.Rein von den technischen Daten war das hier die eierlegende Wollmilchsau mit Akku, USB-C und HDMI sowie Steckkarten und USB. Die Lautsprecher-Partnerschaft beeindruckt mich wenig und war auch nicht wichtig für mich.Das Design ist chic. Die Lösung mit dem Ständer, der eingeklappt das Objektiv schützt ist toll.

Lichtqualität hat mich positiv überrascht, allerdings sollte man bei dieser Größe und dem Preis keinen Konferenzbeamer erwarten.Nun zu den Störfaktoren:Ich habe kein einzige USB-C Gerät dazu überreden können, etwas an den Beamer zu liefern. Weder Laptop noch Tablet oder Telefon senden ein Signal erfolgreich an das Gerät. Meine Anfrage beim Support wurde retourniert mit einer Liste kompatibler Geräte. Mein sehr weit verbreitetes Huawei Telefon und mein 1 Jahr alter Lenovo Laptop waren nicht dabei. Ich verstehe die Idee eines Standards anscheinend falsch, aber das ist Humbug, wenn absolute Standardgeräte nicht funktionieren. Mein Telefon schliesse ich also per HDMI Adapter an, was totaler murks ist, aber immerhin eine Lösung.Ich habe eine Speicherkarte eingesteckt und diese wurde nicht gelesen. Verschiedene USB Sticks konnten ebenso wenig gelesen werden. Ich habe von Fat auf NTFS formatiert und umgekehrt und bisher ohne Erfolg.Die Idee den internen (kleinen) Speicher zu nutzen fand ich charmant. Nur wie kann ich Daten überspielen, wenn die Schnittstelle sich nicht ansprechen lassen?Als Ladegerät liegt ein eigenes Netzteil mit einem eigenen Stecker bei. Schade. Hätte man sich hier mal auf USB-C zum Laden eingelassen, wäre das ein echter Mobilitätsvorteil.Also: Ich habe jetzt einen kleinen Beamer der so funktioniert, wie meine bisherigen Geräte. Mit viel Kabelsalat. Ich werde ihn behalten, da es dennoch ein hochqualitatives Gerät mit schönem Design ist. Wer allerdings wie ich auf die USB-C Schnittstelle starke Hoffnung gesetzt hatte, der wird wohl enttäuscht werden.Ansonsten liegt eine kleine ganz nette Tasche und eine Fernbedienung bei. Die Tasche ist so genau geschneidert, dass die Fernbedienung schon nicht mehr dazu passt. Aber das machen andere auch nicht besser.Ich hoffe auf Firmware Updates, die das Kompatibilitätsproblem lösen. Wie ich das dann aber eingespielt bekomme ist mir derzeit noch ein Rätsel.Ich bin nach wie vor enttäuscht, dass das Ding eigentlich nicht wirklich per USB-C klappt, sondern nur mit besonderen Geräten. Ich habe jetzt einen Adapter von USB-C auf HDMI gekauft und das kann ja eigentlich nicht der Sinn der Sache sein.\n', ""\n  Rule no.1 do your research. Get a balanced view of the product. Very few things are perfect. The closer they get to perfection the more they will cost. If it is cheap ask why?My 2 downsides for this projector are resolution and lumens.Once you know and accept this you will be amazed by the value this offering presents.The 2 negatives may seem a deal breaker but this was my approach.Resolution is low. Not HD. HD is incredible but I feel when the movie is rolling and the action commences there is no time to count pixels. Pixels are really noticeable when movie is paused.Lumens. You cannot watch during they datime. This projector performs better the darker it is. You need to block out the light. Once you know and understand this and take measure (bloack out curtains etc.) The problem no longer exists. Sit back enjoy movie/tv.Where else can you get 100 inch movie for this price. The sound delivery is excellent from Harmon Kardon. We don't have a massive lounge.It's portability because of inbuilt battery is another huge plus for us.Our first one stopped working within 14 days which was concerning. Amazon replaced in 2 days so cannot get much better service than that. They said this was first faulty return. Fingerscrossed our replacement lives strong. I would not want to lose it. We don't have a TV which frees up space in the lounge area.Tv's tend to go on just for the sake of it. Projectors do require a bit of set up.That's all folks...\n"", '\n  Nach mehrmaliger Präsentation mit dem Projektor war ich einfach begeistert, es funktionierte alles einwandfrei, der USB Stick wurde erkannt, also alles bestens. Nun hate ich eine Zeremonie (Beerdigung) und in einer Bilderschau sollte das Leben und Wirken des verstorbenen gezeigt werden. Also alles auf einen Stick geladen, zu Hause noch mal getestet, es funktionierte einwandfrei.Nun kommen wir zur Peinlichkeit in ihrer Perfektion, 150 Trauergäste warten auf die Präsentation, aber es passiert nichts, der Stick wird nicht mehr erkannt. Zum Glück hatte ich die Daten auf einem Reserve-Stick, also diesen hineingesteckt in meinen schönen Projektor, aber es passierte wieder nichts.Ich habe immer nur eine Chance, und in diesem Fall eine glatte Peinlichkeit und Blamage, von der Enttäuschung der Angehörigen ganz zu schweigen.Wer das Gerät für den professionellen Einsatz benötigt, lieber nicht kaufen.\n', '\n  I did a lot of research before this purchase. Really love this device, and I think it offers a lot for those willing to spend a little more than a cheap portable projector. The speakers really pump out great sound, and I love the portability. Screen quality is pretty good, the contrast makes up for the lack of resolution. It isnt bright enough to watch in full daylight, but fine with the curtains drawn or the lights slightly dimmed. Overall very happy with the purchase.The only cons I have encountered so far:- over time, the arm seems to have sagged. My picture is now crooked if I am projecting straight. A bit frustrating, and we always prop it up to get it straight- the fan can be a little loud, sort of like a 10 year old laptop running its fan on full. The speakers are loud enough to cover this though- the dial on the side for the focus occasionally unfocuses after a little bit. Can be annoying\n']"
