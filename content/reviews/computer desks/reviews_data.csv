The box arrived in great condition, all the wooden pieces nicely wrapped, with plastic protectors on the desktop’s corners to protect them. All of the various bolts came with one extra. My one gripe, none of the pieces were labeled so I spent 15 minutes sorting everything by the pictures. If you’re good at assembling flat pack furniture, you’ll be fine. If not, you might struggle. The plastic feet on the desk are adjustable, so if your floor isn’t level, make sure you adjust the feet.\n', '\n  Needed a small desk for a child’s room. Arrived with no damage and more bolts than we needed for assembly.  This is a perfect small sized desk, and the attached shelves are a plus. The desk is very sturdy.  However, the instruction manual is pitiful. Parts list pictures are so small we needed a magnifying glass to try and tell the legs units apart. Here are some helpful directions. Part E is the table top support, while Part F and H are the little shelf legs, and G is the lone desk leg. Also, part F has two metal tabs sticking out of one side. They support part E when it is attached to the desk top. Also, step one says the “padding iron pieces” should be facing outward. Have no idea what that is, but I think they mean the metal tabs should be facing the desk side when assembled. Hope this helps some. It took us an hour, but it would have taken 30 minutes if the directions had been better. The photo I posted is a shot looking under the desk at the metal tabs. My granddaughter loves this little desk!\n', ""\n  This is a case of getting exactly what you pay for.  For the low cost, this desk is a great value and is nice looking once assembled. The laminate desktop is decent quality, the frame rails could probably use more than a spot weld though and some thicker material.  The desk is plenty sturdy to hold my dual monitor setup, but I wouldn't try to sit or stand on it myself.  The shelf is just about perfect for holding a mid-tower PC case.  Came with extra short and long bolts, but was missing 2 of the medium size bolts.  Fortunately I didn't need them since I planned to put my PC where the middle shelf goes. Could it be better? Definitely, but this desk resolved my new work from situation for a reasonable price.  I think they improved the instructions too, I'm handy, but the manual I got is different/better than the one in some other reviewer pics.  There's also a short video on YouTube from Joiscope on how to assemble this desk.  Being handy, I watched the video and was assemble the desk in less than an hour without needing any further instructions.\n"", '\n  I read some of the reviews before buying so I will address some of the comments that they made. Packaging was great, nothing damaged, and the box could\'ve taken and beating and nothing would have been hurt. The instructions were fine. Is putting furniture together ever fun and exciting? No, it\'s not. You have to pay attention and take your time. If you throw it together..... the final product is going to look thrown together.I think I understand why some of the reviews say the top gets broken when assembling. The directions say if the screw holes don\'t line up well, turn the top around and try again. Also the directions state not to over tighten the top. I didn\'t and nothing moves around. As the furniture settles I might tighten a little but that\'s pretty normal. Also, there is some ""play"" in the top cross bars that hold the top. Let me explain, two bars come together to make a corner, they are held together by a screw, if you tighten the screw when the pieces are not level, the resulting corner will not be level. Then if you put the straight top on a crooked corner piece, it\'s going to break. Make sure that when you tighten, you use your other hand to make sure the corner is where it need to be.The picture shows the 40"". Great for a smaller space with an extra monitor and a bit of storage.\n', '\n  Was able to put this together in under an hour, with just one person. Nice big desktop, and pretty sturdy for the money. It’ll still wiggle a little bit if you knock it real hard, but I’ve moved houses with it, had fat-cats jump on it, and use it daily for work.Super recommend this desk\n', ""\n  This is a wonderful desk. To say it's sturdy would be an understatement. The claims made in the product copy are true. This thing is a ROCK.The 4-star overall rating is because I did have an issue with a piece being improperly manufactured and thus didn't work with the rest of the unit. But, I contacted JOISCOPE via email and they got back to me within 48 hours. And even though supply chains are strained due to COVID-19, a fix is in the works and I am more than pleased with JOISCOPE's efforts to make it right.This is a GREAT desk that is more than sturdy and very handsome to look at. I can confidently recommend this product and the service that backs it.UPDATE: As stated above, a fix was in process at the time of the original review. That fix was received in a timely manner and I can happily give JoiScope a 5-star rating. Great product, great service and great job JoiScope!\n"", ""\n  I bought this desk for my daughter who needed an upgraded work area since all of her college classes are now online.  We were a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but we are pleasantly surprised with this product.  We weren't expecting it to come with two fabric drawers, so that was a nice unexpected bonus.  We do agree that the directions were not clear, but if you have a basic knowledge of putting things together you should be able to assemble it with little to no issues.  Overall, we are very satisfied with our purchase.\n"", ""\n  This desk is suitable to work. My previous computer desk is very unsteable, even a little act would shake it.

It will be my working partner in my bedroom during this time.\n"", '\n  I bought this desk because I work from home. What I liked about it when I saw it online was that it has shelves. Instead of my books and binders being everywhere, I can put them all in one spot. This desk gives me more room than what I had before. I absolutely love this desk. It’s solid, I love the colours and it was pretty easy to assemble. I built it all by myself in a couple of hours. Anyway, I don’t know why I waited so long to get this. I love my new desk.

Look modern and sleek. Only took a bit over 15 minutes to assemble, and instructions were easy to follow, very satisfied with the purchase.\n', '\n  I’ve been meaning to set up my home office for awhile and really needed a corner desk. There were allot of options but didn’t know that these tables can get so expensive. I decided on taking a chance on this one after searching for some time.For the price, I’d say it was a little on the expensive side for what it is but having been able to use it for 2 weeks, I can say with some relief it was well with worth it.The materials all came packed separately but thank goodness the instructions are really easy and straight forward. It caught me off guard because it seemed so easy that I thought I overpaid for cheap quality. But it was the complete opposite.Pros: the table is well sized for a large monitor (32”) in the center and still plenty of space for a 13” MacBook Air on my right side and doing other tasks on my left. Although, from the photos the table looked to be a little bigger, I’m glad it’s the size that it is; anything bigger would have seemed to clunky. It’s the perfect size for something modern and saves space. The table is also very sturdy too. I hate it when cheap tables shake easily or feels very weak. While it looked cheap when I initially unboxed the materials, after putting it together I realized it was made to hold together very strong. I’ve been very happy with itCons: for the price I had hoped the quality came from higher grade materials. The color options could have been better. I prefer gray or something out of the Apple store but it’s growing on me.If you’re saving money but need a study corner desk, this one is a sure winner. Don’t have to break the bank on this on and it has plenty of space to get your work done.\n', '\n  The desk has a nice look and is very functional, but!!First, the build quality of the frame pieces is quite poor.  Several pieces need to be adjusted with a grinder to fit properly.  One piece was off by over 1/4"" and would have left gaps in the desk surface.  Another would piece would not lineup, any of the four holes, without considerable grinding.  It was off square by several degrees.  Even then the welded parts with the threads were not square.  I had go adjust screw holes to get the piece together.The top pieced of the desk are not very heavy.  It is too flimsy with far more flex that I would like in a desk.  It\'s just not a quality piece.  The top of the desk needs added supports to be sturdy.It\'s a nice design, just not good quality.  I would not buy again.\n', '\n  The desk dimensions are (51.2""+51.2"")L*19.7""D, 29.5""H, double desktop. There are 4 small cylindrical woods for connecting 3 pieces desktop, do not forget them before they were joint together. And the round metal for the bottom was set up at the last, otherwise, it may not be easily seamless to make the 3 piece together. It’s useful one!\n', '\n  This is a great desk, especially for the price.Assembly -the instructions recommend you assemble with someone for efficiency, but I was able to assemble the desk by myself in about 30 minutes. The instructions are easy to read.Sturdiness - this is a strong deskThe desk is able to hold my 24 inch monitor, laptop, and tablet. My desk still feels big despite having all these items on it.I would say you get good value for the price of the desk.\n', '\n  Big fan of the desk and the overall design.- Build of the desk is solid, materials do not feel cheap- Design is stylish and modern with plenty of space (2 monitors, keyboard, mouse, fan, printer, knick knacks with room for a workspace still)- Plenty of space underneath for placing your feet/PC. (I would recommend a small stand to keep your PC off the ground)- All the tools to put it together were provided and even had a few extra screws.- Nice to have the option of which side you want to put the shelf on (easily exchangeable too)Nitpick- While the desk boards feel sturdy I wish they were a little thicker.Overall a solid product and a professional presentation.  Cubiker is a company I will look for when ordering my next desk.\n', '\n  The desk fits perfect for my children to do their homework and at the same time use it as a gaming desk.Easily assembled, no missing pieces. My 10 year old son was able to put it together all by himself following the instruction manual.\n', ""\n  My teenage sister received this as a gift for Christmas and it fits perfectly in her room, with her decor and all. She's extremely happy with it. She was able to put this together by herself (we offered to help, but teens, man), so I assume it wasn't difficult. Be warned that the box it HEAVY, so you'll need help to lift it. It didn't come delivered in any sort of hidden packaging either. Just the box the desk is in, so if you're worried about porch pirates or someone seeing what it is, you might wanna plan to hang around the day it's supposed to be delivered.\n""]"

Very easy to setup and very sturdy.  The legs are made of metal/ steel. I can fit my monitor, keyboard, router,  and my gaming PC. Checkout the pics I attached.\n', '\n  I love everything about this product. Package was secure without any damage to the product. Very easy assembly. Took less then 20min to put everything together. Very stable. I was looking for a corner desk but this one is more then perfect for my use. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice urban style computer desk.\n', '\n  I purchased the Black top with black legs 55"" desk from Tribesigns-Way to Origin. The desk is very spacious and came in a VERY large and VERY heavy box. The space across the top of the desk is perfect for my needs; however, the actual height of the desk was not. I am 5\' tall, which means my torso and arms are proportionate to my body; therefore, the desk ended up being way too tall for me.The measurement of the desk from the top surface of the desk to the floor is correct on the website description; however, this fails to mention the supportive metal bars that are underneath the top wood. The metal bars underneath the desk makes the overall height of the desk shorter. I found my thighs brushing up against the metal bars and my arms straining to stay in a raised-shoulder 90 degree angle while sitting. I had to adjust the height of my chair to sit as close to the metal bars as possible in order for my arms to even lay flat on the surface of the desk while doing computer work on the desk. This was very uncomfortable. The actual height of the desk from the floor to the metal bars supporting the top of the desk is 26.5 inches.Lastly, since the desk was shipped using freight shipping, it arrived damaged, like other reviewers have stated. The corners of the desk I received was ripped off and you can see the particle board underneath. For this reason, as well as for the height issue, I returned it. Now, I purchased this from Tribesigns-Way to Origin and although it took them about 2 weeks to process my return request, they refunded me $100 (I paid a total of $129.99 for the desk) without me having to ship the desk back. I ended up donating it to Goodwill instead, which is a good thing as I did not want to deal with the hassle of having to drop this off at UPS since it is a very heavy and large desk. I do want to note that Tribesigns-Way to Origin initially gave me a $70 refund deal and when I gave reasons as to why I was returning the desk, they increased it to $99 until I settled with a $100 refund. Tribesigns-Way to Origin is a little sketchy to deal with when it comes to returns, but at least you get most of your money back.\n', '\n  PERFECT! I have been looking for a decent-sized/spacious desk that is STURDY and \'nice looking\'. I must have saved 50 different desk options weighing pros and cons and reading reviews. And I am beyond pleased with this desk. Easy to put together but also super sturdy. I did have to adjust one of ""leveling feet"", but that is why they are there! This desk is super sleek and nice looking. Of course I could always put a larger desk to use, but this size is what I needed for limited space options in our townhome. And is. If enough for my laptop + second monitor, and free desk space to write/work. Dimensions are provided, and accurate. I especially love the space underneath, giving me plenty of leg room and also space for an under the desk storage cart or shelf if I want some extra shelving/storage. I am so thrilled to have bought an item online that was true to its specs and reviews. And packaged very well, and not-damaged. I was nervous about buying such a large piece of furniture online since it would be such a hassle to return or exchange if it was not quite right; but no need to worry as the piece was exactly what I expected & true to its descriptions.\n', '\n  Great desk.  Very solid and simple. Mounted 2 24 inch monitors and still plenty of room.\n', '\n  First off I will start by saying this a great table for the price. When I was searching for a computer desk I wanted something sturdy and this desk is most definitely solid. I would have no concerns of jumping up and down on it (not that I would ever do that). The packaging was decent, there were some scuff marks on the metal legs and some scratches in the white paint, nothing too bad.. Easy to assembly, the instructions were laughable but honestly they aren\'t even needed, it\'s basic and simple.Like I said before, this is a solid table that will last me a long time and the price was fair (I paid $100 with free shipping!)The cons that I have are the size and the table top material. Even though the description does list the measurements I still thought this would be a decent size desk for my computer and chair. As you can see in the picture my chair looks monsterous in comparison. For what I need, the desk is a bit small but I suppose that\'s my fault because the measurements are listed accurately on this site.My second issue is the textured ""wood"" top on this desk. Obviously that\'s not a real slab of wood but they made it have a wood texture feel and this makes it impossible to write on a piece of paper! I didn\'t expect that, it looks nice cosmetically but don\'t plan to write with a pen and paper on this thing..To finish up:It\'s a solid desk, easy to assemble, will last a long time.Make sure you have an understanding of the dimensions.\n', '\n  This is an excellent desk / table. The table is exactly as described, and the dimensions are as per the description in the sales pitch.The table itself came a day earlier than was estimated, which is a very welcome bonus. The item was very well packaged, with cardboard and foam packaging to protect its contents. After removing from the packaging and reading the instructions I set to work building the desk. The desk didn\'t take long to build and the instructions were fairly clear.What I would recommend for those buying the table now or in the future ensure that when building the legs of the desk  that you make sure you apply the legs to the correct corners as to ensure that when you come to screwing the other parts of the desk in place that they are positioned as they are meant - once you have purchased you will understand what is meant in that sentence although I appreciate I haven\'t made myself very clear. The instructions are clear, but it\'s always best to double check these things.The materials used to build the desk are high quality and once built the table is very sturdy and will support a good deal of weight securely without table wobble seen on many other computer desks. The desk / table top is of a laminated wood finish (in my case black) that is waterproof and cleans easily. The rest of the table is made with painted metal. The paint is thick and although I have not tried taking any tools to it, appears that it would stand up to the daily wear of a computer desk. I have sitting on my desk a 24"" monitor, a large desktop case, mouse and keyboard. I still have plenty room to have other paperwork and computer accessories.For the exceedingly good price paid for this item, around £56 at the time of buying I would highly recommend this as a desk for a computer - or just as a high quality desk / table in general. It is of strong, great quality, the delivery was fast and building it easy enough if you have limited DIY skills.\n', ""\n  Using the desk for my 3D printer and model making / painting. The desk is just the right size and is very strong and stable. It's also just the right hight to sit at for long periods of time. My printer is quite small, so if you have one of the larger one's then you may want some thing bigger (or just buy two). Overall I would buy this again as it offers very good value for money. The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because it arrived a day or so late and had slight damage to one of the cross beams that support the legs ( a small dent and some paint missing ). This was not aproblem for me, as it will not be seen. The damage must of happent before the desk was packed, as their was no damage to the box. Over all a must buy.\n"", ""\n  Its a very sturdy desk and also simple to put together too. But what i personally didnt like it collects fingerprints. Also my notebook's rubber feet leaving marks all over the desk if i slide it forward/backwards or even if it left in just one place.Edit:Please mind if you buy a desk like this with a glossy black finish, you may have to clean it regularly because of the nature of the product. You gonna have lots of fingerprints and odd streaks on it otherwise in a short amount of time.Its an unwanted thing that comes with the product and you cannot do much anything about it other than cover the desk with a sheet or something.Other than that the product is absolutely fine, sturdy enough, doesnt wobble and heavy enough so it stays in place. I was afraid its gonna be a bit small/low but it matches perfectly with my AKRacing gaming chair.\n"", ""\n  The desk is sturdy and is pretty simple to assemble using a Allen key and some bolts the only down side is that the instructions aren't exactly clear and it wasn't until I had attached two of the legs until I realised that the legs are to be put in a specific order. This might be my own incompetence but I found it slightly annoying but not really a problem hence the good review.\n"", ""\n  looks wise this is a nice desk, easy to clean and looks fairly modern. My only bad thing I can mention is that it creaks a lot. Any slight movement of the desk and you will get a metal creak from the legs. This doesn't bother me personally but I know some people that wouldn't buy it for this reason so just a heads up. My desk has taken a few knocks as well but you couldn't tell as it doesn't seem to dent easily. Looks great when you clean it and keep minimal stuff on it.\n""]"

I have it set up in the corner of my spare bedroom, and it fits the area nicely.  I was able to place my computer on the middle section of the desk, which works beautifully for my needs.  This desk does not have a slide-out keyboard tray, which I don’t mind. You won’t miss the slide-out keyboard tray at all if you’re using this desk with a laptop, anyway. I am using it with a desktop, but I prefer to have the keyboard up higher anyway, so that my wrists aren’t bent at awkward angles.There was a warning label on the middle section of the desk which states that the device isn’t meant to hold more than 25 pounds. I am not sure if the sticker meant just the middle section of the desk, or the entire thing, but my most reasonable guess would be the entire thing. The 25 pound limitation is of no consequence to me; the desk holds my computer monitor, a desk organizer with many pens, etc., file dividers, and a laminator, and some other miscellaneous office supplies, just fine. It can be slightly shaky if I accidently roll into the side of the desk with my office chair, if I type too vigorously, there can be slight vibration. The desk isn’t solid oak, it’s a metal frame with a tempered glass top.I don’t think that I would place a printer on this desk, however, unless you can be certain that it won’t exceed the weight limitations.One thing I noted is that there are no suction cups to secure the tempered glass in the middle section of the desk.  Both of the sides have the suction cups to secure the tempered glass, but for whatever reason, the corner middle section does not. The glass does fit somewhat securely; however, when we tilted the desk on its side to move it into its permanent location, the corner section of glass did tumble out of the desk and land on my laminate flooring. I am very relieved that it did not break.I am rather pleased with this desk. Suits my needs fine, quite an upgrade from my old desk. Would recommend to anyone who needs a reasonably priced desk to fit in a relatively small area, for less than 25 pounds of items.Regarding the label on the glass in the center section, I was able to peel the label off relatively easily, from one corner. Some of the label did remain once I peeled the majority of it off, but I just used an alcohol pad to finish breaking down the adhesive and cleaning the gunk off the area.I hope this review was useful to anyone considering this desk. I have included some photos so that you can see the desk in action!Please click ""helpful"" if you found this review to be helpful.\n', '\n  The instructions were very clear which made the desk really easy to assemble. It also fits perfectly in the corner of my bedroom. I read that the weight was 50lbs so I shouldn’t have any problems with dual monitors. I’m only giving it 4 stars because one of the legs had rust on the corner so I’m not sure what happened there. Other than that, I think it’s a nice desk.\n', ""\n  Just got this on the mail today and writing this review based on ease of putting it together as well as the prompt customer service I received.My son and I put this together in about 10-15 minutes. It fits great in his room and looks great. Time will tell how wear and tear work with this.We couldn't find the screw kit that comes with it. After 30 minutes of going through the box multiple times I called the customer service # and was sent to a voicemail. I left a message explaining what was missing and requesting an immediate return call (I was a little pissed). My son went through everything 1 last time and found the screws tapes to some of the packaging. That's when we started putting it together. 10 minutes later they called back and this was after 6pm. The man was very kind and helpful.That man is the reason I'm giving this 5 stars.\n"", '\n  Pros: The price for a solid quality desk. Looks amazing. Very sturdy, no wobble at all. Very easy assembly ""45 minutes"". Only 2 different size screws, so impossible not be able to figure out how to assemble it. Great pictured instructions.Cons: Horrible chemical smell when I opened the box. I think it was from the styrofoam. Once the packaging was thrown out the smell was gone. The two large glass sections bolt down with 4 short screws. 2 screws on one of the glass sections would not thread in far enough to secure the glass to the frame. This gave a little wobble and noise. The fix was easy, I  used a washer between the screw and bracket and it was able to securely tighten, Besides those two things I still give this desk 5 stars.Overall: I am extremely happy with this purchase and would highly recommend the desk. One thing I thought from the pictures is that the black glass was just a dark tint and you would be able to see through it. Well you can\'t, it has a incredible looking black finish. Also my optical mouse does not work due to the finish, so you will need a mouse pad.\n', ""\n  Could not be happier with my new desk.  Light weight, well packaged. I'm older and able to lift it. Assembles easily - seriously if I can assemble it, anyone can. Little narrower than I need since I like to spread out when I work. However, it is well made, sturdy. I have two large dogs that crawl in and out, and it stays in place. Nice to look at. Great price.\n"", '\n  This desk is very nice. It took less than an hour to assemble. The instructions are easy and straight-forward....just pictures, letters for the parts and numbers to follow. Be careful to follow the instructions of making sure NOT to tighten the screws all the way until you have lightly screwed them all in. Once the screws are in place, then tighten them. Also, be careful with the glass tops. They are thin, but they do feel of good quality. I bought the desk for my teenage son’s gaming/streaming and he LOVES it. I love it too. I might get one for myself. The price was good for this desk.\n', ""\n  Sturdy enough that it doesn't collapse when my 27 lb. Maine Coon cat jumps up for a head scratch (and is immediately yelled ***DOWN***).  Roomy enough for all the stuff that somehow accumulates over the course of the day.

In other words, I'm very happy -- and comfortable -- with my 'out-of-the-way' corner desk and will not pester you with any complaints for a few years at least.\n""]"

I\'ve been sitting on this rage for a bit so hold onto your butts. First I\'ll extend an olive branch: the desk fits well into anyone\'s budget. At the time (like, 2 weeks ago) I got it for $40. Not bad. It\'s a desk. It does desk things. That\'s about all the good I have to say here.But speaking of the price, I bought it for $40 and as soon as I started assembling this god damn thing I knew I got gypped. The instructions were clear enough. Allegedly the desk should be assembled in roughly 30 minutes if you have someone helping you. My roommates were out so I tackled the project myself, figuring that at most it would take an hour. 4 hours later, I\'m still working on it. Why? Because there were supposed to be holes for all the screws and pegs that were drilled into the wood already, according to the instructions, but I guess the guy who was supposed to do that got drunk on the job because there\'s no holes. I don\'t have tools either. I have one Gerber multi tool and I had to painstakingly ""drill"" my own holes with a broken knife, a now-worn down screwdriver head, and a series of other tool-heads that are now similarly worn. Before you say, ""What\'s the problem, don\'t Gerbers have a lifetime warranty?"" Yeah, it\'s only good for the one replacement. This was it. I paid $80 for the Gerber and $40 for the desk, but now that half the tools in my Gerber are useless, technically I\'m out $120. If the manufacturer is reading this, I accept reimbursement through the Cash App.Speaking of price, as I clicked on this product to file my initial complaint, I found more reasons to get pissed off. The price on this piece of excrement actually JUMPED by $15 in the literally 2 weeks since I bought this. How is the demand rising at all? I feel like it should be plummeting faster than our president\'s approval ratings. I wouldn\'t even buy this again if the price dropped $15. I wouldn\'t even take it for FREE if I knew what I was getting into.Now the sturdiness. It\'s okay. Not great, not terrible, but I\'m a little concerned at how much this thing wiggles just from me lightly typing away on my laptop. The directions say the desk is prorated to hold 15 pounds across the main part of it, but the directions also said the holes were supposed to be pre-drilled so I don\'t know about that. The good news is that if I\'m unlucky enough to fart on this thing and it collapses, the manufacturer owes me a new computer.That\'s right, this desk is so awful that I\'m praying that it breaks for a payout. Maybe I\'ll tack on extra charges for emotional pain and suffering. I could be paying my bills right now. I could be writing that novel I promised I\'d start on once I get a new desk. But instead I\'m putting off my entire life to warn the people of Amazon to not buy this desk.""But Nick! It\'s cheap, you knew what you were getting into!"" Maybe, but it really says something about this economy that I can\'t even save money or else I just end up wasting it. What sick person would charge someone $40 (and then $55.11 before tax and shipping) and then blame them for not throwing down an extra $500 when it blows up in their face? That\'s not how you compete with other businesses. I\'m an English major and I have no skills but I could make a better desk out of cardboard and pubic hairs.Oh and one last thing: the pull out drawer or whatever it\'s called, the thing you put your keyboard on? Flimsier than a tightrope walker with Parkinson\'s. I look at it funny and it just falls off. There\'s nothing holding it together. I\'m not sure if I should add more holes so I can screw it on, but god forbid I finish the manufacturer\'s job.Anyway, my point is don\'t buy this desk. 2/10; I\'m burning this when I find something better.\n', ""\n  I read a lot of negative reviews on this desk about it being flimsy and things breaking, first thing about this is they are probably comparing it to a $500 desk this desk costs under $50 your not going to get a top of the line model for that.  This being said it's a very well made desk for the money very sturdy I was actually impressed how sturdy it was I was planning on reinforcing it once I got it but after setting it up realized I didn't need to.  I keep all my school books and my iMac on it without any issues.  This desk is definitely worth the money.\n"", '\n  So i was back and forth on this purchase but im very happy i made it. It took me about 30 minutes to assemble with relative ease. The instructions are fairly simple to follow but the piece letters can be a little difficult to read. for under 60 dollars its definitely worth the money. You might want to reinforce some areas with some extra tacking nails but other than that this desk is solid. i put a 23"" AIO on the low side and a 24"" smart tv for a second monitor on the the high shelf no problems. i highly recommend this item for small spaces and a small budget.\n', ""\n  For $25 this desk is AWESOME! I honestly don't understand the highly negative reviews. Maybe Furinno made some changes but mine came well packaged with all the hardware bits sealed up in a baggie. Nothing was damaged and all the pieces were labeled.Assembly takes some time but is not difficult to figure out if you have a bit of patience- I used the manual and the amazon video together and had no problem.Once assembled this desk is MUCH sturdier than I expected. Everything is stuck tightly together and seems strong enough to hold a printer/monitor/whatever you like. The only area I had some trouble with was the keyboard tray but I decided not to use it anyway.Overall if you're looking for a place to sit on your computer or to get some work done without taking up a ton of room this is your desk. I did a lot of research before choosing this and i'm glad I did.\n"", ""\n  Its sturdy and worth the money however This is nothing like the colour on the photo so if your buying it like I did toMatch your room furnishings then this is nothing like grey it's a brown oak colour nothing like grey\n"", ""\n  This desk is awesome.It took me a little while to put it together by myself but only because of the amount of pieces and the complexity. I found the instructions to be excellent, so relax!The boards and hardware were well defined, with stickers and not markers as other people have experienced in the past.The design is great, as I'm able to put my printer, books and even my bag nearby. The little cloth drawer is better than I thought. Beside the file cabinet they make a perfect pair.Pros:-Great design and size for my small place.-Reasonably easy to put together, with clear instructions.-Excellent price and value for the money.-Handsome piece! Looks clean and tidy.Cons:-The packaging was poor and flimsy. It's a miracle it came undamaged, especially because Canada Post left it out in the rain and no notification of its arrival :(-The keyboard tray could have been a couple of inches deeper.-It's sturdy enough for my needs. But as I said its good value for the money.All in all I am super happy with this desk. I'd buy it again.\n"", ""\n  Needed to get a smaller desk after moving, but didn't want to spend too much, and after a lot of trawling across the 'net,  this seemed to fit the bill.Seems OK after nearly 2 months, but still getting used to not having anywhere near the space I had with my old one.Would be handy if the shelf on the right hand side was adjustable, as I prefer my PC Base unit on the floor rather than up on the shelf as it has to be in this case.I measured everything carefully to ensure that everything I needed to fit on the desk would fit, and as you can see it does.The material appears to be MDF with a black indeterminate covering, but the covering is VERY thin so will become easily damaged - mine has a couple of scratches already.Each part of the desk is around 12mm thick, so NOT for heavy duty use. I would say ideal for a kid's bedroom (apart from the fact it damages easily) or a small room / office where space is at a premium, but if you have the space, there are better desks out there.**NOTE** The hutch my monitor is standing on in the pic was bought separately and wasn't part of this desk.\n"", ""\n  As the review states, the design of of this desk is excellent. The size is reasonably small, it has multiple layers, it has a place to put your keyboard and mouse under the desk, it has a compartment to put things in. It's pretty great.The concern is the quality of the wood itself, and the paint coming away from the wood so early into its life. There are several areas which have seen quite minor use which have paint pulling away from the wood. Although at this point in its life it is mostly just an aesthetic problem, I am fairly certain that in the not so distant future I am going to need to repaint the wood and possibly varnish it.I would also like to clarify that although it just looks like a surface, cleaning it only adds more white dots, and upon further inspection it is quite self-evident that this is whatever is underneath the paint coming through the top layer of paint.Tl:Dr - This is a well designed but cheap item, the actual quality of the item itself is very poor, however the design is excellent. I'd also add that it was easy to put together alone, although a little time consuming.\n"", ""\n  This was perfect for my sons needs to organise all of his gaming equipment. Don't bother! Instead spend an hour assembling it, feel chuffed with yourself and then for the finishing touches..peel off all the stickers. Only did 2 (and gently) as they also peeled the wood effect off to reveal the cheap ply beneath. Ruined.  Another hour to disassemble and pack up and now need to find the time to take it to the Post Office (it's a 2 person carry). Still they will refund up to £4.75 postage..will probably cost me £15 due to the weight! Son bought it out of his birthday money and is gutted.\n""]"

Look modern and sleek. Only took a bit over 15 minutes to assemble, and instructions were easy to follow, very satisfied with the purchase.\n', '\n  I’ve been meaning to set up my home office for awhile and really needed a corner desk. There were allot of options but didn’t know that these tables can get so expensive. I decided on taking a chance on this one after searching for some time.For the price, I’d say it was a little on the expensive side for what it is but having been able to use it for 2 weeks, I can say with some relief it was well with worth it.The materials all came packed separately but thank goodness the instructions are really easy and straight forward. It caught me off guard because it seemed so easy that I thought I overpaid for cheap quality. But it was the complete opposite.Pros: the table is well sized for a large monitor (32”) in the center and still plenty of space for a 13” MacBook Air on my right side and doing other tasks on my left. Although, from the photos the table looked to be a little bigger, I’m glad it’s the size that it is; anything bigger would have seemed to clunky. It’s the perfect size for something modern and saves space. The table is also very sturdy too. I hate it when cheap tables shake easily or feels very weak. While it looked cheap when I initially unboxed the materials, after putting it together I realized it was made to hold together very strong. I’ve been very happy with itCons: for the price I had hoped the quality came from higher grade materials. The color options could have been better. I prefer gray or something out of the Apple store but it’s growing on me.If you’re saving money but need a study corner desk, this one is a sure winner. Don’t have to break the bank on this on and it has plenty of space to get your work done.\n', '\n  The desk has a nice look and is very functional, but!!First, the build quality of the frame pieces is quite poor.  Several pieces need to be adjusted with a grinder to fit properly.  One piece was off by over 1/4"" and would have left gaps in the desk surface.  Another would piece would not lineup, any of the four holes, without considerable grinding.  It was off square by several degrees.  Even then the welded parts with the threads were not square.  I had go adjust screw holes to get the piece together.The top pieced of the desk are not very heavy.  It is too flimsy with far more flex that I would like in a desk.  It\'s just not a quality piece.  The top of the desk needs added supports to be sturdy.It\'s a nice design, just not good quality.  I would not buy again.\n', '\n  The desk dimensions are (51.2""+51.2"")L*19.7""D, 29.5""H, double desktop. There are 4 small cylindrical woods for connecting 3 pieces desktop, do not forget them before they were joint together. And the round metal for the bottom was set up at the last, otherwise, it may not be easily seamless to make the 3 piece together. It’s useful one!\n', '\n  This is a great desk, especially for the price.Assembly -the instructions recommend you assemble with someone for efficiency, but I was able to assemble the desk by myself in about 30 minutes. The instructions are easy to read.Sturdiness - this is a strong deskThe desk is able to hold my 24 inch monitor, laptop, and tablet. My desk still feels big despite having all these items on it.I would say you get good value for the price of the desk.\n', '\n  Big fan of the desk and the overall design.- Build of the desk is solid, materials do not feel cheap- Design is stylish and modern with plenty of space (2 monitors, keyboard, mouse, fan, printer, knick knacks with room for a workspace still)- Plenty of space underneath for placing your feet/PC. (I would recommend a small stand to keep your PC off the ground)- All the tools to put it together were provided and even had a few extra screws.- Nice to have the option of which side you want to put the shelf on (easily exchangeable too)Nitpick- While the desk boards feel sturdy I wish they were a little thicker.Overall a solid product and a professional presentation.  Cubiker is a company I will look for when ordering my next desk.\n', '\n  The desk fits perfect for my children to do their homework and at the same time use it as a gaming desk.Easily assembled, no missing pieces. My 10 year old son was able to put it together all by himself following the instruction manual.\n', ""\n  My teenage sister received this as a gift for Christmas and it fits perfectly in her room, with her decor and all. She's extremely happy with it. She was able to put this together by herself (we offered to help, but teens, man), so I assume it wasn't difficult. Be warned that the box it HEAVY, so you'll need help to lift it. It didn't come delivered in any sort of hidden packaging either. Just the box the desk is in, so if you're worried about porch pirates or someone seeing what it is, you might wanna plan to hang around the day it's supposed to be delivered.\n""]"

I love the way they design the L shape. Instead of sharp, they make it shapes like a circle so that you have lots of room behind for wires and stuff like that. Overall, it is a good one for the office table, but if you are looking for a gaming table it shouldn't be an option for you in my opinion. It is not as wide enough as the regular gaming table. So if you are looking for an office table, this is the one for you!! I don't know why I cannot post a real picture of what I have set up but anyway, just give it a shot I would say :)\n"", '\n  I’m going to start off with the bad, I received the product defective. As shown in the pictures, there was supposed to be two holes on one side to insert the screws, but it was defective and one hole was on one side and the other on the correct side. I made do, and assembled it just fine after figuring out that the diagram was completely off and did not match ANY parts.I had to use the picture to assemble most of it.I did have trouble aligning the parts since the holes were mostly off or not a perfect fit.The good,It looks very nice assembled. It only wiggles (barely) on the side that is missing the screw. The height is perfect. It’s also long enough to fit my 32 in tv, Xbox and 22in monitor. I wouldn’t recommend using the shelf for the monitor as it would be way to high and a strain on your neck.Cleans good, and once you properly adjust the little caps on the legs, it’s perfectly straight and not wiggly.Had it not been defective and hard to assemble I would give it 4 stars because the quality is good. For a beginner gaming desk.\n', ""\n  I want to let you know that this manual is mostly picture driven and that you may wind up changing up many things before you get it right. My biggest recommendation is to keep everything loose until you know that is is going to work. As for the integrity of the desk there is always going to be one part (pictured above) that does not center correctly no matter how many times you redo it (three for me) I could not get it flush. It does not seem like the kind of desk that will last for years to come.  If you bought this for gaming you probably do not want to use the monitor stand unless you got a cheap LCD like I did and have a little money to throw around. My final thought is that this desk seems more at home in a quiet setting which should help it last longer but you know the old saying caveat emptor (Let the buyer beware for those who don't speak Latin).\n"", '\n  The desk itself is beautiful and very easy to put together. For my personal needs, however, it is way too wobbly and shakes when I type or write. I do not type or write very hard - I believe I am pretty average in those areas. I have the desk placed on carpet and it shakes so much as I am typing this that my coffee is sloshing around in the mug next to the keyboard. The ""levels"" on the legs do not work very well as they are inserted into the legs with cheap plastic. So if you unscrew one or two of them on once of the desk, the corresponding ones on the other side of the desk might not work the same.While measurements are provided in the description of the product, I guess I didn\'t think things through well enough when I was considering purchasing this product. The desk top is so shallow that I simply cannot have my monitor on the desk and still have room for the keyboard and mouse. It is way too close to my eyes. So I had to place a narrow table behind this desk to hold my monitors so I didn\'t blind myself. I feel as though I am still too close to the monitors.I am thinking of using this as a sewing table instead and hopefully the weight of the sewing machine will hold it down from wobbling so much. But it\'s really not worth the effort to uproot everything and then find out it will continue to wobble horribly for the sewing machine, too.I am honestly not sure how to remedy this situation. I can\'t be the only person experiencing this problem. Again, I don\'t type or write that hard. I did not have this problem with the previous desk this replaced. I can\'t remove the carpet from my office just to see if that remedies the situation - but I think no carpet would be worse.I guess it\'s worth the price I paid for it. But I can\'t really use it for anything but sitting and watching movies. I can\'t imagine how a GAMER would be able to use this desk without it shaking all over the place. Unless you play games that don\'t require the keyboard - then i can see how this would be a good desk.I think all of the positive reviews for this encouraged me to purchase it - but I am terribly disappointed. Not worth packing it all back up and try to get a refund. So think about this carefully before you decide to purchase.\n']"
