The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find.  This Chromebook is none of that, the ease of this is like using a smartphone. I have absolutely no problem with the screen resolution , it looks fine to me. I can't comment on the battery life because I've yet to unplug it, I use it strictly as a stay in one place computer (plugged in all the time). Google Docs and files take a little getting used to if you never used them, but once you get used to it you'll have no problem. It was not a problem for me because I was already use them on my iPhone . You can't download outside programs because its a closed system, to me , that's a good thing because I only use it to surf the web, shop, emails and files. And because you can't download programs your not gonna pick up any viruses. If you need to edit any photos you can always download a photo app from the Play store. I've found the storage and speed for this to be just fine, it doesn't seem to slow down with numerous tabs open. You have a load of apps to download from the Google play store that should keep you happy. I don't use it to stream movies or play games so I can't comment on that, I'll streams stuff from YouTube with no problems at all. If you want a laptop to do just the basics like I do, then you can't go wrong with this for the price. To me it's way better then one of those low cost Windows PC's. I had a low end Windows PC that I bought  as a extra computer for me to use when my wife is working on the expensive PC, I hated it so much I gave it away before it was a month old. Besides being intrusive and confusing, it was slow as crap. This Chromebook is like having a giant smartphone with a keyboard, (IT'S THAT EASY). The only reason I took away one star is because I think it could of used one more USB port, other then that I love it, and if you use a computer like I do, you will too.PS. Keep in mind that this model S330 comes in different specs. My review is based on the model with the higher resolution screen  (1920 x 1080) and more memory (64gb). They have a cheaper model called the S330 with less resolution and less memory.\n"", ""\n  The FHD (1920x1080p) version of the Lenovo S330 definitely does NOT have an IPS display. The panel is reminiscent of what you'd see on a Windows XP era laptop. No matter what angle you choose, it looks washed out. Some colors are so undersaturated that it's hard to see gradients.Lenovo's decision to put a non-IPS display on the S330 is baffling. It's a real shame too, because otherwise, the S330 is a very nice Chromebook for the price. The keyboard feels great, the trackpad has an amazing texture, and overall the build quality is quite good. However, without an IPS display, it's a new car with an engine from the 1970's. It'll work...but why?\n"", ""\n  ... you receive a written promise from Lenovo quality control that they'll pay YOU for the time you'll need to spend doing their job for them. I've had this Lenovo Chromebook for just a few days, and already I've spent too much time restarting it. On the same day it arrived, it began to freeze and turn off. Repeatedly. I ran powerwash several times. Same issue.The value proposition for this Chromebook is that you can simply open the box, and get started working, hassle-free.  Value has not been delivered. If I wanted this much aggravation, I'd run one of my old Dell's with Vista.UPDATE: 4/23. Ran powerwash two more times. Spoke with Amazon. Spoke with Lenovo. Ran complete recovery of Chrome OS. Still freezes and crashes. Just ordered a second one for arrival 4/23, and am returning this one. Perhaps this one is just a lemon. If the second machine works as it should, I'll update here. If it doesn't, I'll return it also and post a second review. Total time wasted so far: 12 hours and counting.\n"", ""\n  I was nervous about ordering this Chromebook many months before arrival. It was a Christmas gift for my husband. However, it arrived as scheduled in great condition. We had been looking for an affordable Chromebook of good quality for watching videos, browsing the internet and using google documents. The battery life is awesome and the resolution is great. He's been using it since December and is very happy with it. Would recommend!\n"", ""\n  This Chromebook is solidly in the lower middle of the pack, so don't get it.  Either go for the cheaper ASUS ruggadized models, or go more expensive for models with touchscreen and a real processor, but don't get this one.  Way too slow.  You can't watch any type of TV streaming on it, it's so laggy it hurts.\n"", '\n  bueno que les puedo decir lo bueno: tenia mis dudas si era usada, pero no llego en su empaque nueva, sin nigun rayon, bien sellada, contiene cable cargador, el inicio y configuracion es relativamente rapido mas que con una windows, la relacion precio calidad es execelnte, se ve que es resistente el material, no se traba, ojo todo es online sobre el drive de google, pero bueno si ya guardabas todo en la nube no hay problema sincronizas tus archivos y los llevas a todos lados aun sin el equipo, el teclado no tiene la tecla para ñ, pero la tecla de : funciona como si lo fuera con naturalidad, tiene muchas funciones el display, lo siento muy limpio, justamente escribo la reseña desde la unidad, la recomiendo mucho. lo MALO pues hasta el momento nada.

It checks a lot of boxes and I've done my fair share of research.1. Solid build. Nice sturdy plastic chassis. (Keeps it lightweight)2. USB type C port, SD card slot, HDMI, and USB 3.03. Touchscreen with an IPS display4. 4 gigs of RAM and 64gig of storage. (rare at this price point)5. Nice feel to the keyboard and track pad.6. ARM processor that is optimized for the Google play store apps and runs much better than the Intel celerons you see in most low-end Chromebooks.You get a lot for $300. You can't really find those options within that price range. The only thing I wish it had was a FHD display. 1366x768 still looks sharp on an 11.6 in screen but it would be super sharp if it was 1080p. I would highly recommend this Chromebook.\n"", '\n  Over the period of 30-60 seconds after unboxing it for the first time.1. Turn on2. Sign in with your Google account.3. Select wifi network.That\'s it, everything is set up, all your Google pictures, mail, bookmarks (from your Android phone, assuming you use chrome on mobile) is all there.I\'m used to spending at least a few hours setting up, updating, uninstalling bloatware, denying ""trial offers"" on Windows PCs. Nothing on this.Literally ready for use within a minute.Windows®, take notes.\n', ""\n  Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.\n"", '\n  Do NOT buy this if you will need to download apps as the Google Play Store app can’t be downloaded on this chrome book. Internet and everything else works fine, but I bought this for my kids to play Roblox and other apps, but this particular chrome book won’t allow the Google Play store.I had no idea that it was even possible for the Google App Store not to be compatible with a Google Chrome Book!\n', ""\n  Brand new device, went from 64gb out the box and after the OS update i only have 49GB available. 3.7G are in use by preinstalled apps. So you can subtract at least 15GB from the advertised 64GB description. That said, if you buy the 32GB you'll be severely disappointed.\n"", ""\n  Chromebook prices range from around $100 to over $1000. Better Chromebooks have Intel Core CPUs for great performance. The much cheaper Mediatek system in this Chromebook gives it mediocre performance, especially for intensive games or for business users who open lots of tabs simultaneously and frequently switch between them. On the plus side this Chromebook has a useful 4GB of RAM, a sharp colorful IPS screen, a touch screen that works great with Android apps, a very responsive (for swiping) touchpad, and reliable WiFi (much better than my HP laptop). On the minus side, the white plastic shell looks and feels a little cheap, the screen is not very bright, and the touchpad's button feels a little clunky. In summary, if you can't afford more than $300, this is a good choice for casual users who only have a few tabs open at once and use it mostly for email, Facebook, web surfing, and streaming music or videos. If you can afford $350 to $400, you will have several choices with more powerful CPUs for more intensive users.\n"", '\n  I am extremely impressed with this unit. Great price, and it works really well. Nicely designed, sturdy, the keyboard and trackpad are decent. Touchscreen works well. I would highly recommend it. One thing is incorrectly described in the specifications - it says there is a microSD card slot. It is actually a SD slot. I bought a microSD card hoping to put it in and have added storage space on the go, but an SD card sticks out a lot.\n', ""\n  I've been doing research on Chromebooks as my Macbook Pro Retina (2013) recently died. I needed something portable, fast, cheap ($300-400 CAD) and easy to use for multimedia / work / documents.After looking through Lenovo's different options, I decided to pick up the Lenovo S330. The S330 was great, nice bezels, sturdy and an okay screen... But the screen had really bad viewing angles and didn't have a touch-screen.So I decided to return the S330 and purchase the C330.... WOW, BIG DIFFERENCE. The touch-screen, smaller form factor and overall look just BLEW me away. I didn't think that I'd use the touch-screen that much, however, chromebooks are OPTIMIZED for touch-screens.Overall, for under $400, I would highly recommend getting the C330 instead of the S330.\n"", ""\n  I bought S330 from bestbuy.  They don't have the 64g version.  I brought it home. Although it was working fine, but I am used to having a touch screen on my device, and it doesnt completely fold like a tablet.  Then, I saw  C330 on amazon.  What makes it amazing, is that, for a few more dollars,  I can get a touchsceen, ips display and a 64gb version.  I have an adroid phone, and all programs from my adroid phone are easily downloaded to this device, easily, which would be a pain, if you have a windows 10 operating system.  Also the battery life is incredible.  I only use it at home when I am in front of my tv.  And it would last for days without recharging it.  On top of it,  I could easily cast anything on my tv.  I have a 75 inch 4k uhd and i attached a chromecast ultra.  Casting is a breeze.  No issues whatsover.  I don't give out reviews often, but this is one of those, that I need to give my opinion.  I am extremely happy with this laptop.  It's the best for its price!!! Every penny is worth it.  On a different note, I had some issues with amazon.ca.  Please contact them on phone.  Nothing has been resolved on online chat.  I had to talk to two agents online, but nothing happened.  Over the phone,  it was quickly resolved.  Overall, I am super happy the my purchase and super happy with amazon.  That's why I am keeping my prime membership and cancelling my netflix.\n"", ""\n  The specs are everything I expected, except the weight, which is 2.9 lbs. and not 2.6 lbs. The screen is small compared to the size of the panel, with 2.5 cm of border all a around (5 cm at the bottom). It will only connect to a Bluetooth speaker immediately after rebooting for some reason, and with one of my speakers the volume cannot be changed. Sometimes the mouse disappears when over a mobile app. And after 40 days, it's suddenly not accepting a charge without a reboot. There is no cap locks key. Although it claims to support SMB file shares, it doesn't seem to be compatible with any of the computers in my house. WiFi just crawls unless I switch to 5GHz. The more I use this, the more I regret buying it.Then there are the problems with Chromebooks. Some apps act like they are for computers, others like they are for smartphones. Sometimes you get an X button to close a window. Sometimes you get a back button (that might close your window, too). Any consistency is completely out the window.It is pretty cool (and freaky) how it knows all my passwords saved in Chrome browser on PC. At least set up is a snap. The screen is powerful, sharp, and has a wonderful viewing angle.\n"", ""\n  This product has exceeded my expectations.  The touch screen is fantastic, it's light, portable, the battery lasts forever.  The only slight downsides are as follows: 1. the display is much smaller than the size of the machine, they could have either made the machine smaller or the screen larger.  We don't need the huge border 2. the chromebook takes a bit of getting used to when coming from a windows or mac computer, but that's not an issue with the machine, just something to note when buying 3. the camera is kind of cheap, but then again that's not what is was made for 4. the camera is only front facing, so you can't use it to take pictures of things as you look at the screen, but again that's not what the machine was meant for.Back to the pros, my family found that it looked amazing, the keyboard is great, it is super fast, can load android apps, wifi works perfectly, really excellent machine!\n"", '\n  I wanted a 2-in-1 tablet/laptop hybrid and at 11 inches it is portable enough to travel and leave my tablet and laptop at home.  The HDMI is great for attaching to TVs for personal content viewing.  I do not like that the SD card sticks out by 50% meaning it can not be inserted full time lest it snag.  The white durable case is great but a bit sharp on front edge on your hands and tummy.  The 64 GB storage is a plus given most chromebooks only have 16 or 32 GB and loading apps consumes a few to several GB to start. Recommended\n']"

I was very excited about the prospect of an updated version of the chromebook and when I saw that it had 6 GB of ram—I had high hopes of this being the perfect compromise between its shortcomings (aesthetics and screen size) to gain the advantages that I wanted (speed and weight). I am a college professor who uses the chromebook as a secondary machine to browse the web, manage emails, and watch videos on Youtube. While I do these things I also use a small combination of android productivity apps, either Pandora or Spotify playing in the background, and 8-12 tabs open at once. In the spectrum of chrome users, I believe I am representative of the basic or moderate level consumer. I am familiar with the operating system and have fair expectations of what a chromebook can and can’t do, but I am not a power user and do not push the system with external monitors, complicated apps, or use linux.Pros1. Speed: This chromebook utilizes the Celeron N4000 processor and 6 gb of ram. I really think that anyone who hasn’t had a chromebook or hasn’t updated in a while will be happy if they find a machine that uses the N4000 processor. Although it is only a dual-core Celeron processor that doesn’t wow you with its base speed, it has a 4 mb cache. Most of the processors in budget machines in the past generations had 1-2 mb caches at most. This change is one that you actually feel when using the chromebook because this will increase the pace of things I believe most users like such as: switching between tabs, quickly loading pages, and multitasking. The 6 gb of ram is a unique selling point and a really excellent choice by Samsung. Chromebooks usually come in two ram options 4 gb vs. 8 gb with the 8 gb units typically much rarer and unavailable as an upgrade on many units. While they run perfectly well on 4 gb, the 6 gb is a comfortable upgrade. It is impossible for me to isolate how much of the buttery smooth speed of the machine is due to the processor or due to the extra 2 gb of ram from the norm, but the combination makes for a wonderful user experience.2. Size: The weight of the machine and the form factor are very satisfying. This device adds very little weight to your bag while traveling and for walks across campus, that lighter frame is much appreciated. I enjoy the fact that despite being so light that it does not feel overly cheap; it’s far sturdier than one would expect for a cheap and light device. Overall, for anyone who enjoys the lightweight portability provided by an 11.6 inch machine—this one fits the bill while feeling substantial enough that it avoids feeling flimsy.Con:Screen: This is the first time that I can say that on a machine that I otherwise enjoyed that there was a single feature that could be a deal-breaker, but the screen is genuinely that bad. It isn’t because of the resolution because most chromebooks, especially in the budget range and at 11.6 inch screen size, all have the same resolution. It also isn’t because it is a TN panel because the Samsung Chromebook 3 had a manageable TN panel that didn’t break its usability. This panel is just wretched. It has ridiculously specific viewing angles. If you don’t hit it spot on with your eyes then colors wash out and text gets blurry at the top or bottom of the screen. It’s so grainy, washed out, and pixelated that it unfits the device for almost all of my primary needs. The brightness even seems less than the Samsung Chromebook 3. I am just flabbergasted that they selected such a bad panel that feels like a step back from their best-selling previous model. The screen was literally so bad I wondered if I had a defective model, but my experience seems consistent with the limited reviews available for this machine.ConclusionThis machine was one that I wanted to love and everything that I saw on paper that I believed I would like—I did. The speed is there and the 6 gb of ram cannot be undersold as an excellent choice by Samsung, so I was happy about that. The keyboard was serviceable, which I expected and would have been satisfied with if it hadn’t been for the screen. The screen is just unacceptable at any price point. The speed and smooth operation cannot offset the quality of the panel being used here. You look at the screen for everything you do unless you are using an external monitor and this one is almost guaranteed to give you eyestrain and become an irritating chore to constantly rework the angle of your eyes to the screen and the angle of the screen on the hinge. In my opinion it just isn’t worth it. This might sound like I am overly critical or I am knocking the machine too much for one issue, but an otherwise spectacular experience can, indeed, be ruined if one of the key components used is as bad as this screen. Showroom this model against alternative 11.6 inch chromebooks and you will see what I mean. Don’t select nicer models, IPS screens, or more expensive models; put it side-by-side with other budget TN options and you will see that at the same resolution and same size that the numbers lie and this screen is simply worse than the alternatives. Despite my desire to love it and the excellent choices made my Samsung for the processor and ram combo, the screen panel choice outweighs those good choices and destroys the quality of the final product.\n', '\n  I bought the 6 GB ram model directly from Samsung.  If the screen was better this would be five stars.  Good build quality and the little details seemed to be well done.  The screen though makes this useless.  The screen is highly directional.  Slight movement causes the screen to changebrightnesss level to such a degree that it results in eye strain.  This happened with just the slight movement from resting it on my lap and trying to work on it.  Even when viewed from the best angle the text appears fuzzy and shadowed.  The screen quality is unfortunate since this would be a fantastic unit otherwise.\n', '\n  A few years ago I bought a chromebook 3 and it still works fine, but the family needed a second one. Saw this updated version and decided to give it a chance. Amazon packed the box it came it very well with the bubble wrap plus the socks I had ordered too... well done Amazon.... hahaha.I\'ve been using this for a few hours and so far I had a zoom meeting, checked my mail, personalized some settings and cleared up a few apps that were nice but I personally didn\'t need.Pros: The smaller size. It\'s not heavy on my lap. Easily fit in any backpack.Keyboard is as smooth as butter, or creamy peanut butter, depending on whether you know how to really type.Hasn\'t gotten hot... been using it for a few hours and it\'s barely warn (then again I am in an air conditioned room).I like the screen. To me, who has to wear glasses, it\'s ok. Don\'t see too much of a difference from my chromebook 3.Some have complained about having to view it from a ""sweet spot"". Please realize that many use these small laptops outside the home. Making a sideways view difficult means that some stranger sitting nearby will have trouble seeing your screen. It\'s sort of a subtle safety feature I learned about many moons ago.Cons: The charging cable is a little too short for where I want to plug in. I got a good extension cord for it.Only one usb port. I don\'t use it too much but it\'s nice to have more than one just in case one damaged.Other stuff: There is a Night light feature that I have not really tested yet since I don\'t use the computer with the lights out. It gives the screen an orange/yellow tint.And I wish it came in other colors but hey, as long as I can get online I\'m content.\n', ""\n  This is a great Chromebook with good keyboard, touchpad, and great battery life. The display is not as good as those laptops costing 2 to 4 times as much but it is fine for daily use and I don't find it be a problem even when using it for long periods of time.\n"", '\n  Pixels went out after less than 6 months.\n', '\n  This is my first Chromebook. I did alot of inquiring and research prior to purchasing. When it arrived, therse was an issue with getting signed on. After trying myself for a couple of days, I decided to call support. I am pretty sure the gentleman I spoke with has never seen a Chromebook. He had to stop and look up every possible issue and even argued with me at times. One for instance, he told me to find the 2 buttons on the scroll and click the right one. THERE ARE NOT TWO buttons. It is one smooth pad like most laptops have. After an hour of speaking with him, I was getting quite irritated. He finally decided I had to mail it in for service. They sent me a shipping label with an incorrect name and mailing address. I then had to contact them again. The ""supervisor"" stated she would send a corrected label. This NEVER came. Eventually my son came for visit from 2000 miles away and had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. SAMSUNG: PLEASE get some people in your tech support that have a clue.Once signed on, this is a great little machine. I read so many negatives about the poor quality of the screen and I DO NOT see a problem. It is clear and bright. The biggest thing I am noticing is the speed - WAY faster than my old laptop!\n', '\n  Estaba con la duda de esta chromebook. Increíble funcionalidad. La batería dura 3-4 días usándola 6-8 hrs continuas. Yo la uso para archivos PDF, Word, Excel, correos, etc. Muy liviana, cómoda. Si quieren una laptop para el día a día esta es una excelente opción.

La camera la verdad no es de mucha calidad.  Voy a agregar otro para mi trabajo.2.  La pantalla no tiene el mejor imagen.  Bastante borrosoEs un buen equipo para el precio, pero si quieres video bueno sugiero otro modelo.  Yo uso monitores duales con el equipo asi que no es tan critico pero si ero mi unico remedio me hubiero cambiando por video mejor y precio mas alto.\n']"

It was easy to use, and had all the capabilities my child required for virtual school (mostly run on Google meets and Zoom).  3 months after we received it, the device stopped working completely - black screen even when power was on. I spent an hour with Acer customer support. They tried to walk me through a system recovery, but the device would not execute the recovery. My daughter begins virtual school in one week. I asked the customer service to replace my product, but they refused. They will only agree to have me ship it to the factory for service, and I must wait 3+ weeks for repair. I argued that breaking after 3 months of use indicates product defect, and that they should replace it. It is under full warranty. They will not do so. So, I am warning parents to consider another chrome book product, as the company - ACER - will not stand behind their products when defective.\n', '\n  I wasn\'t fully sure what to expect, I\'ve never had a chromebook but really needed something that I could take with me on the go to work on my shop updates, work stuff, and school when that starts up. It\'s taking some getting used to but I\'m loving it so far! Battery life is as expected, I left it on overnight and I still had a full battery the next morning. Touchscreen is responsive. Shipping was STUPID FAST, ordered it Saturday night and received it Monday out here butt-shuck nowhere, Wyoming. So, ya know, impressive. Definitely like a tablet with a keyboard, but it\'s so much better than any tablet I\'ve used. I have a fire kindle (same thing as a tablet imo. One of those gifts you get and you\'re like ""ohhhhhhhh, thaaaaankkkkksssss....I\'ma never use this. But thank you."" Obviously you never tell them that because that would be rude, so instead it sits in the bookcase with your hard copies collecting dust because you don\'t want to get rid of it and have them find out.) and -anyway- this thing blows it out of the park. Feels lightweight but sturdy at the same time, it\'s no little biiiish, it feels like it can hold it\'s own.\n', ""\n  I'm 72 and have been agonizing replacing my aging Asus laptop. Back and forth between a Chromebook or a laptop. Read reviews on the differences, threw a dart, and ordered this Chromebook. What a great decision. Opened it up, plugged it in and turned it on. Then answered a few questions and it synched with my Note8. I like to cook and can hardly wait to look up a recipe, tent it, and start creating.  I have very simple computer needs, email, banking, and, looking up recipes. For me this is a 5.\n"", '\n  Much faster and of course newer than my old Acer 15"" Chromebook, which was one of the first 15"" models they made and the only 15"" Chromebook on the market when I bought it. I got this because I wanted something good for couch surfing and my old Chromebook doesn\'t support Android apps so it was starting to feel very limited in use. I decided on this model after reading a lot of positive reviews, which mainly turned out to be for the last model that uses this devices same name.I\'ll start off by saying this thing feels really sturdy, built well in typical Acer fashion. But I\'m kind of surprised with how big the bezels are, they easily could\'ve put a bigger screen in the thing. The screen that is installed though is plenty bright enough for my use, and is perfectly sharp at a typical viewing distance with good viewing angles. The touchscreen is kind of flaky in my experience, but that could be a problem with the user since some touchscreens just don\'t like responding well to my fingers. Performance in typical use is perfectly fine, but don\'t expect to do much gaming as it doesn\'t have the power to run more intense Android games smoothly. WiFi is very fast and signal is excellent. The ports provided are great, and I love that it can be charged from either USB-C port. The keyboard feels pretty good and the trackpad is about what you\'d expect on a device like this.Now where I am truly disappointed is in the fact that stylus support was removed from the last model of this system. I\'m a bit of an artist and like to draw on occasion, even if it\'s just playing a round of Draw Something to fix my itch. I thought drawing on this with an Android app would be pretty nice compared to my Note phone. And another person had already asked if this system supported an active stylus, which Acer responded by saying yes. This thing absolutely does NOT support an active stylus. At least not an EMR one like you find in Samsung devices (S-Pen) or a Wacom stylus. I\'m tempted to send this model back and order the older one since there doesn\'t seem to be much difference between the N3350 and N4020 CPUs.I\'ll also mention here that the indent for the second camera that goes above the keyboard for use in tablet mode is present, but there isn\'t a camera. I was unsure what this indent was for until I did some more reading online and found a review for a pre-release version of this system. That included the camera and stylus. Seems they changed their minds on both features but didn\'t bother to get rid of the indent.Long story short, it\'s a good little 2-in-1 but some design choices are odd for a device in 2020. Also many of the reviews out there are for the last model (N3350 CPU) or for pre-production test units that have features this thing actually doesn\'t have (stylus and second camera). Also look at the true reviews closely as this thing is offered with the Intel CPU (N4020), and AMD CPU, and a MediaTek CPU.\n', ""\n  Got this for elementary school children. I've never owned a chromebook so didn't know what to expect, but so far it has impressed me.  Easy to setup with a google account.  Also like how you can apply parental controls using google family.  As far as the device itself-- love the touchscreen.  My kids don't really use the flipped mode but i like that it is an option.  Very happy with my purchase.  Also, I didn't buy the extended protection but am now thinking I will.\n"", '\n  bought at $249.00 Respectable specs for price given current demand. Getting 8+ hours of battery life surfing web and watching YouTube. If you cant tell from pics. micro SD slot reader for media and volume rocker on side. your play store app compatibly will vary. please note that only about 20 GB of that storage is available for apps. if you are new to Chromebooks (or computers in general) this is more of a tablet+ than a full laptop replacement\n', '\n  I ordered it for my daughter for her to take online classes from camp and school. We are very happy with this chromebook. it is also touch screen and can be folded like a book so easier for her to use when reading books. We are able to install all needed apps to complete her work.\n', '\n  It’s beautiful and everything was easy! So happy.\n', ""\n  It is not the newest specs, but it does everything my wife needs and more.  She uses it all the time and does not touch the PC.  The ability to install and run every Android app we have tried adds a lot of functionality to chromebooks.  Although it does not fully replace a Windows based PC (or Mac) for functionality, with the ability to surf the web, stream music, watch videos, send and receive email, use Office 365 (or other options) and add the ability to send SMS messages through their android phone I don't the reason most people would ever need a full PC.\n"", '\n  \xa0Due to Covid-19, school has gone virtual and we were having laptop shortages. It was so hard to find a decent and not too pricey laptop. Luckily I found this chrome book. I looked at stores like Best Buy etc. and this exact same product was $500+ so I’m very happy I scored a good deal! It took less than 2 weeks to come in the mail and as I’m using it right now, it works great. It’s touch screen and bends backwards too if you need it just like a tablet but works as a laptop as well. Camera quality is good as well for zoom or other classroom video calls. It’s perfect, if you’re looking for a decent, not too pricey laptop for your kids school.\n', ""\n  I'll be honest, this is the 3rd Chromebook I order and by far the best one. The size is PERFECT and worth forgiving a tad smaller than bigger and lesser quality. Perfect thickness for carrying around and doesn't feel bulky. No matter if using as a laptop or tablet or just a stand to watch videos or movies, I love it. The sound quality could be better but again it's a laptop not a sound system. With a Bluetooth speaker set it's perfect. The keyboard is as described unlike others I have purchased and the video quality is more than acceptable. Some Chromebooks have better sound quality, others better video qualities but lack in important other functions. This one checks every box just right. You won't be disappointed trust me. I did a lot of homework before ordering this one and landed on perfection.\n"", '\n  That is the only thing.  The Battery wears quickly.  Sound is the pits so you need to connect to other speakers.  Wifi is good especially on zoom.\n', ""\n  I bought this Chromebook as an upgrade to my devices that I have here as they are nearly 10yrs old. So, I am using it as I would use my tablet particularly for browsing the web  It works very well. I am also a big music listener of both web music and of local mp3 files. It generally works well for this as I listen to it on bluetooth headphones. However there is a problem when using the Chromebook to cast my music to my Google Chromecast Ultra on my Samsung TV. It casts the screen tabs and video ok. Using my installed Pulsar Pro music player app which is Chromecast enabled I see that I get the audio signal to the Chromecast however it then just sits there and buffers (spinning wheel), no music. It works well when sent via bluetooth to my headphones. I also am trying to cast my local music files via the cast option on the Chrome browser, by selecting 'local files' from an SD card.  It functions ok by bringing up the file I pick, however it does not cast it to my Chromecast; just returns to the file folder again. So something is going on - the Chromebook won't cast, my music the old tablets I have will cast. I Googled this problem, and others are having this same problem with their Chromebooks as well. It is my sincere hope that Acer or whoever is responsible can fix this issue as it is a dealbreaker for me. I am also in touch with the Pulsar app developer and am awaiting their response. In the meantime I'll wait and see if perhaps any online updates might come through to resolve this issue. Otherwise the Chromebook works to my satisfaction.\n""]"

Bezels are a lot smaller than most budget Chromebooks; I honestly prefer a little bezel to grab the screen without the mouse thinking you're trying to press something.The keyboard is unbelievable. Typing is extremely fast and responsive. Perfectly spaced keys. It's quiet, and has just the right amount of click so you know when you typed a letter. It's back-lit, but dims off when not in use. You will have to change the search key to caps lock in the settings, if that is something you're used to.The mouse is very responsive as well. I have purchased a Logitech Pebble in black which matches perfectly; it also pairs up via Bluetooth, so you don't have to have a USB receiver sticking out of the side of your Chromebook!The battery life so far is all-day. I think we all know how nice it is to open a Chromebook/Laptop and still have most of the juice in it. One of my favorite things about Chromebooks, including this one, is having a USB-C charging port on EITHER side of the device; therefore, if there is an outlet closer to you on one side, you can connect to that side.The price is unreal; $409 for a 10th gen i3, this thing is just as fast if not faster than older gen i5 and i7 computers. RAM hasn't been an issue, nor 64 GB memory. I store all of my documents on Google Drive, so storage is not an issue. Additionally, there is a microSD port on the side, but I decided not to use it since the SD card isn't completely flush.Last BUT NOT LEAST, this thing is sleek and elegant. This is THE nicest looking Chrombook in the low-budget range. The charcoal/dark grey is beautiful and modern. The keys, hinges, screen, and logos are minimal and pleasing. The use of space is perfect; the speakers are on either side of the keyboard. No space is wasted in this Chromebook. The screen has a nice glossy shimmer.There is only ONE con to this amazing machine, and it is a minor one: opening the screen. Unlike the Pixelbook Go, this Chromebook takes two hands to open. There no cut-out on the screen lid, so it can sometimes be tricky to open, especially since the device is very thin. Like I said, this is not only minor, but it is the ONLY issue I have come across.Overall, I can hands down recommend this device over all other Chromebooks. This is THE ONE.  Affordable, practical, and exquisite. Well done Lenovo. Thank you for saving me money in a time like this.\n"", '\n  Revised - 9/30/20I must apologize to Lenovo. The issues I was facing was from my own doing. I forgot that I had set the OS to dev mode sometime ago and that was causing the device to act up. After setting the OS back to standard mode, it is running smoothly not freezing once.  All our headache went away.  Back to 5 stars!Revised - 9/24/20Stay AWAY!! Now the sound is going away during my daughter\'s virtual class.  We need to restart the device in order to get the sound back.  I would stay away from this device if you need something for school.  Our first Chromebook so not sure if this is normal for Chromebook.  Very dissapointed to say the least.Revised - 9/23/20Our device is starting to freeze daily and needing restart.  This is extremely frustrating for my 4th grade daughter when learning virtually.  It is not like she has too many files or apps open so I\'m down grading this to three stars.With our kids needing more time on computer for their schoolwork during the COVID19, we finally decided to purchase a chromebook.  What I wanted was a unit with 14"" monitor, FHD, at least 4GB Ram, at least 64GB storage, a decent processor, and touchscreen.  That got my attention on Asus Flip 434 and HP X360 but perhaps due to the dwindling inventories, I was not finding any attractive deals for these or any of the mid range chromebooks in the weeks studying the market.And then I came across the soon to be released Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 with all but one of the spec I was looking for; it has a 13.3"" monitor.  But at $409, I could deal with the slightly less monitor size so I preordered a unit.The product came 1 day early and we had it for close to a week now.  The build quality is solid with quality feel throughout. One exception is the edge along the trackpad at the very side of the unit.  When flipping the laptop to a tablet, I noticed the edge plastic along the trackpad move slightly since it is thin. We\'ll see if it can withstand the usage by our kids.  But that is the only concern I have.The display is very crisp with wide viewing angle.  I like the keystrokes on the keyboard.  It zips through any of the activities we do granted we are using mostly for web browsing and video conferencing. The only game my kids tried was Roblox since their 3 year old tablet is having hard time playing it.  The Flex 5 plays it very smoothly.For me, this is my first Chromebook experience so I\'m still getting used to the little differences from the PC/Windows but it\'s not that difficult.  It\'s no different then when a new version Windows is released.I am very pleased with the purchase and hope one unit will be enough for the four of us：）\n', '\n  After six months of use the right hinge broke and started flexing the screen out.Looks like a bad design. Lenovo repair has you fill out a repair ticket but no info as where to send it, RMA or any other info.I have laptops that are over four years old and dont have any problems with hinges.*UPDATE* Lenovo fixed the hinge but broke the covers in the processes. Looks like they used a crowbar to pry them off. Took three months to get the unit back.  I would look at the Acer Spin over this.\n', '\n  I\'ve used quite a few Chromebooks before (Samsung, Pixelbook, Acer, HP). This time I wanted something that had a 14"" Full HD screen and an Intel Core i3+ processor (main for my children to use), but also wanted something that was snappy.For $400, this Chromebook has been impressive and has a solid build and is fairly lightweight.- Keyboard is great with keys nicely placed.- The HD touchscreen is sharp- The unit performs well with a moderate amount of tabs open, streaming two Youtube videos is no problem.- The flip screen is a nice touch- There\'s a good # of ports as well (dual USB-C, USB-A, headphone jack, mini-SD card slot)- The webcam is great for video conferencing (even comes with a neat built-in webcam cover ).- Installing apps from the Google Play store was simple enough.It is a great Chromebook this price point!\n', '\n  What can I say it’s just as good as I thought it would be. It’s well made and very fast! My other laptop that runs windows 10 has a i7, 8GB of ram, and a SSD. This feels just as fast (or faster) for half the price and better portability.\n', '\n  We were quite excited about this device (Lenovo Flex 5 13"" chromebook). Everything seemed \'just right\' for us. From what I can tell (and I\'m not a techie), this is a good quality, sharp device. I also like that it would have the full 7 year auto-update service from Google (as it\'s a new model chromebook). Some other brand-new (but older model) chromebooks only had 1-2 yrs left on the auto-updates. Something to consider when shopping around!We deliberately ordered this item from the Canadian amazon site, thinking it\'d be covered by Lenovo Canada. We also had the intention of purchasing the extended warranty from Lenovo Canada. Unfortunately, this item was shipped from the US and is only serviced in the US: ""This machine has a 1yr limited warranty with Mail-in Service in the USA only. If you\'re in Canada, and want the machine to be serviced, the machine\'s warranty claim won\'t be covered in that country. You will have to send it to the USA with shipping arranged for and paid by you. In addition, this machine does not have the International Warranty Service (IWS). Chx_Lenovo""For us, this is a deal breaker and we will be returning the device.\n', '\n  Picked up the Lenovo Flex 5 13"" for my young son who uses Chromebooks at school.  After a bunch of research it came down to this or the Lenovo C330.  I was originally favouring ASUS but learned that, surprisingly, Lenovo has some of the best Chromebook offerings.  Buying an affordable Chromebook isn\'t easy because you\'re basically looking for the best offering among some of the lowest PC specs available.  Nothing stands out as being particularly great unless you start approaching a cost that has you wondering why you\'re still looking at Chromebooks.  In the end I chose to spend a little more for something newer and faster that could perhaps get my son through his grade school years.The Lenovo Flex 5 13"" stood out for a couple of reasons based on the reviews I read.  Right off the bat it has a decent fully HD (1920x1080) screen.  I think the screen looks great -- nice brightness and good contrast.  The viewing angle is a bit limited as I noticed that swaying left to right even a little bit started to affect the viewable colours on the sides of the screen but overall the effect was negligible.The touch screen was a bonus.  I know my son likes to work with his iPad so I figured at times the touch interface could be more intuitive.  The screen can be flipped back into tablet mode and the touch screen worked well but it\'s certainly not as comfortable to hold as a slim iPad.  Plus, you now have the keyboard exposed on the ""bottom"" which is a bit awkward.  Sometimes it is just easier and faster to just touch the screen than use the touchpad though.The interface and browsing was pretty snappy with the Core i3-10110U Processor.  The 4GB of RAM was the main factor that had me hesitating on this purchase but so far it hasn\'t been a problem.  I\'m very pleased with how fluid and responsive the system feels.Keyboard has a decent size, it\'s backlit, and it feels good for a notebook.  The touchpad is also fairly large and it\'s responsiveness was perfectly fine.  Note that if you have never worked with a Chromebook before, it DOES take some getting used to some of the touchpad gestures.  For example, you don\'t just click the right side of the touchpad for a right-click, you need to tap the touchpad with two fingers.  You can scroll windows by swiping up and down with two fingers. etc.  I personally do not find the Chromebook interface to be very intuitive which is a bit of a concern for my younger son but I know he\'ll learn.  Many options are simply hidden from the screen and you just need to know the appropriate gestures or button clicks to work your way around the system.Speakers face upwards and I found them plenty loud.  I don\'t expect great quality from built-in speakers but these did the job.The Flex 5 13"" also has a full size USB-A connector which some Chromebooks don\'t offer.  It might be a minor thing but this makes it easy to connect any typical mouse or memory stick you probably have.  I think this is just convenient for people without the technical know-how to deal with converting USB interfaces.  There are also USB-C ports on both sides which is also convenient.Storage-wise, the Flex 5 13"" comes with about 46GB of free space out of the box.No problems connecting to Wifi.  The connection remained stable and fast.Overall I am please with this purchase.  I have nothing to complain about.  I was probably hoping to spend about 3/4 of the price for a Chromebook ($538 at the time of my purchase) but I think the little extra money was well spent in this case.  Except for the 4GB of memory, I don\'t feel I\'ve compromised on anything.  Being a newer product it will also continue to receive Google updates for a while.\n', '\n  Did my research for either a laptop or tablet.  Didn\'t really care which for my purposes (basically, surfing and as I just ""cut the cable"", a way to cast to my TV.Settled on this laptop.  With trial Prime, I got it in a day.Boots up very quickly and after going through a few simple steps, got the chrome OS updated to 84.  So far so good.  It has one camera (facing user) but couldn\'t get it to work. It is functional (there is a website that tests it ""online""--works great).  No way to turn it on/off???  Camera is not listed in the installed apps.There was no camera app included and I was not going to use a 3rd party app on a brand new machine.Called Lenovo and after an hour on the phone, THEY KNOW NOTHING/NADA/ZILCH about Chrome OS (specifically, where is the camera function).  They only know WIN10. Referred me to google (as it\'s Chrome OS).  NO ONE HOME at google due to virus so no phone support.So, get back in touch with Amazon and because of trial Prime, they sent a replacement (and I received it) the next day. Great service guys!Ok, got the replacement and this one has a camera app.  Camera works.  Next issue: casting and sleep mode.Well, it does cast and does so flawlessly.  BUT the issue is when the laptop goes to sleep (~5 min), it shuts down then shortly thereafter (ie when in sleep mode) casting shuts down (pauses).  You have to close the lid, open the lid, re-start the laptop and then re-start casting.  Not going to do this 40x over the course of a 2 hour movie.2nd unit going back.THE GOOD: love the keyboard action, the overall feel of the case (does leave fingerprints I must say) and am happy with the display. Response time is good but because of the noted issues, I only had it for a day for ""testing"" it\'s abilities.THE BAD: no fix for sleep mode.  There is no button to either lengthen the non-sleep period nor to disable sleep mode at all.  No good for casting (chromecast, firestick, whatever). From reading online, this issue surfaced with most recent chrome OS update. No solution.THE BEST: Amazon customer service was the best ever.  Thumbs up to you!\n', '\n  Try to use Zoom and keeps freezing up.I can’t figure it out and this computer is useless for me.\n', '\n  High quality notebook. Keys are as good as they get. Display is crystal clear. i3 provides all the power a chromebook needs.This is a fantastic Chromebook. You have access to Android apps!!Jim\n']"

I like that the Go is a bit smaller and lighter than the Pixelbook. It feels very solid to me, more so than the Pixelbook. It's a keeper for me. I have the cheapest version with the M3 processor and it seems perfectly fine for general use. I haven't run into any slowdowns yet, but I also don't do any gaming or video editing, just general internet use.\n"", '\n  Let’s be honest, a laptop is a laptop, at the end of the day not much to them except screen, looks and how it all is put together.  I have a windows pc for gaming, but when I want an easy to use all arounder I love using chromebooks.  I have a pixel slate but wanted a regular laptop for school work to take with me anywhere I am going to go.  Rather than go over another typical laptop review I mean there is really nothing I can add except tell you why I choose it over the competition.What I want in a laptop:  looks, good battery life, good keyboard, nice display, thin/light, reliable, good price and decent performance.The go versus:Asus 425/433/434:  these are probably the biggest competition in price, looks and performance,  The issue with the 434 is the lack of reliability with numerous reports for users. At 3.2 lbs it is kinda heavy, and the 433 has a cheap keyboard deckHp/Dell 14 inch:  I put these both together because they are similar and they both are very heavy approaching closer to 4 lbs.  To give you an idea my 15.6 gaming laptop weighs 4.8 lbs. The dell is not very attractive to me and more bland.  The HP is attractive but still heavy, not a bad choice, but not the best option IMO.Acer Spin 13:  very premium,  but more of an industrial design, also heavy, great performance though.  UHD display.Pixelbook:  probably the best alternative, and checks a lot of boxes but I find the large bezels very dated. Still expensive if you want to buy it new.Samsung plus V2:  another good alternative with a metal lid.  Under 3 lbs and not bad looking.  The bottom portion is plastic and it does feel like it.  Plain 1080p panel.The pixelbook go has a good 1080p panel which you don’t find often in chromebooks unfortunately.  Outside of the pixelbook the go is the only other one under 2.5 lbs.  It is also thin.  Slim side bezels.  Great speakers and keyboard.  The go checks all my boxes for a laptop perfect for this my masters program.When I first heard the go announced I was upset in the pricing, but then I compared it to the competition.  At regular price almost all the competition sells at $599.  The base pixelbook go that I bought is $649.  The go is $50 dollars more but compared to the rivals it has a leg up on build quality and looks with many of them.  Now most of the other laptops I mention they have been on sale for significantly lower than msrp so you might want to consider that.  There also is no fold-able display like many of the others, which for me has less meaning for the way I use the device.What google did was refine the basic laptop and wrapped it in a pretty bow, which is the same thing that surface laptop, macbook air have done.\n', ""\n  Brilliant laptop! The build quality is top notch and everything from the keyboard and track pad to the full HD screen is a very pleasant and premium experience.  I got the base model and I think for most people that's all you need unless you need more storage. Chrome OS is lightweight already, so the laptop has absolutely zero performance issues with it's configuration.  The battery is stellar, I'm getting nearly 12 hours before having to charge, and it has fast-charging capabilities when you do have to.  The only limitations are Chrome OS, which isn't a problem for me since I'm only using things like google docs and sheets for school. If you need programs for heavy photo or video editing or if you're planning to play anything more intense than an android game than this laptop isn't for you. But if you need a beautiful, fast and simple OS that allows you to answer emails, write a few documents and watch some Netflix with ease than look no further than this machine.\n"", ""\n  I really wanted to love this unit but it's got a screen flicker bug and support is refusing to provide a timeline for updates.  As with most things google, if it works great, if you have trouble expect to get lost in a maze of different departments all of whom have no real answers.  You get the software when they deliver it and if there is a problem you wait months for them to resolve it.For those that might be using this as an alternative to linux.  There is still a lot of things you can't do.  You can't attach USB devices to the linux container ( unless it's android ) so things like Ethernet or other devices are right out.  You can't have inbound port access without 3rd party chrome apps which do port redirection ( and clobber the originating IP ), while they claim GPU support it's pretty lackluster at this point.  They are making movements to removing hyper-threading totally from the software which would be a 30-40% negative impact on performance compared to similar outfitted notebooks.EDIT:After nearly a month they appear to have corrected one of the flickering issues, the most annoying one at least.  Raising review two 3 stars for the time being.\n"", ""\n  Want to sort some data in Excel? No.Want to open two Word documents at the same time? Nope.Want to right click on a misspelled word? JK. LOL. Nope.Want to save a file and then attach it to an email? Not today my man! (Note: There is a weird workaround where you can save things into the Download folder on the hard-drive and then attach from there. Otherwise it's useless.)I cannot begin to image what makes this an expensive computer. It is alarmingly difficult to perform the most basic functions. I'm a graduate school student and bought it for online classes. It fails so miserably that I have to do all of my work at the office.\n"", '\n  If it was a Windows laptop I would give it 5 stars without any complaint. Even if it takes $200 more expensive to be Windows compatible I would still give it 5 stars.Good screen. Good Keyboard. Great speakers. Good build quality. Great portability. Great battery life.This chromebook is really thoughtfully designed. There are so many details that have been taken care of. If you are a electronic geek you will feel it. It\'s not just another Chromebook. The quality and design justifies the price. Some people may say, at such price you can buy a windows laptop with better specs. That is not all true. You can buy a windows laptop with powerful CPU, higher SSD capacity, but not so lightweight and portable. If a windows laptop is so portable and still more powerful, it price would be above CAD$1200.However, it is still a Chromebook. The limitation of chromeOS makes me unable to give 5 stars. Let alone the lack of ""photography retouch softwares"" which most people complain about.  It lacks some more essential software support. For example, a full-function microsoft Office. Some documents are messed if they are opened in google docs or microsoft office web version, they can only be properly processed in a Windows/Mac microsoft office. There is not a full-function Adobe PDF reader either. Sometimes a PDF needs to be validated to generate a barcode and only windows/mac adobe reader can do this. ChromeOS is so crippled that it can only be used for ""light entertainment "", and Google does not want to change this status. It seems google wants to distinguish ChromeOS from anything else, but in a bad way. ChromeOS has been out for 10 years and is still a joke. I recently found a bug that the touchscreen become offset when there is a drop-down menu on the webpage. I\'ll update with pictures if I have time.\n', ""\n  Fantastic piece of hardware. Yes, you pay for it, but I have never owned anything this nice. From keyboard to trackpad to display to speakers, every bit of it is top notch. And if you're like me, you'll appreciate the matte black finish. My only annoyance is that the cable that came with it is white.... But I can get over that. If you're OK with not having a convertible form factor (but still having a touch screen) this is the best Chromebook available.\n"", ""\n  So this is my first time buying a Chromebook and I'm not going to lie for the price it's actually worth it. It runs smooth no hiccups no nothing the only thing I can say is that I wish the screen was sharper it's only 166ppiIn my opinion it should be at least 250 and up but it's not a deal-breaker for the screen it is still pretty good. if the screen was sharper I would give it a complete five out of five but because of the screen I'm knocking it down half a point so 4.5/5\n"", ""\n  It's a slick little machine BUT a laptop it's not ... I only wish Google would make something that truly rivals a real laptop, they are close with this machine , but still not quite there\n"", '\n  from the touchscreen to the speakers and the 10n- 12 hour battery life..its amazing. i settled for the 8gb / 128ssd storage. for a student it does everything i need. its great for gaming (stadia) , work, watching movies and browsing. i originally wanted the 4k display but i settled the 1080p. to be honest, it might not look like much out of the box, but as soon as you change the wallpaper and watch videos or play games, the screen is beautiful and abundant for anyones needs. must get.\n']"
