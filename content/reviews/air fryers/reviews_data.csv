My friend recommended this for me. It looks cool. I cooked chicken today at 400F for 20min. The flavor is amazing. The meat is so tender. It's much much better than the oven. The design is good. There is a panel. You can select for chips, meat l, chicken, cake, bacon and shrim. It's so convenient. Just hit the button. You do need to take time to make these settings. To be mentioned.  There is one Pan for food and the other one under it is used to hold the oil. When you clean it you can separate these two pans. It's easy to clean in this way.\n"", '\n  The air fryer was absolutely stunning! Wasn’t complicated at all to use. Very spacious, which allows me to make an abundance for my family. I gave it a test run and the chicken came out tender and crispy.

The operation is simple and fast, the shape and color are also good, the meat and chicken legs roasted with it are delicious and delicious!\n', ""\n  This air fryer has gotten a LOT of use in my home since we received it about a month ago. The very first thing we did in it was chicken wings. I really love the way the wings come out with a little bit of crisp to the skin but super moist and juicy inside. We've also air fried chicken legs and breasts. We did soak our chicken all day in our marinade before air frying it and love the way it turns out. I love that we are no longer using oil to fry our chicken. We've also air fried french fries and onion rings, which also turned out great. This has a permanent spot on our counter top now as it gets used at least twice a week. It's easy to clean and easy to use.\n"", '\n  Perfect for any aspiring chef or anyone who wants to save time from cooking full meals.I am a full-time student and researcher, and is stacked with back-to-back projects, I found the air fryer to be very convenient for my needs.

But this was too good and is my main airfryer now. Got it about a week ago and used it most days even for toast and re heating chicken. I was able to get some amazing french fries out of this.The square shape helps with space management inside. UI is easy to use too.\n', '\n  I was very impressed at how much room it had. It was super easy to work and did not require too much figuring out. It is super sleek and while it is quite big it is not an eye sore which I like.

I don't like the mess. It takes too much time. My recipes never turn out like they show in the cookbooks...and my cooking is pretty awful. I got the Cosori Air Fryer a couple of weeks ago, and I've been happily cooking every day, multiple times a day since.You just pull it out of the box, and it's ready to go. The detachable basket and pan are all that needed cleaning in soapy water before adding food. The buttons are self-explanatory. You've got a snowflake for frozen foods, fries for fries, bacon for bacon, and also Preheat and Keep Warm.When I first turned it on, I wasn't sure what to expect. I wondered if it was going to get hot and scorch my counter (or me). I thought it would be noisy. It was none of those things. It does get a little warm on the outside but not hot like an oven. You do need to be careful when you're pulling the basket out or any food from inside the fryer because it's deceiving that it works so quickly and gets food that hot that fast. As for noise, you can hear the air moving, but I wouldn't call it noisy. My Alexa is near the air fryer, and the Alexa hears me just fine when I'm talking while the air fryer is running. Also, since my Alexa is near the air fryer, you can tell that the air fryer doesn't get too hot or spit things at you or I wouldn't have the Alexa there.The air fryer looks great on my counter too. It's already become a conversation piece in my kitchen. I had family over this weekend, and they wanted to know what it was. I put on a kitchen demo of sorts, and everyone stood around and watched, then ate all of the food (not a crumb left on the plates!), and then they said they needed to get an air fryer too.So far, I've tried recipes in the included recipe book as well as a recipe for chicken fried steak in an air fryer cookbook I purchased separately. What's great about the cookbook included in the Cosori air fryer is that each recipe has a picture with it, and the ingredients aren't intimidating to those of you like me who don't care for cooking. Most recipes call for ingredients you've actually heard of and probably have in your pantry -- a real plus for me because I also hate wandering around in a grocery store searching for a random ingredient I'll only use once.The very first recipe I tried was sweet potato fries in the included Cosori cookbook. I like my fries a little crunchy, so I probably could have left them in the air fryer a few minutes longer than the recipe called for, but they were still delicious. Definitely the best sweet potato fries I've ever had.For fun, I then threw in some frozen okra I had bought in the freezer section. I bought a water bottle and filled it with olive oil, so all I did was lightly squirt the olive oil on the okra while in the air fryer basket and then just pushed the snowflake button. The okra came out so crunchy, just the way I like it. And I couldn't believe it had gone from frozen to crispy crunchy in just a matter of minutes. Most of them were golden brown, but I could tell the ones that I had missed when I sprayed the okra with the olive oil. Those were white -- still crunchy and tasted fine, but a weird-looking white. I've since bought a pressurized oil sprayer can that's specifically for spraying olive oil, and it works much better at spraying everything evenly than my plastic water bottle.Same night and onto my third recipe: chicken fried steak. Now, this recipe wasn't in the incuded Cosori cookbook. This particular cookbook didn't have a picture, so I wasn't at all sure how it would turn out. It's so good, I've cooked it twice in three nights.That night's entire meal was cooked in the air fryer: sweet potato fries, frozen-turned-air fried okra, and chicken fried steak. It felt like an elaborate meal with hardly any time invested, and my kitchen wasn't a disaster after cooking all of that. I only had a few plates and a couple of bowls that I'd used instead of pots and pans and baking dishes all piled up on my counter with a greasy stove to clean.The next day, I tried the mozzarella cheese sticks in the included Cosori cookbook. I totally botched this recipe, using baking soda instead of cornstarch. Did I mention how bad I am at cooking? Even so, the mozzarella sticks worked out okay (but not great, which was likely my own fault). They crisped up nicely and quickly. They just didn't look a thing like the picture in the recipe book. I would have also liked the cheese to be more melted on the inside. It seemed like the outside was really crispy and the inside wasn't really melted. This could all be because of my using the wrong ingredient, so I'll give it another shot because, even with the wrong ingredient, they weren't bad. They didn't taste like mozzarella cheese sticks, but they were still good.For dinner, I cooked the kids grilled cheese sandwiches also using the included cookbook. These didn't turn out as expected. At least I used the right ingredients this time. But the cheese wasn't gooey like it would be if you cooked it on the stove. If I had doubled the amount of cheese the recipe called for it would probably be perfect. The bread was golden brown, though. It was a bit of a pain to have to melt butter on the stove, then brush it onto the bread, then grate cheese before putting it into the air fryer. I can get a grilled cheese sandwich in a pan quicker than that, but it was still fun to try. I'll try the recipe again with more cheese. I think it's a recipe I can tinker with to make perfect.I then tried the pizza from the Cosori recipe book. I didn't use pizza dough. I prefer pita bread. I followed the instructions as if it was pizza dough, which means you preheat the air fryer, brush your crust with olive oil, and then put it in the air fryer at 320 for five minutes. Then you take it out to add toppings. On mine, I put pizza sauce, pepperoni, mozzarella, and parmesan. Pop it back into the air fryer for another five minutes at 320, and it's done. It was so good. I'll be making another for lunch. The only downside was having to cook one at a time because I couldn't fit two pieces of pita bread in the basket together.My most-recent recipe to try is the coconut shrimp, which is also in the cookbook that comes with the air fryer. What would normally be a giant mess of the kitchen was only three bowls to dredge the coconut shrimp and then a plate to put them on. You preheat the air fryer while you're getting everything ready, and then pop the shrimp in for eight minutes. They were very tasty, but I'll add more coconut in my dredge next time than the recipe calls for. The recipe was good, but I couldn't really taste the coconut.I keep picking out new recipes to try in the cookbook, which is a first for me with my loathe of cooking. I've included pictures of the country fried steak, pizza, grilled cheese, mozzarella sticks, and coconut shrimp that I've made so far.Even owning the 5.8 quart, you have to get used to cooking in batches. I wanted to make four chicken fried steaks that first night, but there was only room for two. Not a big deal. You just have to cook in batches. Making three pita bread pizzas, I just had to make each one separately since I could only fit one round piece of pita in at a time. For the grilled cheese sandwiches, two actually fit into the air fryer at the same time.Like I said before, the cookbook that comes with the air fryer is full of pictures. It also has more than 100 pages of recipes. For example, you'll find recipes for strawberry cream scones, stuffed french toast, BBQ bacon, ribeye, meatballs, fried chicken, crab cakes, wings, pigs in a blanket, french fries, onion rings, roasted corn, cheddar buttermilk biscuits, cinnamon rolls, pound cake, and orange cranberry muffins. I would be lost without the cookbook. It also tells you exactly which button to push on the air fryer too, so you're learning about how to use your air fryer while you're actually cooking instead of having to read an instruction manual cover to cover before you even have enough confidence to cook something.I mentioned not having many dishes to clean after using the air fryer. What I love most about cleanup is how easy the air fryer itself is to clean. Everything just slides off of it. I'm barely scrubbing it, and it's clean. I know the description says it's dishwasher safe, but I just wash it in the sink because there's nothing ever dried on and stuck to it. I love how I can put a little soap on it, and it's clean and ready for my next recipe. The water beads on it, so it dries really fast.The only negative about the air fryer is probably my own impatience with one of the controls. The temp/time is shared by one button. If you have a recipe that calls for you to adjust the temp and/or time, you have to toggle the button. It starts with temp, so if you need to change how long to keep something in, you hit the temp/time button again. Somehow, I keep managing to hit time when I mean temp and vice versa.Also, the air fryer cuts off when you pull the basket out, just as it should so it's not running while there's nothing in the bottom. When you pop the basket back in, it defaults back to the original temp and time settings when you turn it on, not what you last had on there. It would be nice if it remembered what your setting was 5 minutes before. For example, the other night when I had to make the pizzas in batches, I had to run the air fryer 5 minutes for one crust, then five minutes for the next, and so on. Every time, I had to reset the time and temp when I pulled a crust out. That's when I began noticing how bad I was at toggling the temp/time button I mentioned above.Both the time/temp button being shared and the air fryer not remembering your last time/temp are extremely minor downsides. But they're the only negatives I could think of because this air fryer has quickly become my favorite kitchen appliance.I have never had any experience with an air fryer, so I have nothing to compare the Cosori air fryer against. But I did my research. read the reviews, watched videos, and crossed my fingers that I was buying the right one. I couldn't have made a better choice. I'm actually excited to cook for the first time ever. Tomorrow on the breakfast menu: french toast sticks!\n"", ""\n  Air fryer works. One major complaint is the basket / drawer leaks steams as it cooks which leaves puddles on whatever surface you have the air fryer. If you press lightly on the basket / drawer the steam stops leaking out which means either the product wasn't designed well or manufacturing tolerances are poor. Even though it works, I wouldn't recommend as the mess it makes it just too annoying to keep cleaning up after every use.** Updated 11/11/19 **After Cosori support saying that leaking steam from the basket is normal, I am reducing my overall rating to 1 star as this product is clearly made cheaply / poorly designed. Definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND buying from this manufacture and go with a competitor's product that doesn't leak steam and make a mess on your countertop.\n"", '\n  After hearing rave reviews from family and friends about using Air Fryers I thought it would be a good solution for preparing meals for one that didn’t take long to prepare, made for easy cleanup, used less energy and would allow me to have a variety of delicious meals. Unfortunately my experience with the Cosori Air Fryer has been nothing but disappointing. I’ve used it to cook steak which took much longer to cook than the literature suggested and it didn’t brown up at all. I’ve tried cooking French fries using raw potatoes and after nearly 30 minutes at 400 degrees I had limp fries that I wasn’t interested in eating. I’ve tried frozen French fries that I even sprayed lightly with canola oil hoping to help crisp them up, and again ended up with limp fries after nearly 30 minutes. I don’t know if the fan isn’t working or what the problem is but I’m not at all happy with this product.\n', ""\n  I chose this particular air fryer over hundreds offered on Amazon.  Features that were the most important to me were the number of presets (counting defrost)  (12), the warranty (1 yr), Cosori accessories, and ease of use.  It is easy to clean in the dishwasher, and the preset settings mean that I don't have to calculate time or temperature. But it's also easy to add time or subtract it if you need to. The night I received my air fryer, I made the most amazing steaks that were so tender and moist inside!  Since then, I have made Cornish hens, BBQ ribs, blueberry muffins, tater tots, and many other dishes. The fryer is not heavy and it is not loud when in use.  Do yourself a favor and buy this!\n"", '\n  My Wife and I purchased the Air Fryer and received it Sunday.  So far we have only used it twice,  but so far it is great!  We cooked Crab Cakes last night with some tater tots and biscuits this morning for breakfast.  Really easy to use and easy to clean.  So far we both love it.UpdateWe have had it a few weeks now and continue to enjoy it.  We did buy some accessories that work, but I wish that there were some designed specifically for the 5.8 QT Air fryer.  These were made for both which means they are really too small to take advantage of the 5.8 QT volume.  They only ""kind of"" work.We still love the fryer.  That is why I did not change the star rating.  But I really would like to see some specific accessories designed for the increased volume of this fryer.\n', ""\n  This air fryer is awesome! I need a large basket for walleye and this is the largest I could find (10x10), which was a selling point. However, there are so many benefits! The programmed options, the ease of cleaning, the safety button on the basket, the price, just to name a few. I've only had it a few days and I've already made a home for it on my counter and replaced my smaller, less versatile Phillip's air fryer with this dynamo. I'll keep the other one for things like fries or potatoes, while using this one for the main items.  I haven't looked at the recipe book but I'm going to do so soon. One more thing, I shop on Amazon very often and this is one of the few reviews I feel compelled to write.\n"", '\n  No me arrepiento en haber comprado esta freidora de aire a pesar de que tiene alto consumo de energía eléctrica (1600 Watts). La he recomendado con mis familiares y amistades para el consumo de alimentos sin utilizar aceite adicional, el flujo de aire caliente ayuda mucho a que todo el alimento se caliente rápido y la resistencia eléctrica que está localizado en la parte superior hace que los alimentos tengan una apariencia y textura crujiente, es muy practica y sencilla de manejar.

Recomiendo comprar el paquete de accesorios de la misma marca (que también caben en la Instant Pot). Otro consejo: es mejor usar aceite en aerosol. En general, muy buena compra.\n', '\n  Llegó en la fecha acordada, bien empaquetado. Con todos sus artículos.Excelente freidora y fácil de utilizar, cumple con lo que promete.\n', '\n  The good: it is incredibly easy to use and adjust settings. I love the app, I can control the air fryer from the shower if I want to! Very cool! Super easy to clean, it looks good as well. I was super pleased with this air fryer until today (about 1 month after it was delivered, used it a handful of times) when I noticed the black teflon coating on the bottom of the tray is peeling off in pretty big layers. I freaked out at first thinking it got stuck to our food and we ate it but then I realized it’s not actually directly touching the food because of the additional tray. But I still don’t feel comfortable about it and so I asked for a return label today.  It’s surprising really, because the machine behaved great on those first uses. Here’s hoping it was just a one off, I haven’t seen any other comments on this particular issue. We always washed it by hand in warm water, no chemicals.\n', '\n  La ame!! No debí pensar tanto para comprarla, es una gran ayuda en la cocina para las que no nos gusta estar friendo y desperdiciando tanto aceite, me llego todo bien, trae recetario en inglés. Yo pensé que iba a ser mas estorbosa pero no, es tamaño perfecto y la canasta a comparación de otras es mas grande y el que sea cuadrada es mas práctico. Lo primero que cocine fueron papas pero como puse muy pocas se me pasaron tantito ya que el tiempo indicado era mucho para la porción, pero quedaron muy crujientes asi como me gustan. Ya hice tacos dorados y tortitas de papa y quedaron perfectos! Hice carne y chistorra y chorizo y depende como te gusten de termino se ajusta y puedes pausar para ir checando y voltear los alimentos para un mejor cocimiento, pero para la carne/chistorra/chorizo recomiendo poner aluminio en la cesta externa por que la carne suelta mucha grasa y luego es mas dificil lavarla y para darle un mejor cuidado. Se puede poner aceite o no a los alimentos recomiendo utilizar aceite spray o una brochita de cocina. Algunos programas tienen la funcion de Shake (agitar/mover) por ejemplo para las papas. Tiene la opcion de precalentar y mantener caliente. La verdad es una muy buena inversión sobre todo si tu intención es cocinar con menos aceite y ahorrar tiempo en la cocina y si regularmente cocinas alimentos fritos. Aunque esta es mas cara recomendaría comprarla ya que las otras son mas pequeñas y es mas incómodo o menos práctico para acomodar los alimentos. Apenas llevo una semana utilizandola pero estoy emcantada!\n']"

The rotisserie was my favorite feature... second day, I noticed it was not turning the right way.  Turns out, the rotisserie is made of some sort of plastic/rubber that melted (see it photo).\n', '\n  First off, my apologies for being late in posting this review. I received this fryer about a week or so ago but didn\'t know what to make with it because . . . I had NEVER used an air fryer before. Also, this particular model DOES NOT COME WITH RECIPES! Nothing, zilch, nada! You pretty much have to look for your recipes online because the Instant Vortex will not provide you with any. They will give you a very broad time and heat guide but that\'s it.In fact, my main complaint with this air fryer is mainly on the bare-bones instructions. For that reason, a lot of what you do with this air fryer is going to have to be through trial and error. There are more instructions to prevent you from lighting your house on fire than there are in the operation of the machine.So, as someone who has never used an air fryer before, especially an Instant Vortex Plus 6 Quart 6-in-1 thingamajig, what did I think of it?AWESOME!But before we get to why it\'s awesome, I need to tell you what you\'re going to get when you purchase this device.THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE PURCHASING:1.) Most timers (at least in the US) when they are 00:00 it means 00 mins : 00 seconds. Not so with this air fryer. With the Instant Vortex the first two digits are hours and the last two digits are minutes. This was not clear in the instruction manual. Remember, I\'ve never used an air fryer before, so this was new to me.2.) When using air fryer mode, at around 3 quarters time, the fryer will ask you to turn over your food. This was also not very clear in the instructions.3.) The basket is SMALL and not ideal for party size servings. Six quarts is good for a couple, but anyone with a big family is going to find themselves running multiple batches to get enough food cooked. If you\'re planning a big super bowl wing fest, you might want to get something bigger.BONUS: The air fryer DOES NOT get dangerously hot like an oven. You can accidentally touch the top of the fryer and not burn your hand off. The vent in the back is also warm but not blazing hot. As long as the safety instructions are followed, this machine feels very safe to use.Somehow we didn\'t blow a fuse when using the microwave and the air fryer at the same time, so that was also impressive, but your results may vary.All right, so let\'s get into exactly how I used my air fryer as someone who has never, ever used one before.- We added pepper and salt to the raw wings. Then we greased the tray and basket with Pam cooking oil. EDIT: (Don\'t grease the tray with PAM. You can spray your food not your tray. Or use a substitute instead of PAM.)- We found an online recipe that was for 24 minutes. At the twelve minute mark we flip over the wings and cook the other side.- After putting the food into the tray and setting the fryer for 12 minutes, we quickly discovered that the fryer must PREHEAT first. After it ran through its preheat cycle, then it said ""ADD FOOD."" Whoops. The wings stayed in there anyway.- At around 5 minutes, the fryer then said ""TURN FOOD OVER."" We didn\'t know it was going to give us this prompt. So we took out the basket to check on the wings, they were cooking but not yet finished, so we flipped them over.- Once the timer was finished, we removed the basket and saw that the wings were halfway cooked, awesome! We popped them back in for another 12 minutes but made note that in the future, we just put them in for 24 and wait for the fryer to tell us when to flip. Also, not once did I feel a blast of hot air like I do when taking things out of the oven. The fryer and the basket felt safe to handle AT ALL TIMES.- After another twelve minutes it was time to taste test. Did the wings cook thoroughly or were we about to get a case of salmonella?- The answer was YES! The wings cooked thoroughly. The exterior skin was nice and crunchy while the inside was juicy and flavorful. All of the excess oil dripped off of the wings and settled at the bottom of the basket. Awesome!- Clean up required dumping out the remaining oil into a bag, then cleaning the basket and grill with paper towels and water.THEN WE TRIED COOKING SALMON USING THE BAKE SETTING.- Grease the grill with pam. EDIT: DO NOT GREASE THE GRILL WITH PAM. You can put PAM on your food but not the grill tray. Supposedly this starts to erode some of the coating on the tray. Whoops! Found this out recently.- Pop 1.6lbs of Salmon into the basket. (This time we waited for the preheat)- Cooked for 7 minutes at 389 I believe. Don\'t remember.- Took the salmon out and found that the interior was still raw. Whoops. Again, no recipes means we don\'t know what the heck we\'re doing with this thing. Pop it back in for another 7 minutes.- Salmon bakes and is now thoroughly cooked. Still good, still flavorful, but we underestimated cooking time.WHAT ABOUT THE BROIL, ROAST, REHEAT & DEHYDRATE FEATURE?I, unfortunately, do not know. We haven\'t really roasted, broiled, or dehydrated food in my house. However, if the chicken wings and salmon are the standard it sets, then I\'m sure those features will work perfectly.In fact, I have to say that I am supremely impressed with the Instant Vortex 6-in-1 multi use fryer. It\'s extremely safe t use, It cooks the food thoroughly, and it\'s super easy to clean.If you\'re looking for an air fryer with the versatility of an oven but without the hassle or increase to your gas bill, than this air fryer is definitely going to be a perfect fit for you! Very, very happy with this device and I can\'t wait to fry more food with it.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n', '\n  I had such high hopes for this air fryer and expected a lot more from this brand/company but I’m extremely disappointed in my purchase. First off the air fryer itself is very sleek and looks nice, it is easy to use but there are major design flaws. The basket/rack at the bottom is not secure and makes taking out food more difficult than it has to be as you cannot simply turn the basket over to get your food out on a plate because if you do that everything (food, bottom basket, grease) comes spilling out and crashing to the floor. The most frustrating thing however and the major deal breaker for me is not only the horrible plastic smell this air fryer emits but the toxic plastic taste it imparts on the food! Everything cooked in it is inedible because of this. I thought it may go away after a couple of uses but it has not. I cleaned all parts thoroughly several times, ran it empty several times, ran it with a ramekin full of water and lemon juice then water and vinegar and cooked several rounds of Food that tasted like a chemical/plastic and had to be thrown out. Very disappointed as this in my opinion is unusable due to terrible taste and likely toxic effect on my family’s health. Do not buy! The plastic smell and PLASTIC TASTE never went away.\n', ""\n  Unbelievably toxic smell when used--the smell filled our entire house--had to open all the windows in the kitchen (in December) and then on the vent fan--and it's still bad a few hours later.  After some internet research I see this is a common problem with this item.\n"", '\n  After several uses my air fryer still emits such a strong odor of hot plastic I put it in the garage when using it.  My husband says the food tastes like burnt plastic.  As much as I enjoy cooking with it, he’s right.  I like everything about the unit except the taste of burnt plastic on the food.  We no longer use it.\n', '\n  I have 4 teenagers at home so having the ability to air fry vs take out with same results is amazing. Frozen pizza done in 10min; fries, tater tots & potato wedges are fantastic will never use the oven method again. Chicken burgers/strips are deep fried restaurant quality. Did not like it for toast. Baked 12 muffins turned out well but ended up lop sided on top so I am assuming it\'s the dual element on top for heat placement. Fits 9x13"" cake pans & 12 cup muffin tinsel easily.\n', '\n  \xa0I like the vortex air fryer because it’s easy to use and easy to clean. I don’t need to use a lot if oil when cooking in air fryer you can see the natural oil drips in the pan, food taste good. It’s just kind of expensive though but worth the money.\n', ""\n  We have the Instant Pot from this company, and love it. But this Air Fryer is a huge disappointment.We did the 20 minute test run as advised. It had a very noisy fan, buzzes, rattles. It had a electrical burning smell, that lasted for hours after the test run. And we found a piece of broken plastic under it when we moved it to pack it up.In all fairness those issues may have been shipping damage. We noticed the corner of the box had signs of being dropped. Since it was completely external we didn't think much of it.Even if we got this Air Fryer in good working condition, the fan would be unbearable. The main reason we bought this was we thought it would be useful in a power outage running on generator power.  Unfortunately this is not up to the quality standards of the instant pot, not even close.We sent is back, and we won't be trying another.\n"", '\n  I looked at many toaster ovens with the air fryer option. This met all our needs. The digital readout is easy to read. The automatic programs are great. I am very impressed so far. And it looks great!\n', '\n  I was so excited to get my new updated toaster oven by Instant Brands a company here in Ottawa.  This company happens to be the creator of the Instant Pot a few years ago.  I am sad to say it is one big disappointment.  The temperature control cooks extremely high by about 20 degrees higher than a conventional oven.  Also, toaster ovens are known to be cool when in operation, but this really throws heat.  Now that the hot weather is here, I cannot use it after late morning.  I am a very unhappy customer.\n']"

If I could i'd take out another star from the review to make it 0 star.Update (2/20/19): Did not hear from Ninja customer service after more than a month, talked to Amazon and got a full refund.\n"", ""\n  Been studying air fryers for about two years.  Decision was about counters-pace vs basket size.  The ninja takes up slightly less space than the stand mixer.  It's lightweight and easy to pull out from under the cabinet to use (to allow for air flow).  I like it so much, I wish for a bigger one just to do my entire meal in it at once.  For two people, it does a fair amount of wings or tater tots, or the sweet potato fries pictured here.  I used the reheat function and the bang bang shrimp came out quite tasty.  Steaks came out moist and medium rare, but not seared even on the crisper plate.  It has worked well with salmon and chicken breasts.  So much easier to clean than a pan and my stove top.  It cooked those breaded chicken rounds, fish, and tater tots and  in about 10 minutes.  Much less time than a toaster oven.  The Ninja does not come with added attachments for the grilling or baking as the Phillips, but it's $200 less.  Nuff said.\n"", '\n  I unboxed this a few days ago and followed the instructions for cleaning the basket and crisping tray with hot soapy water. I’ve used five times since and each time it has filled my home with a horrible smell of burning plastic. It doesn’t look like any of the plastic parts are melting, but if you sniff the basket after cooking something the plastic smell is much stronger. I think whatever non-stick coating they use on the basket is releasing the toxic smell when heated. Really don’t think it is ceramic as they claim. Kind of a bummer since it does seem to cook food very well. I would say get this if you don’t mind having a headache from breathing fumes along with every meal.\n', '\n  I try not to eat fried food and I never thought I was missing out by not having a deep fryer, so an air fryer just seemed replacement that I didn\'t need. So I was skeptical about how much I would use this... maybe a few frozen tater tots or fries for the kids. But oh my goodness I want to use this for everything. I like to think of this as a personal sized convection oven on steroids. Veggie burgers crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Roasted vegetables, fish sticks, chicken, burgers, fries, fish all with about 30-40% shorter cook times than the oven and only a 3 minute preheat time (vs 6-10 oven minutes).This would be perfect for dorms or couples who want to eat something other than microwaved mush. It\'s also perfect for families who want a better way to make ""fried"" sides like fries, mozzarella sticks, or chicken strips. The clean up is so much easier than cookie sheets. The tub and the browning air fry tray both have a very nice non stick coating making cleanup as simple as a rinse and a wipe.So cons... hmm that\'s a hard one. The biggest cons are that you may want to get a few extra kitchen tools like silicon tipped tongs to toss or flip your food and maybe a small 7"" pan for baking if you like the idea of making this your primary oven too. Also you will need to get a feel for how much faster this cooks so you don\'t overcook your food, but checking on the food is easy and just a peak away. Once you get your timing right setting the controls is super easy and the timer turns it off automatically and you don\'t have to worry about a lot of carry over heat like you do in an oven.OVERALL... I highly recommend it, the Ninja controls are just as simple and intuitive on this as it is on my Ninja blender, it super easy to clean, and it cooks nearly everything fabulously.\n', '\n  I have many ninja products in my home and I love all of them! I am sorry to say I was very disappointed with that strong smell of rubber when I use the ninja air fryer.  It left a toxic smell throughout my home.  My daughter came home and asked if I burnt something rubber.  Needless to say I returned it.  I was not aware of the rubber parts inside of the fryer when I purchase this\n', '\n  Ayer por la tarde estaba cocinando unas alitas de pollo en la air fryer como muchas otras veces y de la nada se apagó y no ha vuelto a prender. Tiene 6 meses que la compré y no es de uso diario, solamente los fines de semana ocasionalmente. No he podido encontrar en la página como contactar al vendedor para preguntar por la garantía o por un centro de servicio. Estaba muy contenta con ella ya todo se cocina a la perfección, pero al parecer se ha muerto después de solo 6 meses.\n', '\n  En realidad quisiera decir que es un producto maravilloso, durante todo el tiempo que la utilizamos estuvimos fascinados con la freidora de aire, sin embargo la compra la realizamos en julio del 2019 y en marzo del 2020 se descompuso, comenzó a oler a quemado y continuamente no volvió a encender.Quisiera saber si existe algún tipo de garantía para hacerla válida\n', '\n  En general fue una buena compra, pero siendo muy honesta los alimentos al no tener aceite sí salen secos por lo que no saben tan tan ricos... sin embargo, es muy práctico preparar el pescado o el pollo en la freidora, si tus alimentos son frescos (no congelados) te recomiendo que bajes la temperatura que sugieren en el manual (ejemplo de 350° a 300°) porque sino se te queman muy rápido y  que al cabo de unos 5 - 10 minutos máximo  monitorees los alimentos para 1. moverlos, 2. saber si es necesario bajar aún más la temperatura o 3. saber si es necesario agotar el tiempo programado o ya parar la cocción. Todo es  cuestión de práctica y de aprender a utilizar esa mínima cantidad de aceite correctamente para que los alimentos no salgan tan secos.Recomiendo el producto.\n', '\n  Me encantó\n', '\n  \xa0Hasta ahora, sumamente amigable. No hay defecto. La desempaqué con mucho cuidado para no tener problema.Limpié e instale, procedí a utilizarla.Al principio me asustó qué pedía Corriente de electricidad 120, Y para mi 110 es lo normal.Sin problema, funciona perfecto además de rápido.Hasta ahora lo único que puedo decirles es que la recomiendo ampliamente. Estoy encantada.\n']"
