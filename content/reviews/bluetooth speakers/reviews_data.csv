This compact speaker packs a punch. it has a clean and wide sound stage and more base than my 10 inch sony speakers, even better than my iPad pro 10 Pro speakers, but it lacks in surround sound though.Pairing this mini bluetooth speaker was very simple and easy, just hold the M button on the speaker and it enters pairing more and it paired right away with my iPhone and my PC, in order to pair it with something else just hold the M button again and it will enter pairing mode again.Some things that this speaker can do, is when you short press the M, it will answer phone, hang up or long press ignore and other things like skip song on Spotify and on my iPhone 12 pro max, it shows the battery charge percentage and it has several dedicated buttons to control the media player in case you're using anything other than phones.Build quality is very good, the speaker feels very premium in hand, and the packaging is beautiful and very giftable in my opinion. Regarding signal coverage, it was still playing music as far as 56 feet away from my iPhone, which is decent for such a small foot print speakers. It has rubber pads to avoid rattle if you're planning to place it on hard flat surface.Overall, great little Bluetooth speaker better than I expected and I highly recommend it.P.S. I hope you like my little video show case!\n"", '\n  I have purchased a few MusiBaby Bluetooth portable speakers in the past and liked them very much. The M71 portable speaker is small and compact but packs a lot of speaker power. After reading the instructions, I found the “M” button was the on/off power button. Connecting via Bluetooth to my iPhone 12 was easy and took no effort at all. The sound quality was clear, loud and easy to control on my phone and M71 device. Making and receiving calls were easy and provided good quality.\n', '\n  When I received this package of Bluetooth speaker... my mind is.....man, so small the bass must be weak..... After I charge the speaker and connect with my phone....wow, I was so surprised....its sound is so clear....and the bass is deep enough, unbelievable. Suddenly, I love it so much because it is much easier for me to carry every where and the battery last pretty long.\n', '\n  So I got the M88 MusiBaby a few weeks ago and I loved it. And I saw you could pair this M71 speaker with it. I decided to get it also. Because I loved the battery life and sound on the M88.The pictures I posted of the M71 are next to a 32oz cup so you could see the size, next to something.The speakers sound really good together when they are paired. It did take me a few attempts to get them paired up. I kept missing a step somewhere, just being in a hurry to see how it sounded.Sound is very clear and I always crank a speaker to see if it gets distorted. By itself the M71 has a clean ,clear sound, to me it had more quite a bit of treble. With the M88, it has more bass, so the speakers sound really good together.I like this speaker for the size, sound and battery. I love having the option to now have 2 speakers linked and in different rooms. Dont be afraid to crank it up, because there is a warranty card in the speaker box.I always go into the EQ settings on my phone or device. Check to see what settings I have it on. I have found that this can make the world of difference finding the best sound for any speaker or headset. I havent tested the water resistance yet, I will be using this speaker alot in my kitchen. So I am sure it will be tested soon.\n', '\n  * A small portable speaker to carry with you.* We are using it on our patio while relaxing in the evening around the fireplace. We mostly play soft and soulful music and this gives a very clear sound.* Connection options are through Bluetooth or Aux. * Bluetooth connections work well with a 30-40 ft distance also. (it claims that will work till 100ft)* Splash proof so you can use it around the bathtub also.* Comes with a USB charging cable & Aux cable.** I have a few different brands of speakers and with this price and size, this speaker is great.\n', ""\n  I recently bought multiple speakers this year, including the one from a known brand to place it on each room in the house. The sound quality of this speaker really surprised me. I wasn't expecting the sound quality to be good because of the price range and size of the speaker. The thing I like the most are I can play my mp3 collections using USB Flash Drive and SD Card.\n"", ""\n  Set pair with my phone was a breeze. I have Spotify and Sirius XM on my phone, so I have access to almost limitless music and shows on my phone. Sound quality is great! You can bring up the volume and for this speaker alone, can provide ample sound volume if you are having a medium sized party inside or out. And you can't go wrong with the price. I highly recommend.\n"", ""\n  I've been using this Bluetooth speaker to listen to music from Youtube on my phone.  The sound quality is excellent.  The volume easily fills my home office better than many larger speakers.  I have also listened to it outside and the sound carries very well.  I have listened to rock, country and classical music and they all sound rich and full.  The bass is great, and the treble is crisp and clean.  This speaker is better than any other speaker its size that I have heard.\n""]"

It STILL WORKS. Even in its smashed up state nothing broke but the speaker cover protector. So bravo JBL, this is a great product.

It's especially frustrating because probably the most important part of the product -- how good it sounds -- is not something you can really evaluate until after you physically have it.

How useful can it be? On the other hand they didn\'t modify the volume of the switching On/Off sound, which is stupidly loud.

As a result I ended up with more of them than most dealers, speakers of every possible shape and gimmick. Some of them were knock your socks off impressive, including some so small I could stuff them in my carry on when I traveled so I could have music in my hotel rooms.These days there are a handful left from the major brands. One of them I was curious about was this series from Cambridge SoundWorks, a company I’ve known and respected since I worked directly with their founder Henry Kloss back in the late 80’s and early 90’s. Unlike the early days of Bluetooth mini speakers this little speaker was only nineteen bucks, probably the lowest I’ve ever paid for any speaker. I had mixed expectations. But I chose it both for its size and its shape, I was looking for a small personal speaker to put on the base of my desktop monitor to be able to listen to content at low volume without using my high-end Boston Acoustics system.The small size is truly impressive as is the surprisingly nice look and feel of the speaker. It is heavier than similar no name speakers and you almost have to wonder how they can sell it for such a low price. It comes with a micro USB charging cable and also a mini audio cable. The power switch is easily reached near the top of the back of the speaker where the audio input and charging port are also located behind a rubber flap. The rest of the controls are on the right side of the wedge.The speaker will pair easily with newer Bluetooth devices but it seems it is not 100% compatible with all of the many standards. For example it would not pair with my desktop computer without downloading an updated Bluetooth driver.The most important thing you probably want to know is how does it sound. I’m sorry to say that with almost 20,000 review written already, many of them high energy endorsements, I’m not as impressed. I have definitely heard better from similar sized, and even smaller, speakers. It’s not bad, but it’s not knock your socks off impressive. And it’s definitely not a speaker that you would choose if there were more than one or two listeners or for use outdoors.There are a couple of things to be aware of that I liked – one is that if you use the audio cable the speaker won’t shut off automatically after a few minutes like many other brands do, but it will shut off after 15 minutes of non-playing when used in the Bluetooth mode.  Interestingly, if you pair it with an Echo device the power stays on all the time in battery mode so you would probably want to keep it plugged in to a power source if that’s your plan.I also like that you only hear the pairing sound once the first time unlike many other brands that make a loud sound whenever they are powered on or when pairing is successful. For me that is a deal breaker.\n', '\n  I did a lot of research before choosing this speaker. I was impressed by the large number of 5 star buyer ratings. The price was excellent as well. Speaker came packaged perfectly. Included was a 3 foot Micro-USB charging cable and 3 foot 3.5mm audio cable; I wish these were longer but that is just my personal preference. Speaker came partially charged. Instructions states it can be used while charging. Speaker pairs easily and quickly, but I did experience problems getting it to disconnect from one device to pair to a different source. I contacted the company and they were quick to respond back to me. Their customer service was excellent, fast, relevant and courteous. They even offered to call me to assure that the device was working properly or not. After working with it a few days the device started working as expected and has not had an issue ever since. Maybe it was user error? Not sure. I also ordered the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS. The Angle 3 PLUS offers 30 hours of playtime vs the Angle 3 which only offers 7 hours (a big difference). The Angle 3 PLUS is a tad taller at 6 1/2"". The Angle 3 is 5 1/4"", see attached photos. I didn\'t notice a sound quality difference but my musician son did. He ordered the 3 PLUS and says it is a better speaker than his Jawbone Bluetooth Speaker for less than half the cost. I use the smaller speaker, which sets on a high shelf in my shower, as it is water resistant & splash proof. The other sets on my office desk. If you are considering purchasing a Bluetooth speaker definitely consider the OontZ. I would go for the Angle 3 PLUS as the price difference is only about $7 unless a smaller speaker is your goal. I have referred several people to this powerful little speaker and all are very happy with their purchase.\n', ""\n  Best speaker I've ever purchased. Great sound, loud, battery lasts longer than any other speaker I've had. 4 months later, we ran it over - twice with Chevy 2500 & then the trailer. :( GUESS WHAT! It still works! INCREDIBLE! I wish I could upload a video. Just bought 2 more!\n"", ""\n  \xa0I have had an issue (up until now) of being able to hear the TV while in the kitchen.  In order to hear it, I needed to turn it WAAAYYYYY up, but then it's too loud for people sitting in front of the TV.  Connecting one Oontz speaker with a cord (not supplied) to the back of the TV eliminates lipsynch issues and then pairing a second speaker to the first one allows me to place it in the kitchen.  Problem solved!  The included directions made this a very easy process!  There are A LOT of wireless, bluetooth speakers out there that are garbage.  These Oontz speakers ARE NOT one of those!  Amazing flexibility and sound!\n"", '\n  I received the speaker today and within 24 hours of ordering it.  It came neatly boxed and with comprehensive and easy to read instructions.  Easy enough to connect and I am blown away by the quality of sound.  It is amazing such a small speaker can  produce such deep, excellent and faithful sound.It feels quality by its weight and finish and the design is better than the standard rectangular box.  I would recommend this speaker and my only complaint is regarding the position of the AUX cable in.  The AUX socket could have been situated lower down in order to hide the sight of the jack and associated cable coming out of the rear of the speaker at high level. A small compromise for otherwise perfect sound reproduction.  So far so good and I look forward to continue to listen to its delightful tones\n', ""\n  Love it when I get a product that exceeds my expectations. I needed a little speaker for my desk at work on the night shift. Didn't need to blow the roof off with loudness. Just to do the job.Tried others, but the sound was a little too quiet. This speaker is unexpectedly loud (if you require that) even has bass. Great sound quality and even has a cool simple design that looks good.For such a compact speaker I'm impressed. Battery/charge life I keep mine plugged in usually so I may not be the best review to give you an accurate reading on this. But I've had it out for several hours, over three. Pretty loud and have not run out of charge.Great product. Very happy.\n"", ""\n  Purchased for £19.99 and primarily for playback of music and podcasts in a small office.This is a very neat and compact unit with easily accessible buttons and covered USB slot.It's too early to comment on charge longevity, but I'll update this if I have any issues.As expected with a 10w speaker, it's capable of reproducing sound at high volume without loss of quality, and even though I don't generally have it loud, it passed that test.As expected, the sound quality of the Angle 3 is an improvement on my Surface Pro speaker (which actually isn't bad for a tiny built in speaker), though you're generally just getting a bit more body and volume.It's really worth trying it on different surfaces as it can make a big difference to the sound quality.In the first few days of use, I have occasionally had a poor Bluetooth connection when switching it on, resulting in the sound breaking up. Each time though, switching the speaker off and back on has resolved the issue.I didn't really get this for portability, but it's an obvious advantage to be able to port whatever I'm listening to around the house uninterrupted. I haven't really tested the range, but again, I'll update this if I encounter any issues.I think for it's simplicity and power, it's pretty good value for money and I'm very pleased with it.\n"", '\n  I’ve yet to see this on sale at the RRP of £99.99. I paid £24.99 for it, and I think the sound quality is great. I bought it for a couple of reasons. 1st for when I do presentations on my MacBook Pro to small groups. I wanted some better than just relying on the internal speaks of my laptop for any audio content. 2nd, when I go away, I want to pair my phone to listen to music whilst I sit the the hotel bedroom.Positives: for the price I paid, the sound quality is very good. Dynamic enough for my wide musical tastes (EDM, rock, pop, classical), and also for spoken word for my presentation. Battery life is good. Easy to recharge. Splashproof/showerproof for in a shower (although I’ve yet to try that). No problem connecting via Bluetooth on all my devices both Apple bases and PC.Negative: minor as it is, it doesn’t fill a big room like Sonos does, but then, it’s a quarter of the price of Sonos.I would have written a 3 star if I’d paid the RRP\n', '\n  I bought this in November 2018, but am reviewing now after a lot of heavy use.  The thing probably gets around 50-70 hours of play time a week.  It always connects to bluetooth, has a decent range, and sounds great.We have multiple phones that connect, and you just need to press the bluetooth button on the side for it to look again for the closest device.I am happy with the battery life; it seems like we rarely need to charge it.Its a small speaker so it is handy to travel with or bring from room to room.I would happily buy another.\n']"

I love the sound of this speaker. Gets plenty loud for its size.  2. I can get my phone over 100 feet away from speaker and have zero signal issues.  3. Battery life is great.Cons: Only 1 thing bothers me about this product. When battery gets low the speaker makes a phone busy signal type sound every minute or so letting you know battery is almost dead. Trouble is I have had this speaker make the low battery tone for over an hour before getting so annoyed with the intermittent tone I just turned off the speaker.(NOTE TO DOSS) PLEASE! Remove low battery tone from this product. It is not needed. If you must indicate low battery make the led ring flash red or something. Please NO annoying tones.\n', '\n  I just received this last night so I can only make an initial review. Ita adorable and THE MAIN REASON I am make such a hasty review....I recall many of the reviews I read stating that your device did not affect the volume so I was really disappointed in the output of this speaker.... UNTIL I decided to turn up the volume on my iphone 6.  WHOAAAA! Amazing sound. I was able to wander around 40 feet before loosing bluetooth coverage. So far I am very pleased. If there are issues down the road I will update but just wanted to inform reviewers about the volume info\n', ""\n  What a wonderful speaker! First off, the packaging it comes with is very nice and it comes with a micro USB charging cable, an AUX cord, and a waterproof protective sleeve for the speaker! As for the sound quality, beyond superb. The built-in sub-woofer gives amazing bass for how much and how big the speaker is. The battery life is very long and it doesn't take too long to charge. Another thing I really like about this speaker is the fact that the volume control is touch-controlled rather than just buttons. Overall, amazing bluetooth speaker for the price and if anyone is reading this right now, BUY IT!!!\n"", '\n  \xa0I\'ll update in a few weeks! But my initial reaction is WOW. For the price the sound is great. The base is not bad either. I can feel it on the floor from where i was standing.Only ""con"" when you reach max volume the music pauses for like 2-3 seconds, meanwhile the speakers will play a tune, to let you know max volume. Why cant the tune play over the music?\n', '\n  I\'d purchased this ""stereo"" speaker primarily because of the available option to play my music via the SD card slot. Less hassle not having to use my phone. As luck would have it the unit that I received was defective in that one option. It would not play via the SD card. I e-mailed their tech support and received a reply within an hour. I tried several different size SD cards formatted with FAT & FAT32 and trying a specific song they had me download the SD card still would not work. It worked fine via bluetooth and even the AUX connection. So all within a couple of hours of e-mail exchanges they determined it was defective (hey, it happens) and immediately shipped me out a replacement. Couple days later I received the replacement and the SD card in this one worked fine. THANKS to Milla for the great tech support!!! Ok, after using the speaker I can highly recommend it! It has very good sound for the price. I wish I had this when I still worked and had a small AM/FM/CD radio to listen to. For it\'s size it\'s got some hefty weight to it. The controls are ""BRIGHTLY"" illuminated and responsive. It has 4 rubber feet on the base that if it\'s placed on a smooth surface it will practically stick in place and not slide should you push it. It can play very loud and in my use the loudest for my liking is half volume. It comes with a water proof drawstring pouch for storage/carrying, both an AUX cable and cable for USB charging either via PC or phone charger. I am currently playing it at my desk as I write this review where I used to play music thru my PC. Using the SD card for music, when you shut off the speaker it remembers where you left off in the cue or mid song next time you turn it back on. If you like the convenience having the SD card & not dealing with your phone/tablet via bluetooth this is soooo convenient. Edit: Someone asked this so FYI songs play by title alphabetically from the card. I\'d never even noticed and assumed it was random until I checked to respond to the question. As for the option to answer your phone with this I haven\'t tested it and quite frankly can\'t see using it if you\'re among others like an outdoor barbecue or the beach where all can hear your conversation.\n', '\n  \xa0\n', ""\n  I purchased this to connect with my Amazon Dot. I wanted a nice sounding bluetooth speaker that doesn't break the bank and would have decent sound.  Purchasing this was a great choice and I would highly suggest purchasing this product if you are in the market for a great sounding portable speaker.The addition of using a micro sd card to play music is nice. However, this unit really shines with the touch controls.  Reminds me of the classic iPod with volume, mode, and skipping tracks.  It's very smooth and intuitive to touch.Sound wise you will be amazed at that sound coming from a speaker that is less than $100.\n"", '\n  Very pleased with purchase.  I spent a lot of time looking for the right speaker and reading reviews.  Of course I would like to purchase Bose devices but they are not within the budget I was looking for.  I wanted a device that I could connect to my Echo Dot and also take out of the house and use with my phone for music.  I am pleased to say that this satisfied all of my requirements and I was extremely pleased with the sound quality which I am very particular about. All in all, great quality all round!\n', '\n  The first one of these that I ordered would unpredictably skip Spotify tracks when Bluetooth connected from iPhone. Returned the product and ordered a new one. No problems at all.

I finally bought it and love it! It sounds really great but I have used it’s for less than a month and I left it charging for 6 hours because I was going camping and when I got to camp it hadn’t charge, I thought my cable wasn’t working but I have charged other devices with it and worked perfect. I put it to charge today for 4 hours and when Ari turned it on it said “battery low” and shut off. I am kind of disappointed with this speaker. Specially because I have been wanting to get it’s for this long!\n', '\n  I was surprised in every way upon the Sound Link Color II\'s arrival, connection and playback of music.To start with, the instructions were so poor, it made us wonder if we bought a fake from China.  We later found an online manual, and wondered why it was not included with our speaker.  Not to worry though, we had a lengthy set of safety precautions in twenty-one, I kid you not - twenty-one, different languages.Bose is a great name, right?  Every Bose product we have ever listened to exceeded expectations and most of the time left us in awe.  My wife and I listened to the Sound Touch 10 (cousin of Sound Link?) in Sam\'s and were thinking the Sound Link Color II would be just as amazing.  It\'s not - the Sound Link Color II sound is just average.  It is a little better than our four year old Phillips speaker, but comes no where near matching the sound of our two year old Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker.  The speaker\'s bass is nearly non-existent, and it will not play as loud as either of the two other speakers we compared it with.  The absence of the Bose ""wow!"" left us very disappointed.  Looking through the manual we found online, Bose indicates the speaker works best when backed up close to, but not against, a wall.  An odd piece of guidance given Bose\'s advertisement of the speaker as an on the go, outside, camping/swimming/party speaker.  We did try the guidance though, and it did seem to add a little more bass.  But not nearly enough to overcome the speaker\'s sound shortcomings.The rubbery speaker exterior is nice - some reviewers indicated it was a lint/dust trap, but we did not find it such.  It felt good, provided a solid feel and seemed consistent with the speaker\'s water resistant claim.The speaker has a VERY annoying feature when charging - it beeps every 15-20 seconds or so.  We could not find a way to turn the beep off anywhere in the Bose literature.  Online, we found this irritant was very common and can be fixed by using a non-Bose micro USB cable.  And indeed, the online fix eliminated the problem.  Not a big deal cost-wise, but the flippin\' cable has Bose\'s name on it!  This is Bose for Pete\'s sake, you expect better.The app was a non factor.  Not useful, not a problem.  It was much easier to go Settings/Bluetooth, connect to the Bose Sound Link Color II and then play music from your music library.  The app has no features, other than perhaps it\'s stereo/party mode where you need two Sound Link Color II speakers.  Yeah right, like that\'s gonna happen.This was a VERY disappointing buy.  I spent an embarrassing amount of Black Friday and Cyber Monday time looking for any kind of deal on the Sound Link Color II - to no avail.  I reasoned it was Bose, and the sound would more than compensate for a few dollars.  Bad call on my part.  I bought our Harmon Kardon Onyx a couple of years ago via a Black Friday deal.  It cost less than the Sound Link Color II and yet dramatically outperforms the Bose.A disappointing speaker, and not worth the Bose premium in my opinion.\n', '\n  I bought this to pair with an Echo Dot.  Setup was very easy - almost effortless.  Sound is much better than what the Dot, or even the full-sized Echo, can produce, and I am very pleased with its performance.Deducted one star because it comes with a charging cable only - the wall plug is not included.  I\'m guessing their theory is that it will be charged by a computer and used on the go.  And, yes, ""everyone"" has a wall plug anyway.  But to package a product without all necessary accessories is just not right.\n', '\n  Don’t buy this!  I bought this in mid-January 2018 & within a month the power just went dead. It wouldn’t charge no matter what connecton I used. Looked on the net for help & found that dozens of other folks have experienced the same problem. Some were able to eventually get it to work again, but many, like me, couldn’t.  I also have the original Bose Sound Link & that still works great after more than a year. I highly recommend that over the Sound Link II.\n', '\n  J\'ai quelques enceintes Bluetooth dans les 50 euros, Phillips et Sony et d\'autres chinoiseries encore moins chères.Pour l\'usage que j\'en fais, ça me suffisait. Je ne vais pas dans la piscine avec l\'enceinte et le gros ""boom boom ""ce n’est pas trop ma tasse de thé, surtout avec le genre de musique que j\'écoute habituellement.Mais voilà, un jour une amie se ramène avec une ""Bose SoundLink Micro""Ça tombe bien, j\'entends parler de Bose par ci, de Bose par là, alors c\'est l\'occasion de comparer.Avant même de se faire la bise, on décide de tester les enceintes. Oui bon, ben chacun s\'amuse comme il veut ... ;)Ma meilleure enceinte Bluetooth est la Sony SRS-XB10L. On va la comparer avec la Bose et là toutes mes certitudes sont balayées. Ma brave Sony est humiliée c\'est vrai que la ""Bose"" coûte plus de fois plus cher.Bon, enchanté, je me décide donc a investir dans les 120 € et j\'achète la Bose Soudlink Color II dont il est question ici.Je ne suis pas déçu , c\'est une enceinte à la belle finition, du lourd !Alors c\'est donc ça les fameuses enceintes du Docteur Bose?Pour commencer- L’ergonomie n\'est pas le point fort de cette enceinte. En effet, pourquoi ne pas indiquer clairement le niveau de la batterie comme sur sa petite sœur la ""Bose micro"" ? Sur celle ci il faut observer au démarrage, si c\'est vert blanc ou je ne sais quoi. On ne sait donc pas vraiment ou en est la charge de la batterie.- Les invites vocales sont inaudibles car la voix est nasillarde et surtout la vitesse d’élocution est trop élevée.- Les boutons sur le dessus de l\'objet ne sont pas particulièrement lisibles dans l\'obscurité , Bose aurait pu ajouter un éclairage rapide lors de l\'appui sur une touche.Et ce qui nous intéresse le plus.- Niveau ""musical"" ou plutôt niveau basses évidemment ça dépote, mais ce n\'est pas très fin, on ne fait pas dans la dentelle.  C\'est un Sumo dans un magasin de porcelaine.Si c\'est parfait pour écouter ""Tush"" ou ""Beer drinkers & Hell Raisers"" de ZZ Top ou ""Lucille"" de Little Richard par exemple, à mon avis ce n\'est pas du tout adapté à la musique plus progressive comme ""A trick of The Tail"" de Genesis , """"Dark Side of the moon de Pink Flyod"" et encore moins à ""Rock Bottom"" de Robert Wyatt.- Par ailleurs ce genre d\'enceintes est très sensible à la source.Avec du Mp3 qu\'il soit encodé à 192 kbit/s  avec Lame ou le codec Ogg Vorbis ou Wma  ça ne donne pas de très bons résultats, il faut au moins de l\'encodage à 320 kbit/s, si ce n\'est du FLAC  pour profiter de certains albums, autant dire que sur les plate formes de musique en ligne les plus connues ça n\'existe pas pour des raisons évidentes d’économies de bande passante. A l’exception notable de ""Qobuz.""Finalement, je suis un peu réservé sur cette BOSE , je m\'attendais à beaucoup mieux, mais c\'est juste histoire de râler un peu. Est-elle 2 fois et demie plus performante, (comme son prix), que ma petite Sony  ?Pas sur, en tous cas elle a plus de coffre,  mais quoi qu\'il en soit, je n\'utilise plus que la Bose maintenant, objectivement c\'est quand même la preuve qu\'elle est bien supérieure à ce que j\'avais déjà écouté.- Pour résumer, ça va bien pour de la variétés internationale , de la danse ou du reggae. Mais pour la finesse on repassera.Pour écouter mes albums préférés dans de bonnes conditions rien ne vaut mon ampli Yamaha et ma vieille paire de Celestion Ditton. Mais ce n\'est pas aisément transportable. ;)Par contre, pour écouter sur Spotify ou autres alors c\'est une enceinte adaptée.Merci, ma copine, de m\'avoir fait dépenser encore de l\'argent dans du matériel pas forcement vital.Mais bon qu\'est ce qu\'on ""rigole"" !Allez on se met ""Go"" de Moby , et en avant, on se croirait presque sur un ""Danse Floor"" ;)\n', ""\n  Bought this device as I always wanted to buy Bose speakers. Speaker sound definitely justifies the brand.However, the firmware will surely ruin it all. It's one of the most buggy software I have ever used.In last year I have seen all these issues almost every month -1) The speaker suddenly stops powering on. No matter what you do (including fw reset as specified on support), it will just not start. And then after a few days, it starts working like magic. Seen this trice in last one year.2) Sometimes after (1), it powers on somehow but does not connect to any device.3) Now the recent update has bought most amazing feature. The device doesn't turn off. Pressing any key (including power) results into device clearing it's bluetooth device list and then keeps saying 'Ready To Connect'. It has not powered off for last two days :-DOn top of this, support website is pure joke. Didn't even receive acknowledgement for the issue after posting it.I always wanted to have Bose speaker and had their home theatre on my wishlist. But now I am no sure. If they can not write bug-free firmware for such a small speaker, home theatre is too tough job for them.\n"", ""\n  I bought this for travel so I can have my music in my hotel room but I've ended up using it at home as well as my main speaker for all my music as it is THAT GOOD!!! LOVE IT!!!UPDATE:  I have dropped this to two stars because the unit suddenly stopped taking a charge - apparently a known issue that is widespread and can be remedied in most cases with a series of plugging and unplugging the unit while holding down various buttons.  Not working for me.  VERY VERY unhappy about this.\n"", ""\n  The speaker worked for a little while and now will not charge or turn on at all. Save the extra money and don't buy a Bose product. I thought Bose was supposed to be good quality. My daughter's cheaper speaker is similar in sound quality and charges every time. My next speaker will not be a Bose. I will not buy Bose again, I will buy a cheaper brand name and save myself well over one hundred dollars\n"", ""\n  I have been using a BOSE Soundlink Mini ii for sometime now in my room and am still amazed when I play anything through it.  So much so that I was looking to buy another for in the bedroom to save me carrying it around and relinking it to different devices. They are no longer available, so I bought this instead.  Glad I did.I spent almost as much time unpacking it as setting it up.. Doddle.It sounds great straight out of the box, and this will get even better as it runs in.  It doesn't have quite the depth or separation between the ranges that the Mini has, but then the Mini cost a lot more.  The Color is weighty and well built and a really engaging listen.  If I need another speaker I will  buy this model again without hesitation.One thing I have found is that the Mini sounds best with its' back four to six inches from a wall (it projects sound backward as well as forward) whereas the Color comes into it's own in free space (it projects sound forward mainly).  Both however will benefit from not sitting directly on wood or melamine (shelves, desks etc), although glass is good.Update - the Soundlink 11 is back on the market so I bought another.  Son now has the Color and he's over the moon with the sound and that he can take it into the shower room as it is water resistant.\n""]"

The Bose Micro, although very small, had really poor quality sound for the price (most disappointing).\n', '\n  Wowowow. So glad I made this purchase. Tested this little guy out on a camping trip this past weekend and it blew us all away. Its small, light weight, and with the bright blue color I picked, super easy to find when you\'re rummaging around in your tent. The sound on this thing is really impressive. Really clear sound and nice bass for something so little. Plus it can get REALLY loud.  We have a Google Home and Google Home mini at home and the UE Wonderboom has way better sound then the Mini. Plus, portability is a no brainer. Love that it has the loop on top to attach to a backpack.My only con to the wonderboom is battery indicator. When I received it, I looked up the manual and said that you hold the volume up + volume down on the unit to hear a ""tone"" that will indicate what the battery level is at. That there is a High, Medium and Low tone. Well I had no idea what tone I was hearing when I pushed the buttons. I was googling like crazy trying to hear/understand which tone the device was at. Charged it over night and realized what the difference was: The ""High"" battery tone has three little chimes that are higher pitch. The ""Medium"" get a little lower in pitch, with two chimes.  And the ""Low"" is deepest in pitch and only has one chime.\n', ""\n  The sound of this speaker is fine.  My issue is with the battery.  I ordered this speaker in August 2017.  I took it on one river float and it stopped turning on.  In fact, it would cycle the startup sound for hours whenever I'd attempt to charge it and turn it on so I just stopped charging it.I got a replacement order about a week later.  This speaker worked fine for a handful of floating excursions, but after the last one a few weeks ago, it does not accept a charge.  I've plugged multiple chargers into the port and the white light never turns on.  Anytime I try to turn it on it blinks red and makes the sad dead sound.  This speaker is not as waterproof as I thought and is therefore worthless to me.\n"", '\n  Very impressed with the sound/size ratio for this speaker.  In fact I dithered between 4 and 5 stars, but the sound for the size is so good I went with five in spite of some minor issues (no audio in and determining battery level is not simple)I actually dropped it accidently from counter height to a tile floor and it was fine.The giant plus and vertical line are the volume control buttons.The waterproof claim does NOT mean you can actually float it around in your pool (you can have it immersed one meter (about 3 feet) underwater for 30 minutes) but it does float. Make sure you close the little rubber door that has the USB charger input before getting it wet.I would not use this in a shower directly,  it has a pattern to the surface that collects soap scum.  I was able to scrub this off, but it is a bit annoying.Tap the UE button once to play or hit pause. Press again to resume the track. Tap it twice to skip to the next song. Long press it to sync with another nearby Wonderboom speaker.. Press again to resume the track.Pairing was simple, paired with a Chromebook and an android phone with no trouble.  For the Chromebook it would stay connected about 40 feet (through walls), with the phone it was about 30 feet.  Line of sight worked for at least 60 feet.A total of three trials, playing at full volume (to test it)  the battery lasted  6 hours,  5.5 hours and a little over 6 hours.  I am sure it would last longer at a lower volume.You can push both volume buttons at the same time and it gives you an audio tone to tell you it is it “high” charge which is a series of notes of increasing pitch,  “medium” charge which is a couple of tones, and “low” which is a series of decreasing pitch notes.You cannot tell the battery level visually.  The directions said 2.8 hours, so I left it 3 hours it was still giving me the “medium tone""After five hours I got the “high” charge.  I am not a fan of this sort of battery indicator.You cannot tell the battery level visually.  The directions said 2.8 hours, so I left it for 3 and it seemed fully charged but again, there is no visual indicator.  After 2.8 hours it was still giving me the “medium” tone.  After five hours I got the “high” charge.  I am not a fan of this sort of battery indicator. I also would really like an audio jack,  I have a couple other Bluetooth speakers and both have this option. It uses less power from the device being used to play it, and I can also use them with my Sansa Clip that does not have Bluetooth.\n', ""\n  Thought them to be cute little admission to my house but boy they pack a serious stuff inside them!.

I  ordered a few but had to return or cancel them due to poor sound or incompatibility issues.After going through a rigorous process lasting many days, I  ordered UE WONDERBOOM. It's simply spectacular at its current price - Rs 4500. Deep bass which does not drown the mids, clarity beyond compare, connects to two devices -my iPhone and Echo Dot, ultra portable, 10 hour battery life. It sits comfortably in a gap in my bed board and the stereo sound sounds so melodious. The important thing is that you need stereo to get the perfect sound. Normally, in such small packages you get a single speaker and a bass radiator. This has two speakers, two bass radiators AND 360 degree sound. What more can anyone ask for?\n"", ""\n  Boom bada boom, I feel sometimes the bass overpowers other frequencies but still the sound is quiet airy and enjoyed it. Plus it's sound if not as clear as JBL flip 4 it just doesn't get harsh as flip high range which sometimes becomes harsh and tiering when listening for a long time. This is for easy listening just hope it had some controller for the bass level. Wonderboom doesn't come with an app I have no idea why . Atleast you have an equilizer with an app. That said the sound it delivers is very good, fuller, airy, crisp and sometimes overpowering but tight bass. Only to nit-pick you cannot take call on this speaker and you can do that on flip.8th Oct exactly two years after purchasing this speaker it is still working fine. I will buy one more the fun part is the price is still the same even after two years 😅.\n"", ""\n  I did a lot of research before plonking my money on it. The sound clarity is awesome. My rooms are quite big and this guy fills it completely with good quality sound. The spread of sound is very good too. I'm a complete bass head and have a Sony SRS D9 as main sound system and Sony MDR XB55 AP as earphone. So, I know my bass and sound quality. Wonderboom is not at all bass heavy but it's all about portable good quality sound. If you compare with proper wood cabinets with woofers you will be disappointed but see it for what it is and you will be happy. It's a good quality portable speaker incomparable in this price range.\n""]"
