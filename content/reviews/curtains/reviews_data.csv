Honestly I wasn‚Äôt expecting a lot for $27. The material is soft and hangs well. No funky odors or chemical smell. I chose the Jungle Green color and I think it‚Äôs a beautiful color and represented well by the color on screen. It does make the room quite a bit darker than the curtains I previously had, but I wouldn‚Äôt call them ‚Äúblack out‚Äù curtains. However, they offer the perfect amount of darkening for me. Our previous curtains kept the room too bright for our baby to settle down for nap and these work just right. Our windows are unshaded and south facing so they get blasted with light and you can see from my pictures that the curtains work really well to cut the brightness a lot.My only disappointment with these is that the backside of the curtain is the same color, meaning that all that sunlight is absorbed into the dark curtain fabric and they get HOT. It holds the heat a lot more than it would have if the backside had been a lighter color (say a cream or beige). So I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call these thermal curtains. That said, I think that the daytime room temperature has actually gone down from when we had our other curtains and I haven‚Äôt noticed a night chill at all (my bed is directly underneath the windows) so I think they do offer a certain degree of insulation - much better than our old set of curtains. Also, I would have rather had fabric tie backs than these metallic tassel ones, but that‚Äôs just personal preference.Overall, I‚Äôm very impressed with them and plan on buying more sets for the rest of our home. I don‚Äôt think you can beat them for the price.\n', '\n  Nice quality.  Tumble dry to remove wrinkles quickly.  The yellow is very bright .... French‚Äôs Mustard yellow.  I was expecting a bit Less intense color but the color worked quite well.\n', '\n  We have been battling our neighbors motion light for years, I have tried all kinds curtains and blinds. I bought these a couple of weeks ago and these curtains are the best, we have had some major winds the past couple of weeks which usually means a light show all night long, with these curtains there was no light coming through, our bedroom was like a dark cave. I wish I had these curtains when I use to worked the midnight shifts. The price is great and they work as advertised.\n', ""\n  The curtains are lovely. Beautiful, soft, and good quality. I love the Orange Red color, exactly what I wanted for my living room. They did come with a few wrinkles, but that wasn't a problem for me. Also, for me, these block out the sun in my living room, which is funny, because I wasn't expecting complete block out from reading other reviews. As you see in the picture, the living room is dark using these curtains, and this was during the day where the sun was it's brightest. This I believe will also help me out temp wise, because the sun use to shine so full and bright in that window, it would warm up my living room quickly. I really love these curtains, and I'm very glad I brought these instead of the other brands I was considering. I will eventually purchase another pair for my bedroom. I would recommend these to others.\n"", ""\n  Second best purchase I have made for my house!! (The 1st was a hot tub) I get morning sun directly in my window, which is fantastic during the week to help me wake up, but on the weekends makes sleeping in completely impossible. I bought a double curtain rod, some sheers for the back and put these on the front. I got the light grey ones, so I expected them to do ok but not necessarily great. They completely block the light - the only reflected light I get is at the top and base of the curtains (since they don't touch the wall). Once the sun passes my window, it gets nearly as dark as night. Super Happy and would absolutely buy again!\n"", ""\n  (The product reviewed is on the left in the above image) These are soft, durable, and of quality material. First I used them in my common areas in the summer to block the cool A/C air from escaping my living room into my non-temperature controlled kitchen. It was successful in this way. Then, after my baby was born, we used them in our bedroom, where we all sleep, because he wouldn't take naps during the day (the 8 week old kid knows light means AWAKE). Amazingly, he'll nap now because these curtains give the illusion that it's night time!! God send. I thought the price was very fair. I paid $20 total, I think, for 2 panels. My only complaint is that I don't think these are emerald green; they are darker and much more of a forest green, which bums me out a bit. Regardless, they've been SO useful, so helpful. Totally recommended.\n"", ""\n  These are good light blockers.  NOT great.  Have used others from WalMart or Target that performed better.  However, I would say these look a lot better than the big box stores version.  The seams appear durable enough, and the grommets are adequately pressed.  There was one little flaw of what appeared to be a mild burned area (?), but it's hidden out of sight.They work well enough and we appreciate the color selection.  The photos are pretty close to the actual material color.\n"", ""\n  Beautiful, rich shade. I bought one set to install on rod between living and dining rooms. I only wish the header on the back side of the grommets was finished with the same fabric as the rest of the drape - the white on the back side of the grommeted header is visible from the dining room, so I had to purchase another set of the same drapes and install the four panels back-to-back on the rod between the two rooms. If the drapes were being hung on windows, the white grommeted backing material on the header would not be visible. Otherwise, the drapes are beautiful, look very expensive, and the dark red shade is very rich-looking. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase.\n"", '\n  Not as Dark as they say &  i wanted I could not return I lost the package got tosses with out me knowing so hear they sit... If i had the package they would have gone back\n', '\n  These drapes are great- definitely keeping the light and cold out. My husband works nights and he can sleep during the day with no problem....it‚Äôs really dark. I bought 2 pair for nice fullness. I haven‚Äôt steamed them yet as I was just anxious to get up and the holidays were upon us. However the wrinkles have fallen out by about 90%. I will still steam- nice and heavy yet satiny feel of this fabric. I got them at a sale price which was a bonus ( not huge sale- but nice) I researched black out drapes for at least 3 hours and chose these. I definitely recommend them. I can‚Äôt believe how they block out the sound as well- we live on the major street in our city!\n', ""\n  Ordered the burgundy curtains and they work perfectly. The picture is a little deceptive.. It almost looks as though there is light streaming in but I swear they block all the light (I think my camera just enhances the light). The curtains are made of a rich, thick, and soft material and block light VERY WELL. Little tip.. Order probably 15-20cm bigger than your window size (width) to help block the bleeding light from the sides of the curtains. I'm very sensitive to light when I sleep and now I sleep like a baby. SO HAPPY with the purchase!\n"", ""\n  Nice and thick and good quality curtains. Would recommend purchasimng and we'll be looking forward to the deals to repurchase again. Yes they block out light and these are light grayüòçNote... check for hole in them, found out of 2 sets there was holes in 2 panel's and see tell hung in sunlight....Flash sale: Other 2 sets have got have pull marks in every panel and has asked for refund...\n"", ""\n  It does seem that over the months our sleep has improved, and our room is definitely warmer than another room that does not have these (yet). I say it's performing very well. It doesn't block out light 100%, but does well enough that you will still be pleased.\n""]"

Pretty true to the picture on the site.Black Out:I‚Äôm not sure what people expect from ‚Äúblack out‚Äù curtains, but these definitely block out a lot of light. Enough for a baby to sleep and more than the picture depicts. If you‚Äôre looking to block out all light I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôd go with a grommet style curtain in the first place. And these are not lined on the back...they‚Äôre lined INSIDE. And I can tell you this because an iron fell and burned one lol. So there is a black plastic-like layer in between two yellow pieces. Be careful when ironing üòâMaterial:I had no issue with ‚Äúsnags‚Äù in any of the 4 panels/2 sets like some other reviews mentioned.

We bought these for my daughters room because it must have poor insulation because its either always hot or always cold, depending on the season.  Once we put thise curtains up, we could already tell a difference in the temp in her room.  Since it is winter right now, we could already feel the curtains keeping the cold from the window out.  Very glad we bought these!\n', ""\n  I live in New England and have a sunroom at the back of my home which is surrounded on 3 sides by windows. I use the room as both an office and entertainment center.  I need curtains that 1) did not cost a fortune; 2) fit my windows; 3)  block the light when watching the television; 4) kept the heat in during the winter.  I bought 7 sets and I am very happy with them.  They were easy to put up, look great, and met all my expectations. Over Christmas, I received many compliments on the room and the curtains.  Couldn't be happier with purchase.\n"", ""\n  Just got my curtains thirty minutes ago. First, I saw the spot on the first curtain as I'm taking it out the package and then as I'm looking down I see where the seams are separating from the material. This is unacceptable!! I ordered another that's due to arrive later today. If it's like anything what I just got, get ready because I want a replacement or a refund.Update!I received the second set of curtains later that day. This set was much better than the first. No separated seams in the material; however, the they are very, very wrinkled. Hubby wants to keep both sets rather than send the other back. I really hate keeping merchandise that is flawed.\n"", '\n  These curtains really darken the room.  The fabric is nice, color was consistent.  I bought 6 and they were all consistent with color and length.\n', '\n  These are amazing! I bought white, so I feared that the light color would not block out the sun. They block out all light! They are a very good quality.\n', '\n  These are amazing.

They are really nice curtains and you get both panels. It‚Äôs a real steal. I highly recommend them! They black out the room better than any of the other brands I have tried for a lot cheaper price.

The curtains are some of the thinnest 'blackout' curtains I've ever owned.  I use a pull-down shade in combination with the curtains, and I do not see much of a difference when I use them together. I hoped the curtains would help block the residual light coming from the sides of the shade, but I haven't noticed that. Also, I bought a lighter shade of curtain, so maybe that's part of the problem. I would suggest others go with darker colors to block out the light.\n"", '\n  These are the real deal.  The room faces afternoon sun and gets HOT!  You can‚Äôt tell day from night with these.  It is still warm in the room but I can absolutely fee a difference.

It does block most of the sunlight and let‚Äôs say it does enough for a decent sleep in early morning hours. The material is good for the price and doesn‚Äôt feel cheap or anything that will deteriorate soon.\n', '\n  I like the depth these add to my room. They help it feel more lived-in and spacious, which is surprising because I actually moved things around so there is a bit less walk-space to make room for them. With the shutter blinds I already had in place they keep out most of the daylight, though if the shutters are open and these are closed I see more light than I want. My room did feel a bit more insulated against the cold last night (first night having them up), though not being able to use a space heater means I still have to layer my blankets wisely. They also feel smoother than I anticipated, which makes them more pleasurable to open and close. I am glad I got them. Definitely worth the price.\n']"

I liked the color and material, but they just weren't what I was looking for. I've checked out these curtains again recently, and it seems they've renamed them to clarify that they are 50% blackout curtains, which still seems a little misleading. Maybe they could call them gray out curtains, or just....curtains.  Anyways, after a couple nights of terrible sleep, I returned them ordered these 100% blackout curtains, and they are incredible!The curtains are thick and remind me of heavy hotel curtains. Even in broad daylight, they Ôøºmake my bedroom completely pitch black. The material is also really nice.My only complaint is that they're kind of a pain to de-wrinkle. I put them in the dryer with a damp cloth for twenty minutes, and I also ironed them before hanging them. However, I think it was time well-spent, as they now look pretty elegant.Overall, these curtains look good and will help improve your sleep, so if you're considering getting blackout curtains, you can't go wrong with these.Update, several months later: My neighbor texted me this morning asking what happened at our other neighbor's house last night. I replied that I went to be early and didn't know what he was talking about. It turns out that she had a gas leak, and a firetruck was parked in front of my house for 30 minutes, flashing its lights. I'm an incredibly light sleeper, and two of my 3 bedroom windows face the street, so the fact that I slept through the night makes me even more convinced that these curtains are the real deal!GET THEM!!!\n"", ""\n  Before I purchased, I read through so many of the reviews on these curtains. I had previously purchased similar curtains from Bed, Bath & Beyond and was sorely disappointed when they didn't work, so I was a bit skeptical that these would be any different. But,  I figured hundreds of 5 star reviews couldn't be wrong ‚Äî and they weren't. These do exactly as they say ‚Äî block the light completely, and help to muffle sound. I live next to a busy highway and as soon as I put these up, it sounded like the highway was far in the distance. I track my sleep every night, and since I've had these curtains I've gone from a 60%-70% quality of sleep to 90%+ every single night. Highly recommend!\n"", '\n  I bought ‚Äúblackout‚Äù curtains from Home Goods for my entire house except 3 windows. They didn‚Äôt have enough at the store so I purchased my last 3 from amazon. I paid $22/piece for the first ones which I‚Äôd rate as cheap now that I have my new NiceTown blackout curtains. The NiceTown curtains were double the price far superior in quality and blackoutness. Is that a word? Hahahaha. I loved my White NiceTown curtains so much I purchased them for all the rooms in my house. Do not double guess the price. They are totally worth it. Was kinda scared to put white curtains against an off white wall but they are super crisp and look great. Most of all, they are effective. My last 3 summer electric bills were $300-$330 respectively. My electric bill was $228 this month. Granted I had no window coverage before and is the reason I bought blackout curtains in the first place. I never write reviews. Ever. You needed to know this about these curtains. That‚Äôs how great I feel about them. Crisp, well made and effective!!!! Period.\n', ""\n  1- Yes, you can get blackout curtains, there- but, Amazon will get them to you in 3 or 4 days. Mine arrived in 2 days. I didn't even have to leave the house!2- IMO, the ones I saw at Walmart/Target weren't as thick. They had a black-liner- but that's about it.3- Because they weren't as thick (to me), they didn't feel like they'd do a whole lot.----These curtains were well worth the purchase. They're nice, heavy & made of great material- very durable. Folded, 1 panel felt like the weight of 2 or 3 pairs of jeans.2018 has been the hottest summer in Southern California- that I can remember, ever. I wanted these curtains to help keep the heat out of my direct, afternoon-sunlit-room. I didn't care about darkness. I was damn-near ready to find a way to mount my auto-shade onto the window sill. Not only did these curtains block out the sun & heat- they kept the room at a more-than-tolerable, temperature.-When I buy another set- no question about it- I'll come back & buy these.**Note- If you want your room dark- stretch the curtains out, to where the top (by the bar) is flattened. Pin curtain to the walls using thumbtacks. Folder the bottom of the curtain to sit on the window sill. This should lessen the amount of light (therefor, Heat) from creeping into the room.\n"", ""\n  I absolutely love the curtains. I was a little skeptical if they really keep the room dark. They let in a little bit of light where the slider is, and a little at the top of the window.

Beautiful and good quality. Completely blocks the sun in my spare bedroom which has direct sunlight. Great price as well!\n', '\n  You can‚Äôt put a value on a good night‚Äôs sleep. I used to be tired at work all the time. Then I got these. Now my bedroom is so dark I can‚Äôt tell the difference between my eyes being open or closed and I sleep like an absolute brick.I use Velcro strips to stick them to the walls and to each other - cuts down on all light getting through around the edges.\n', ""\n  I bought these because I get migraines and sometimes just need the darkest room possible. The curtains themselves are fantastic they block out light, however I will need to look at changing how I hang them because light does escape from above because the curtains are not flush with the wall due to my curtain rod. I find the curtains all hang quite nicely together (I have 4 panels) and I can set them up so there is no light that leaks through its one nice solid wall of no light. I think these are fantastic and would definitely recommend them to others.I have included 2 photos, you can see where the light gets in from the top because of my curtain rod I have at the moment, but that also gives you a good idea of how much light these curtains are blocking out because under that is just darkness. First photo is without flash and the second photo is with a camera flash.(the photos were taken just after I unpackaged them and hung them, the wrinkles you see worked themselves out over time and now hang nicely)I don't know if it helps with noise cancellation or energy savings or any of that, but it works perfectly for what I needed it for, which is room darkening.\n"", ""\n  Love these curtains!  Great material, nice and soft.  Specially love that they are pure white.  Hard to find a curtain without the greyish tinge.  Had been concerned that the black on the back would show.  Doesn't show at all.  Photos show the curtains right after they were taken out of the packaging and hung up.  Therefore, the wrinkles.  Hoping that with time the wrinkles will come out.  Have not washed them yet.  Highly recommend!\n"", '\n  Gorgeous colour, high quality material and a great fit. They are heavy enough to do their job but still not too heavy that I would need a heavy duty curtain rod. We bought them for the kitchen where we have glass doors leading onto the deck. Not for blocking out light but the cold draft in winter. And so far we are very happy. The kitchen is now a lot warmer when I come down in the morning and I can definitely feel a difference to before.There was no smell what so ever when we unpacked them. Very satisfied and considering buying more for other drafty windows in the house!\n']"

They are a nice cream color, just enough to soften the light.  Quality is good.  They hang nicely and are highly recommended by me.\n', '\n  I like keeping my curtains open to let light in, and this is a nice sheer addition to my curtains.  Having the extra layer of a sheet curtain, helps to keep people from seeing clearly through the windows into my house.  The cost was great as compared to similar products and as always, the prime shipping can\'t be beat!Pros: It\'s a nice sheer curtain. Light weight so it doesn\'t weigh down my double curtain rod hardware. Very thin. I like the thick hem at the bottom. Let\'s a lot of light in. Grommet hardware is also somewhat lightweight. Nicely stitched.Cons: The only con that I can honestly think of is that if you look closely, you can tell they were relatively inexpensive. The material at the top is mesh/cotton-like so that it\'s thick enough to hold the metal grommet hardware but it does have a ""cheap"" look to it if you are actually looking at it.  That said, not many people stare at your inner curtain that much so it\'s really not a huge deal to me but I thought I\'d make note of it.Did you find this review helpful? Let me know!\n', '\n  Love love love these sheer curtains! Great quality and exactly what I was looking for in my craft room. I previously ordered blackout ones but they were just too heavy for a place I create. I purchased 2 sets and it looks great. I was hoping to maybe get pink ones to put one panel on each end, just to give it some flair. I love these sheers and they\'re the perfect length (54"") so my desk doesn\'t go against them. They sit right above the top of my Ikea desk. They are perfect for my crafting room!\n', ""\n  Not bad. Honestly, I was expecting a cheap material but these are actually really nice. I wanted to brighten our living room so it doesn't look so dark and these sure met that expectation. I'm a stickler for natural lighting and love the way this changes the space. We have 3 big windows so 2 curtains in this pk allowed me to showcase two of them. Might order 1 more for the middle window. Maybe. I have black blackout curtains and compared this material next to those high-end ones. Very happy with these at the low cost as well. If you have curtains like I did already it helps to measure them so the size matches as well.\n"", ""\n  I shop everywhere, then I go to Amazon before buying practically anything. Purchased this 2-pack grommet sheer curtains in Ivory and was amazed at the quality for the price. They have a luxurious satin feel to them and the color was right on. This is an unbelievable find, and I'm very pleased with the awesome customer service from Amazon.\n"", '\n  I am extremely pleased with these curtains.  Sheer but not so thin you can see right through.  Gather nicely.  Fall straight.  Grommets are obvious but somehow rather stylish.  When hung on coordinating metal rod, the grommets actually look good.  Well made.  Get 1.5 window width for very sheer look.  Get 2-2.5 window width for more privacy.  I like them and have ordered more.  Ivory is a very very pale ivory.  Ivory is of the creamy pale shade, not tannish or yellowish.  Almost white but a soft white.  I have pure white, ivory, dark ivory, gray, pale green, and dark brown colors and this ivory blends well.  Very compatible with anything white or ivory either one, and of course other colors.  Recommend.\n', '\n  Beautiful curtains. I love them in our dining room. They are super sheer, so provide very little privacy but allow a lot of light in. I was very pleased with quality, length, and price.\n', '\n  Really nice, gives me privacy but yet I can see outside.  The grommets are a shiny silver, not the brushed look.  They came nicely and evenly folded, each 2 panel set wrapped nicely in see through plastic to protect them.  This was a good buy.  I shopped around and these did the trick. Arrived quickly, nicely packaged.\n', '\n  I Love these Curtains. The most amazing thing about them: they reflect the color of the walls (I am talking about white curtains). So, if your walls are violet, these curtains will have light violet tone. Price / Quality: exceeded my expectations. Thank you!\n', ""\n  The curtains are ok, I would say on an expensive side for the quality they are. Not sure why others say they look luxurious, to me they look like something very basic both in the look and quality of fabric (a little stiff to the touch too). One note is that if you have a cat, these curtains are easy to damage. I don't expect them to last more than a year. I liked my IKEA curtains more, but if these were priced around $20 it would make more sense.\n"", '\n  Thank You so very much, NICETOWN, for my awesome grommet curtains. I now have very inviting garden doors that provide privacy at night and a spectacular view during the day. I was so impressed with this company that I ordered three more pairs for my living room. My living room windows now look so fresh and updated. They totally match my garden doors!!! I am one very pleased shopper!!! The quality, the service, packaging, and delivery time were exceptional!!!\n', '\n  Love these curtains.  Great value for the spend, nominal for what I was looking for. 2 panels each, for 3 windows. Light in our livingroom  tends to be dark during the day. See pic. Late afternoon.  Keeps the light in, and enough coverage at night to not see right through. Bought extra panels  Bought magnetic ties, rod, also Amazon. Can configure curtains in different ways if desired.  1 curtain to cover half of this large set of windows, during the day. Push other set to the side panel.  Light flows through but view in, obstructed.  At night, double down. No biggie.  Super pleased.\n', ""\n  I ordered the offwhite since I have the offwhite solids on either side. I wanted to add sheets in the middle.  They are polyester but give an expensive look. Neat stitching. I steamed them.before hanging. I'm happy with it.\n""]"

They like to run up and down the sidewalk for no discernible reason yelling at the top of their lungs while their parents watch on in mild amusement drinking wine on their patio. Lovely family time, I guess. So, naturally, I put these on every window I could. And now my evenings are much quiter, without sacrificing the look of my apartment. They‚Äôre easy to pull back during the day when the goblins are away and easy to cover when they emerge in the evenings. So I can just cover my windows and put on a movie and it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre not even there! These block out a lot of light and sound from the neighborhood and match my decor nicely. I put sheer white curtains over these to create a softer look in the bedroom and it‚Äôs gorgeous! Saves my sanity and creates a nice atmosphere.\n', '\n  Not 100% blackout, but practically blackout. They\'re way better than the other ""blackout"" curtains I purchased from Target. Based on some other reviews, I was hesitant to try these. I\'m recovering from Post Concussion Syndrome, and light makes my head hurt. I bought these for one room in my house as a test. They blackout enough light that I purchased more for every room of my house except the kitchen and bathroom. The picture is how the room looks in broad daylight (11:45 AM, bright cloudless day, August in California). I think if I was a night shift worker, needing to sleep during daylight, I would probably supplement these curtains with these liners https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B003CHNBV8/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1 which I put in my bedroom, and they block all light (except the top, which you could probably block with a towel or blanket or something).\n', '\n  I‚Äôm a little bit disappointed in this order. The color and the curtains is adorable and the material I like it. But it definitely is not black out curtains at all. I have them up and my babies room and the camera doesn‚Äôt even shift tonight mode when I have them up. Here‚Äôs a picture of them and that‚Äôs with the blinds closed as well behind the curtains. If you‚Äôre looking for a black out I do not recommend buying these curtains.\n', '\n  We needed blackout machine-washable curtains for our west facing sun room. But replacing all of them would be very costly so I first got a cheap pair of Eclipse that was on sale. They blocked the sun okay but the texture was horrible.  It was like those sticky-plastic-y-old-and-dirty-motel-bulky curtains.So I searched a bit more and found those.  They are awesome!  Sure, they don\'t look expensive nor fancy at all, but definitely not like that horrible sticky vinyl texture. These are thick, soft and light.  For those who want to spend less, these are for ya!We wanted to block the sun but I hate having dark color curtains.  The beige worked out perfectly.  It\'s not 100% blackout but does a good job of blocking about 85% sun and heat, so I bought again for the entire house. I also got white and grayish white.The white did not block the sun much (maybe 50%, see picture). I was a bit worried how dark the grayish white would look.  I was happy to see that it was very light gray.  It ""almost"" looks like white in a shadow.  It does a better blocking than white, although not as effective as beige.I also like the grommet design.  It\'s so easy to open and close the curtains.I definitely buy again and recommend those!\n', '\n  Keeps the heat down in Phoenix. Every outside wall to our Lab is floor to ceiling glass. We live & work on the top af one of the taller buildings downtown. I put these up in the studio behind computer racks, between the blinds and glass. They knocked down temperatures in the lab by 5-6 degrees immediately. üëç\n', '\n  The picture is dark which goes to show you the curtains work. The color is as pictured in the photo. These are certainly blackout and solid curtains.\n', '\n  Very nice curtains and really thick too. Does not allow light to pass through (see pics attached). Overall, its worth the money you pay and I highly recommend this product.\n', '\n  We have east-facing windows and the sun heats up our house in the afternoon/evening. These have been excellent for keeping our dining room dark and cool!\n', '\n  I needed one pair of 42""x63"" curtains to complete a project I started using curtains I had already purchased from a national department store - - and the curtains being offered by Nicetown appeared to meet my needs.  Unfortunately, the colour I wanted wasn\'t available in the size I needed - so  Nicetown, without me asking them to do so, put me on a notification list - and as soon as they were available, they sent me an email.The curtains arrived 2 days later and, much to my surprise, the quality of the curtains, and the ability to block the light coming into a room, was far superior to the curtains I had already purchased, at a higher price, from the national department store (see photo below).I highly recommend Nicetown as a caring supplier, and their products for window covering needs.\n', ""\n  This should probably only be a four-star review as I ordered gray, but received green. However, the green look so much nicer than the gray would have that I'll go for the full 5-stars. I found that while I measured 77 inches for my window and ordered 84 inches of drapes, the folds meant these were far too small to cover the window they were intended for. They were perfect for another so that's where they are and they do look great. I guess the correct measurement for width should be something like real width plus 20 inches (at least.) The 77-inch windows now look great as well after I ordered 102-inch drapes.\n"", ""\n  These are super ! You can't find ones for a better value and they are really thick. I got a set for my sons room in the purple and some for our bedroom in red. The color is vibrant and lush and they do a fantastic job of blocking the sun. You may need another set of blinds behind if you want 100% black out but they work for us and you can't beat the price!\n"", '\n  I used this product to intend to limit noise and light in my bedroom. Noise isolation is not optimal, the curtains are not very efficient for this. No wonder, since they are even thinner than my original curtains. Light isolation is ok, not perfect.\n', '\n  Brilliant keeps out most light and they look great\n']"
