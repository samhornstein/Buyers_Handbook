Seriously, so small. Echo was easy to set up and worked perfectly the first time. Lots of cool voice features. No complaints there.But the microwave itself is terrible. We popped two bags of popcorn in a row one night and the microwave completely overheated, the little panel on the side lit on fire and has started to melt. It was only running for ~6 minutes total. I’m not sure if our model was defective or what, but having it less than a week and already broken is very disappointing.**update**Amazon has been calling and emailing me nonstop since I wrote this, even after I told them My boyfriend already returned it. They offered a free replacement or refund, which was nice of them, but I’m guessing they also wanted me to remove my review. Because I’m still getting calls. Even though amazon tried to fix the situation for me... this microwave was just bad.\n', '\n  Although the Alexa integration seemed a little gimmicky at first, I quickly changed my mind after realizing how simple it was to use. Traditional microwaves have a million features, but honestly, do you even know how to use half of them? Gone are the days of pushing a button and looking at cryptic abbreviated text on the numerical LED screen, wondering what input it is expecting.The 0.7 cuft cooking volume is on the smaller side for microwaves, but its perfectly appropriate for a dinner plate or cup of coffee, and doesn\'t use a ton of counter space.And for those wary of Alexa turning the microwave on for 90 hours instead of playing music, I have found it has quite a few safeguards. First, it will only turn on for reasonable amounts of times (my attempt to microwave tea for 10 or 100 hours did not work). Second, it is aware of how long ago the door was opened. If it has been too long, it will let you know this and not start. This will prevent the microwave from turning on inadvertently with nothing in it.One of the novel features is the ability for the microwave to keep track of your popcorn supply and automatically reorders once you get low. The popcorn consists of large value packs, priced between twenty and thirty dollars. Not bad for 36 packs of popcorn....in case you happened to eat a lot of it.I was a little disappointed that when I asked the microwave for ""Tea. Earl Grey. Hot,"" she did not know how to do this. I am hoping this is just a minor oversight by their software engineers and will be patiently waiting for this update.\n', '\n  \xa0This is a good small microwave for someone in an apartment.\n', '\n  A microwave is the most used kitchen appliance, or next to the refrigerator. Virtually every home has one. It is not something we shop for yearly, to replace, unless what we have is broken. However, could a voice control microwave be the new norm?First, here are the positives for this microwave. The price is unbeatable for a name brand product, an official Amazon brand, so you can trust it at least.  Secondly, despite the very low price, if you don’t want to use the voice control, you can still use it as a regular microwave.Nevertheless, as for now 2018, microwaves cannot produce a food, a snack or beverages themselves. You have to manually put your food in the microwave. So, my thought was, if I can put a leftover in the microwave to heat it up, why can’t I just press the buttons instead of using a voice command to warm my food? However, upon setting it up, I like the voice command more than pressing a couple of buttons.There is a catch to this though, the voice command is not built in the microwave, it only works with An Amazon Alexa echo dot. Upon receiving the microwave, you will connect it with your echo dot and command your echo dot to use the microwave as needed. It will acknowledge by repeating the command you gave and then start the microwave.Surprisingly, the voice command is more fluid to use even than using the buttons import we all are so used to.The downside is the Amazon echo dot is no Star Trek Enterprise computer that is smarter than the user. So, there are times you have to rephrase a command for it to work. For an example, I said to my echo dot, “start microwave for two minutes,” It had no idea what I was saying, but when I said, “microwave, for two minutes” it understood. I suppose, to use the command, after you call on your echo dot, you must follow by saying “microwave” then the command, warm soup . . . or reheat hot chocolate for two minutes etc.So, is it worth it? The answer is yes and no. If you spend a lot of time in your kitchen, you already have a microwave, likely one that is built into your kitchen, under the cupboard etc. Most people won’t replace their large microwave for a small microwave like the Amazon microwave simply because it has voice control. However, if you are moving into a new small home or you are a student, you might consider getting it. Or your current microwave is small, and you need a replacement without breaking the bank, you might consider it as well.The sound of the microwave isn’t loud, which is nice. Like most microwaves, there is a build in light when the microwave door is open and there is a digital clock on the microwave.\n', ""\n  This microwave is not powerful and heats food evenly.  Very low quality product.  It is cool that it is voice activated with Alexa, but you need a product that actually works, you can't just add voice to a crappy product.\n""]"

I already had a nice countertop convection oven so figured this would give me the ability to do 2 things at once. So after using it since last Friday here are my feelings broken down by function.1. Microwave: It is a bog standard microwave with 10 power setting and decent control. Have cooked one product in it, peas that steam in their bag, and the results were fine.2. Convection over: Have done, again, one thing in it. nice preheat feature which brings it up to the requested setting then waits for you to put in the food and tell it how long to cook. Now, for me, the downside, my set point for the item was 350 degrees and over the 15 minutes of cooking I watched the indicated temperature vary from 146 to 152. Now really a good hold for a temperature. Good feature was the food rotated while cooking so it was an even product. Am trying a different item tonight and will update.  11/18/19 update: This evening I roasted some potatoes at 400 degrees for 40 minutes and the results were fine, but I noted that the indicated temperature varied from 382 to 404 degrees during the cooking time. This is a 22 degree fluctuation and feel this is not acceptable regardless of whether it is due to a faulty indicator or bad thermometer.Air fryer: This is the main reason that I only give it 3 stars at present. There is no, as far as I can see, preheat for this feature and, further, it only has one heat option, 425 degrees. This creates a problem since many air fryer receipts call for temperature setting other then 425. Now, for preheat, you can fool it by calling for convection and getting it up to temperature that way. Since there is only the 425, you will have to play around with time to cook things properly. Yes there are presets, but most of what I would do are not in these presets.4. Alexa control: So far this seems to work fine. The Alexa button on the front is a good feature so you can bypass having to say 'Alexa'.As I get into using the oven, I will update this review.UPDATE 11/20/19: As I continue to explore how this oven functions, I believe that I have figured out why I am getting such wide fluctuations in temperature in the oven box. Because it is also a microwave, the workings of the oven including the heating elements are located in a separate area that is shielded. It is the circulation fan that brings the hot air into the main box but I am thinking that the temperature probe is located in the air stream so when the heating elements go off the cooler air blows over it and drops the indicated temperature and conversely when the elements cut on, the warmer air raises the indicated temperature. I am going to put an old fashion oven thermometer into the box and watch it over the course of a cook. Will report my findings.

It is important (when  you're done) to never leave the microwave without clearing the timer . If by mistake you push in the dial the microwave will continue cooking. And you can start a fire .

It's like muscle memory when using dials - love that!  Nice looking- a little bigger than I wanted, but it's a GREAT deal. Revolving glass plate works nicely. I never bother with instructions and clocks, b/c I basically just reheat.  It's plastic on the fascia, but easy to wipe down.\n""]"

You should ask yourself - do I need a microwave large enough to defrost a frozen ostrich? Do I need 2500 watts of power so that there's a 3 second margin of error between warming up my Dinty Moore and painting the walls of my microwave with it? When you reach a certain age, you start rethinking some things. I bought a luxury microwave and all I use it for is to reheat junk food that wasn't that good the first time around. Yeah, Dennis, I do need to exercise more. But I'm also going to buy a smaller microwave and clear up some counter space for more fruit. This is that microwave, and I recommend it.\n"", '\n  We moved into a new house with no range microwave so I was on the hunt for a countertop. This one fit the bill and after a month of use, we are pretty happy with it. I was looking for:- Quick 30 button that didn’t need an addition button press to start- Quick minute button, bonus for 2-6 quick minute buttons- Handle to open the door- >=1000w power- Bonus points for small footprint due to limited counter spaceThe only thing that really missed the mark was the footprint, but I did a lot of comparisons, and this one’s footprint is pretty much average for a microwave of this capacity.We didn’t need a fancy machine with all the bells and whistles. We really just needed something that would reheat leftovers so we don’t use the presets or other functions on this microwave. I did try the butter melt/soften function once and the butter boiled over, so I don’t think they really work all that well anyway.Overall, we are very happy with this microwave! A countertop microwave with a handle instead of a button for door operation really narrows down the choices, and I’m really happy we chose this one!\n', '\n  This model has very easy to use and convenient control features.  90% of the time, we push one button to start the microwave.  we really like that the finish does not show fingerprints like our previous stainless steel microwave did. The unit is powerful enough to be reasonably fast, yet space saving size and tall enough inside for anything we want to use it for.  The only negative so far is the custom defrost cycles are way too aggressive, actually starting cooking both beef and chicken about 1/2 way through the recommended time - not good.  If I enter about 50% of the actual weight of the item, the recommended time is about right. Very good value at $110.\n', '\n  Simple and effective.  I love the door handle as apposed to the press button other brands have to open the door - it works a lot better.\n', '\n  The size is great. Noise is a lot less than my last one. The controls are really convenient for quick cooking.  A button for melting or softening button to 1 lbs. button for defrosting.  The front is anti smudge.  It came quick. I did buy on sale, but it was worth the money.  It is quiet, convenient buttons, hardly any cleaning, and looks great. I would buy again.\n', ""\n  Great microwave as it should be for this price lol. No problems at all. It's powerful and spacious.i can put a full size bag of microwavable popcorn in there and it will not touch the sides while spinning on the plate.\n"", '\n  Update: After nearly two years of use this microwave oven is going strong and I am still super satisfied with it. Highly recommended.*******************************************************************************************************************************************************So far so good! The kitchen is going to be renovated late this summer, and our old GE microwave which came with the house needed to be replaced to match. (The GE was working well and adequate, but was a bit of a fashion faux pas in any environment.)After reading lots of reviews for mid-sized microwaves, I decided to try this Toshiba.  The kitchen will feature a black sink and black commercial faucet, with light gray countertop with dark veins/patterns, the floor will be dark grey tile.  So the colour and exterior styling of this Toshiba fits right in.More important are a couple of things I’ve noticed in the short period I’ve had this unit.First, it is quiet! At least it is much quieter than the old GE.  Second, the various settings seem to work well.  I used the sensor reheat yesterday evening for the first time and it worked very well.  I have yet to try any of the other auto settings; I’ve never used many such settings in the past.  But this little guy has me intrigued for some strange reason.One or more reviews stated they could not get the beeper turned off even when following the instructions.  It DOES work; just press the #8 on the keypad long enough.  The trick is to hold the key press long enough.  The manual states 3 seconds, but I think it is more like 4 seconds. This setting will change back to default if the power goes out and the unit resets, but that’s to be expected.All-in-all I’m very happy so far.  As I get more practice with it I will try to remember to update this review.  I’ve always been happy with most Toshiba products, including a 39” LED television that I purchased from Amazon a few years ago.\n', ""\n  GREAT microwave for an apartment..Not too big,but good on strength/heating.. & it's Easy to use!!\n"", ""\n  The turntable in my 15 year old Sharp, stopped working and the outside of the microwave was getting really hot. I decided that it was time for a change. After a lot of product comparisons, I chose this Toshiba.The size is exactly what I wanted. The oven looks good and is very stable on my counter top. I have no issues with the handle, even though my Sharp just had a button to push, to open the door. It also doesn't weigh that much.My major issue are the functions. There is a lot you can do with this microwave. But although it is the same wattage as my old oven, it just doesn't heat as well. Something that took 10 minutes in the old one, takes about 13-15 in this one. The automatic popcorn setting is ridiculous. Cooking time is about 1 min and 15 seconds. I had to put the popcorn back in for another minute. It really didn't come out very edible. I am not technologically challenged at all, but I just don't find this oven intuitive. It's a bit too complicated and lacks basic heating logic! I never know what the actual power level is, there are too many steps for a lot of the functions and in general, you have to actually memorize most of the functions - or constantly refer to the manual. I find one of the easier functions is the sensor reheat. So far most of the items have heated up very well, although you should keep an eye on the food and check it. I nearly had a bowl of soup boil over.My favorite feature is actually the timer. It's easy to use, especially compared to my old oven. Setting the clock isn't an issue either.Please note that I am doing a practical comparison of this oven, to 3 other ovens which I use regularly. They are older and all are much more user-friendly.A positive note; for anyone who has eyesight issues, you can easily operate the function buttons without using reading glasses, especially once you are used to the placement of the buttons. Also, the manual is well written and easy to understand.Overall, I would probably recommend this oven. I am pretty sure that I will get used, after I've had it longer (I have only had it for about a week). I just hope that this oven lasts as long as the others I have owned.\n"", ""\n  Don't often write reviews for general goods but this one deserves it.Microwave interfaces are usually terrible. The Toshiba is amazing. buttons 1-6 give 1-6minutes respectively with a single touch! Which is 98% of what you need. Need an extra 30s then the start button will add that for you.The Pièce De Résistance has to be the fact you can turn all the beeps off. So making that late night snack doesn't wake the house up or need you to open the door 1s before the end. Magical! Though I have forgotten about what I was microwaving a couple of times because it is fairly quiet and in a busy kitchen you can't hear it.The final awesome point is you can turn off the clock display so to save that mW of energy. I do wish though that it would do 24hr time but it is a minor quibble.There are loads of other buttons but frankly all I press is the 1,2,3 and Start buttons.\n"", ""\n  We searched endlessly for a new microwave for our new home and happened to come across a Wirecutter article (do a web search for it) where they took some of the most popular microwaves and put them through a ton of tests. The Toshiba models were at the top of the list for even cooking (use potatoes for testing), best popcorn performance with the least amount of kernels left at the end, good defrost performance, intuitive easy to use controls and their one year warranty you supposedly don't send the unit back, rather you provide them with a receipt and they issue you a refund cheque which is much appreciated. So far we love the unit as it's easy for our kids to use as it has that basic 1980's style control layout not one of these new ones that tries to be some science fiction 2120 food preparation units. Popcorn bags come out perfect and reheating food is nice and even. First Toshiba microwave I've ever owned and I don't know I'll ever go back to Panasonic after this.\n"", '\n  Tras hacer pruebas y hablar a soporte técnico de Alexa, me dijeron que este horno no es compatible con Alexa en México, levanté mi queja en Amazon para que inclusive cambien la publicación cosa que a la fecha no han hecho, y siguen engañando a la gente diciendo que es compatible con Alexa en México, Lo que repito está totalmente verificado que en México no funciona según Amazon, deberían de cambiar la publicación!\n', '\n  I has bought another microwave oven a month before this one. That one boasted of being superior in ""inverter technology"" but turned out to be a pain and took forever to heat food. So I returned that one and bought this. This Toshiba microwave oven is so good. Very quiet and powerful. Food hests evenly. Easy to use and does exactly what each button states. It is built sturdy and I am sure it will last for many years. I think it is the best microwave oven I have ever owned.\n']"

Funny, I even read a review on the Black & Decker website stating that it was not the quoted 0.7 cubic feet but I did read that the glass turntable was 10"", which is what our old one was, so I took a chance. I didn\'t measure the inside as the walls aren\'t perfectly flat, but I can tell you that our 10 7/8 dinner plate would not fit into the interior unless we tilted it - which doesn\'t seem like a great idea w/ a plate full of food.
