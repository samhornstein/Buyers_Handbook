Which is a good thing!This is a great little laptop! for $200 this is a steal. 64 gigabytes is enough for windows 10. If you get a 128GB mini SD card, then this laptop will work great for you. Now if you plan on using this to store pictures, videos and other files, for awhile, then you will run out of space (with the laptop alone). But with a mini SD card or a flash drives to store your files, you\'ll be fine.If you are a heavy computer user and need it for heavy video editing, photoshop or a heavy gamer, then obviously this won\'t work for you. I use windows movie maker. It works just fine. This can play light games or games that have been released from the early 2000\'s (if you play on Steam).. Newer games that need Gforce and what not.. Obviously not. This laptop is for the casual user, but can hold its grounds when using other programs.I have used adobe elements for video editing.. Does it work. yes, it does! is it the best computer to use it on.. haha, no. But it does work on this laptop, though this isn\'t the idea computer you\'d used a program on like this. But if you\'re on a tight budget and don\'t mind the laptop taking a few extra moments to process everything, then go for it.The keyboard and the mouse pad works like butter.

If your expectations are reasonable (i.e. don\'t expect to find a large screen, don\'t expect to run intense programs or games) then I think you will be happy with this.The notebook comes with Windows 10S (not windows 10) which can be upgraded free and easily.  If the upgrade is not made, then you are limited to the programs/apps in windows\' store which is not very comprehensive.  The only issue here is that the Windows 10 version the upgrade goes to is 64 bit (not 32) which has compatibility issues with some older programs.I found the eMMC disk drive to be fast, the computer boots in a few seconds.  There is a Micro SD slot.  256GB micro sd card is only around $25 and is immensely helpful in increasing available storage (buy a name brand only; i.e. microcenter, sandisk, pny, crucial, kingston, etc etc).  The internal eMMC drive or the RAM can not be upgraded.WiFi is strong, the screen is only 11.5"" but is very bright and has very good resolution and color.  The USB ports are V 3.x.  The keyboard does not feel cramped or compromised in any way despite the small size of the notebook.  Too bad it does not have a trackpoint which would be very helpful in navigating more precisely on the small screen.I have only had this so far for a week so I can not comment on durability.  The card slot seems a bit flimsy.I have been unable to get anything near the ""whole day"" claim on a battery charge.  6 hours is about it but obviously that is still very good.Overall I believe this is a very good choice especially for this price range; this laptop is not much heavier than a tablet but is much more useful.  Also, Windows 10 is far more versatile than the Chrome OS, in my opinion anyway.\n', ""\n  I bought this on Prime day to replace an android tablet. Wanted something a little more capable, yet portable. I installed several Linux distros without a hitch. Settled on Mint 19. It's rock stable and runs smooth as butter. I added a 200gb micro sd for data storage and have a 2 tb slim USB HD for more extensive things like video. I haven't found much that this mighty mouse will not do. If you need am inexpensive portable Linux machine, look no further.All you kind folks having winows problems on this laptop, save yourself a boat load of headaches and jump off the Microsoft bandwagon. Try linux.  Mint is a great place to start. It will easily handle your web, office and email. I have even edited photos with the (free) equivalent of Photoshop and Lightroom  ... GIMP and Darktable. I understand that there is a place for Windows et al on a more capable machine, but for something this light and portable I have not found a better way to go.\n"", '\n  I was sent an L203MA. From the first moment, the touchpad was weird.  It only was accurate when I started the curser when my finger was 1/2 inch from base of the track pad. Now that may have fixable software problem, but the downloaded driver files specific to this model would not work with it as recommended by ASUS as a possible fix.  Now that problem was nothing compared to my main complaint. The From the manufacturer description in Amazon said that this model came with a backlit keyboard. In the ASUS FAQ and later confirmed by the ASUS Chat representative, it did not. I am returning this unit today.  I have never given a one star rating and am doing this to make sure that others be aware of the inaccurate description provided in the item’s description.\n', ""\n  So far very happy!

I spent a great deal of time trying to find an affordable laptop that was actually a laptop and not a Chromebook as those do not run with windows10 and do not have the capabilities of a standard laptop depending on your needs after a very long time I decided on this and I am extremely happy so far that I did especially with the included windows 10 and office 360 I really don't know you can get a better deal than this just remember before buying the actual size of this laptop is very small so if you want something big this isn't your deal however its size makes it perfect for travel and lugging around!\n"", ""\n  Overall this is what I wanted/needed. I was primarily looking for something small and lightweight that I can use to edit papers (grad student/copy editor). It isn't super fast or fancy but it works well, carries easy, and looks nice.

C'est toutefois un excellent appareil pour la bureautique, navigation Internet et travaux scolaires des enfants.Je n'ai pas essayé Windows, j'ai immédiatement installé Linux à la place. Selon ma compréhension, le système d'origine est Windows 10 S, ne permettant d'installer que des applications signées par Microsoft, avec possibilité de passer à une licence Windows 10 Home gratuitement.Accès facile au BIOS avec F2 pour désactiver Secure Boot et démarrer sur clé USB. J'ai démarré sur un Live USB et fait une image intégrale (dd) sur une clé USB3 en environ 1 heure. J'ai essayé ElementaryOS et Xubuntu qui fonctionnaient parfaitement bien. Touches FN pour luminosité, volume, etc. fonctionnaient très bien.Tourne les vidéos YouTube 1080P sans problème grâce au GPU intégré au processeur. Diffusion sur Chromecast depuis le navigateur Chrome/Chromium. Qualité du son correcte, volume assez fort au maximum. Le trackpad n'est pas le meilleur mais fait le travail pour le prix et est aisément remplacé par une souris sans fils. Webcam SD (non HD), qualité très moyenne mais correcte pour une utilisation occasionnelle. Libreoffice et VLC tournent aussi parfaitement bien.Mise en garde: Installation de Linux relativement simple depuis un Live USB si vous en avez moindrement l'expérience. Toutefois soyez avisés que si vous n'avez pas les connaissances requises pour faire une copie intégrale du disque interne au préalable (ex: dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/cleusb/image.dd), l'opération est irréversible. Vous ne pourrez plus revenir à Windows par la suite et ce n'est pas couvert par la garantie du fabriquant.Si vous avez faite vos recherches et êtes conscients des limites de ce système avant de procéder à son achat, vous devriez en être pleinement satisfait.------------------------------The model I received is L203MA-DS04. 2-core CPU 2.6 GHz max with 8GB integrated GPU, 4GB RAM, 64GB eMMC storage, 2 USB3 ports + 1 USB-C.Keyboard is English only so keep that in mind if you needed French characters and don't know the proper key combinations by heart or you're buying for a French user.Take note that the specs are really minimalistic to run Windows 10 and most negative reviews about this laptop reflect that aspect.I didn't try Windows as I immediately installed Linux instead. From my understanding, the base system is Windows 10 S, which only allows to run software signed by Microsoft, although you are allowed to upgrade to Windows 10 Home for free.Easy access to the BIOS with F2 key to deactivate Secure Boot and boot from USB drive. I booted on a live USB and made a disc image (dd) on USB3 within about an hour. I tried ElementaryOS and Xubuntu, both ran exceptionally well. Function keys for brightness, volume, etc. were supported without any problems.I played YouTube videos on 1080P without any problem thanks to the CPU's integrated GPU. Using Chromecast from Chrome/Chromium was not a problem. Sound quality is ok and loud enough at max setting. Trackpad isn't the best of its kind but does the job for the price and is easily mitigated with a wireless mouse. Webcam is standard définition (non-HD) a quality was average but still ok for the occasional use. Libreoffice and VLC also ran without any issue.Please take note: installing Linux from a Live USB is relatively easy if you have experienced it before. However, if you don't have the knowledge to make a disc image of the entire drive beforehand (hint: dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/cleusb/image.dd), removing Windows will be irreversible. You won't be able to get it back and that's not the kind of situation that would be covered by the manufacturer's warranty.If you have done your research properly and are aware of its limitations before buying, you should be plenty satisfied.\n"", ""\n  Extremely light and portable, fits great on airplane trays, fast enough to run chrome with multiple extension (4gb model). The keyboard is nice and does not flex like the other Asus 11.6 from the previous years. Love that it's using a micro SD and not a full size SD that stick out like every other laptop this size. Very lous speakers but no bass at all.The only downside is the screen viewing angle is quite bad and the battery is only good for 5 hours. Would love to see the same laptop with IPS display and 12 hours battery for 100$ more. USB C charging wouls also be great.\n""]"

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n"", ""\n  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n"", '\n  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as ""basic needs"" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today\'s needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don\'t expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I\'ve already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to ""S Mode"" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I\'ve disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n', '\n  La computadora me llego antes de la fecha estipulada y el equipo bien protegido, sin detalles funcionando perfectamente, también respecto a las especificaciones es un excelente pc para trabajos de ofimática que puede corren incluso algunos juegos gracias el buen procesador razer 7. No es un equipo de gaming pero puedo decir que puede dar un poco mas para lo que realmente se le requiere, estéticamente en una pc muy bonita y estoy satisfecho con la compra, tengo aparte una muy buena laptop gamer pero realmente me gusta mas esta laptop por su facilidad de portar, mientras que el otro equipo es mas pesado, tiende a calentar mas y su batería dura muy poco por la misma razón. En conclusion es una laptop muy bonita, practica y que puede dar un poco mas al poder correr juegos que repito no es un euipo gamer pero puede correr juegos. Por parte del vendedor, muy rapido y el producto a muy buen precio, totalmente recomendado.\n', '\n  Llego papel bond y no la computadora. en breve subo el video\n', '\n  Seré muy general, y hablaré sobre los puntos que me interesan y que creo que pueden ser de más utilidad.Llevo un mes con la laptop, la cual se desempeña bastante bien, si pensamos en el procesador, es muy bueno, a pesar de que es un Ryzen 7 3700u y que en el mercado ya está el 4000, no por eso deja de ser una computadora que te da estabilidad en su uso, una de las desventajas que tiene es que trae por defecto Norton Antivirus, pero se lo puedes quitar y no hay mayor problema, por otro lado la construcción del equipo es bastante buena, es sólida, es de aluminio que en lo particular me parece de muy buen gusto, sólo el marco de la pantalla es plástico.El micrófono es bueno, no tienen que gritar para que te escuchen.Cosas que tengo que me gustan: La calidad del vídeo, la velocidad de la computadora, al prenderla, sólo tarda en cargar unos segundos, para hacer trabajos de renderizado los hace muy rápido, y no se traba.El teclado a pesar de que no es en español es muy cómodo, y tiene el teclado alfanumérico, para solucionar esa parte del teclado en español pueden activar el teclado virtual, y verificar la posición de las teclas, sólo es cuestión de acostumbrarse. El teclado se siente ligero y sobre todo es cómodo. Me gusta que sea retroalimentado. Otra cosa que me gusta es el peso, es sumamente ligera. Y en la parte de abajo tiene tres gomas grandes, que ayudan a que se sujete.La computadora no se calienta si se mantiene en una altura considerable, pueden pasar días, y estar prendida y no le causa ningún problema de temperatura. La pila tiene una duración de hasta 6 horas aproximadamente.Cosas que no me gustan:La posición del ventilador está bajo la laptop, no a un lado, sino se mantiene libre se llega a calentar,El sonido es bastante bajo, pero es claro, no es abrumador, a mi no me molesta ya que utilizo audífonos la mayor parte del tiempo.La cámara no se ve clara del todo, pero si es funcional.Opinión general.Esta computadora Aspire 5, es una computadora que tiene calidad, y que estable, el teclado es muy cómodo y tiene buena velocidad que se las proporcionan tres elementos, el procesador, la memoria y el disco de estado sólido, todo eso hace que esta computadora sea funcional y sobre todo que tenga poder de procesamiento. Ciertamente si la buscan para juegos si tiene la capacidad de reproducirlos y mantenerse con buen desempeño. Le he dejado haciendo múltiples procesos y no se traba, ha permanecido prendida hasta por dos o tres días. Si buscas una computadora que tenga poder y, sobre todo, sea bonita y ligera, esta es la opción. Pero si quieren fuerza bruta, compren una gamer, por el precio de esta laptop, creo que no podrían conseguir un mejor equipo.Sugerencias:Si necesitan una cámara de mejor calidad o un teclado en español, se lo pueden comprar, la computadora vale la pena y se va a poder desempeñar de manera adecuada.Compren un soporte o un ventilador, con eso solucionan el calor en el ventilador.En vista de que no tiene muchas conexiones para usb, les recomiendo que compren un Hub, eso les evitará muchos dolores de cabeza.Si la ven a bajo precio no duden en comprarla. Es una computadora estable.\n', '\n  Por qué mi laptop viene diferente a la de la imagen incluso distinta a las imágenes de clientes las entradas y el soporte entre pantalla y teclado\n', '\n  Es un excelente equipo, sin embargo en mi caso, por ser el teclado en inglés y usar mucho los símbolos por razones laborales, no me acomodó y tuve que devolverla. Me dio trabajo conseguir una tan buena en relación calidad-precio, aunque al final pude conseguirla directo en una tienda. Con Amazon la devolución procedió completa y exitosamente (guardé la caja, empaques, todo afortunadamente). Si no tienes problema por el teclado en inglés, la recomiendo ampliamente.\n']"

Many people writing reviews on Amazon about their frustrations with certain Chromebooks are almost entirely confused about-- or unfamiliar with-- the OS, so they take it out on the machine. That\'s not fair or accurate.By way of background, I also need to explain that I bought a pair of ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Chromebook flips with touchscreens back in 2015. They have very glossy/shiny screens which glare, but the touch screen feature is nice. They also feature an actual aluminum metal chassis which is very elegant and classy looking (although prone to scratches).I saw this ""ruggedized"" version of a Chromebook on Amazon and thought I\'d pick one up. I\'m already an Asus fan, I like the Chromebook OS, and I was looking for a more durable Chromebook to literally throw in my backpack or briefcase and head out the door-- without worrying about a sleeve, case, or possible scratches if none of these was used.Well, this ""ruggedized"" version looks like it\'d be great for children. Not so great for professional adults who\'ve been spoiled with the nicer Chromebooks or laptops. I don\'t mean to be harsh because the chassis isn\'t awful, but it does have more of a look of Fisher Price or Leapfrog than Apple or PC.The Screen: The screen on this laptop is dimmer and more grainy (of that makes sense) than my other two laptops (both my other Chromebook and a PC laptop). The screen is anti-glare to be sure (a good thing), but you can sort of see a matrix pattern on the screen (a bad thing). The colors are also ever-so-slightly more washed out and dull. I compared all the screens side-by-side. If you\'re a student or a parent buying this for a child in grade-school, I don\'t think you\'ll be disappointed. If you\'re a photographer, visual artist, or someone who with a keen eye who enjoys HD movies, you\'ll notice that this screen is simply not up to par with other laptops on the market.The Keys: The keys on this laptop are my biggest frustration. While many keyboards today are back-lit, that would be a luxury on a Chromebook. Fair enough. But is it too much to ask for high-contrast silk screening? Maybe a phosphorescent or white print color for the keys? Apparently so. This keyboard has mid-to-dark-blue lettering on black keys. A really, really stupid choice that makes no scientific or practical sense other than to match the color blue to the ""ruggedized"" cover trim. These keys will be hard to see in low-lighting. Lastly, the keys on this keyboard are noticeably taller than on my other Asus Chromebook. Probably twice as tall. You feel like you\'re typing on a manual typewriter. Very poor design choice.Summary: If I were a parent, I\'d buy my kid this laptop in a heartbeat. It\'s compact, durable, water-resistant, has excellent battery life, access to the Internet, if used with Google Drive and Google Docs all work is saved and backed-up automatically, the laptop is somewhat immune to viruses, and it\'s certainly rugged. However, if I were a college student and wanted all the above *plus* the ability to really enjoy streaming movies and to comfortably type-up term papers for hours on end, I\'d probably get a Chromebook with a nicer screen and better keyboard. Sadly, for me, this laptop was a no-go and I\'ll be returning it. Sticking with the aluminum Asus 2-in-1 with touchscreen.If you found this review, please give me a thumbs up. Cheers.\n', '\n  This is a very solid feeling unit, unlike many inexpensive Chromebooks. All the reviews are spot on about performance and battery life. I take exception to the comments about this unit (or any Chromebook) being ""limited."" Google ""install Ubuntu on Chromebook"" and follow the instructions, and you will have a fully functional Linux computer. Install LibreOffice for your office suite, Gimp for photo editing, Audacity for audio recording and editing, and any other Linux applications you want. Put a 64 GB SD card in the slot for all your data. You will have a computer that is more secure than any Windows computer, costs a small fraction of any Mac computer, and can do pretty much anything you want. The world of Linux software is amazing, and it is all free, OK, so it can\'t manage your iPhone, but it can do darn near anything else. All for under $200. I do not see myself going back to Windows or Mac ever.\n', '\n  Great little device for writing.  I am a writer and I needed something simple without a lot of bells and whistles and whips and chains :)  This little Chromebook netbook is awesome for traveling.  It takes a little bit to get used to Chrome\'s operating system, but once you do you\'ll discover some very nice proprietary advantages.A small—but nice thing—is not having to right click any more; instead, you simply tap with two fingers for word corrections.  This is great for someone like me who writes a lot and needs to have a simplified workflow.The battery is long lasting and the keyboard is a perfect size, even for someone as big as I am. 6\'3"" 300.Because I use google docs to write with, this seemed a natural step. Chromebook seamlessly integrates Google Docs, and most other important apps into the framework of the little machine, so it\'s very easy to use and get started. The offline stuff is very useful too as I\'m not always in a place where there\'s wifi and I can still work on my books.Another nice feature is how light it is.  My wife bought a laptop a couple years ago and she would share it with me (begrudgingly) and I always hated working on it because it was big, heavy, and clunky.  This little Chromebook weighs next to nothing and is easy to tote around.All in all, I\'d give this 10 stars if I could—especially considering the price.Disclaimer - shameless self-promoting in the photo :)\n', '\n  49 year old 3D designer here. I was looking for a light weight solution to get me out of my office when I just needed to use the internet, google docs etc. Figured for $200 it would just be a nice little cheap toy. This thing is pretty amazing. Nice keyboard, decent screen, great webcam (to use mostly with Hangouts) good speakers  and its really fast. I watched about 4 hours of videos on battery and it only went down to 79% full. Solid unit, very happy with purchase.\n', '\n  This product is ridiculous. The wifi does not consistently connect, whether I am on campus where I’ve never had any issues connecting to wifi, or I am at home a meter away from my internet modem. The wifi signal will forever be “connecting”, show “no connection” or be stuck disabled. Right when you need to write a quick email or look up something, the wifi will not connect. The only solution I’ve found is to restart the computer 5-6 times and if I’m lucky, the wifi will connect for a minute or two before disappearing again.This computer will not work right when you need it most.I am fraught with regret buying this Chromebook and should have spend a few extra dollars getting a real computer.I would not recommend this Chromebook, or any Chromebook for that matter, given my horrible experience with this turd of a product.I am disappointed with this laptop like a father is disappointed with his failure of a son still living in the basement at 27. I cannot simply kick it to the curb and disown it lest I be negligent and wasteful, but yet I am ashamed and embarrassed to take it out in public.\n', ""\n  Excellent Chromebook. I have an ASUS Zenfone 4, and this connects seamlessly to its apps, as well as the Google apps directory. Given I pretty much live online in Google docs, sheets, etc, I don't need separate programs on my laptop, so this is a great, simple replacement for my aging MacBook Air. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a cloud-driven laptop.\n"", '\n  My daughter uses Chromebook at school so I looked for one for home use. We purchased this and started using in Jan so we have had approx 3 months use. Screen size of 11.6"" is just right for a young child and also make it easy to carry and not too heavy. The laptop opens 180% so no chance of breaking the hinges. Also like the ruggedized design so it handles bumps well and does not skid on smooth surfaces. Thankfully have not yet had to test the waterproof feature:-).  Enough power to do her school assignments and chat on Google hangouts with her school friends. Overall she is very happy which is what matters.\n', ""\n  Perfect for a high-school student. If you're gonna be somewhere with wifi when you work, I'd highly suggest a Chromebook. If you're looking for a chromebook, I highly suggest this one (I've used 2 others before on a daily basis and this is better)Update: I've had this Chromebook for four months now, absolutely no problems, plus Ive dropped it twice and no damage whatsoever. Very pleased with this product\n"", '\n  I love it! I am a person who has multiple Google accounts and so I love that I can have tabs open from different accounts without having to sign out of an account.
