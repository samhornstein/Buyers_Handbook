(Plus its beautiful!!!)Well I got it in and was so excited only to be completely let down because the pointer was ""jerky"" on the screen and it was hard to maneuver.... BUT I am absolutely ECSTATIC to report that after a month of using it I FINALLY realized this morning that there are PROTECTOR FILMS ON THE BOTTOM of the mouse!!!! After removing them I am so happy to say that after going through 6 mouses in 3 months I am finally COMPLETELY SATISFIED with this one!!! Moral of my story... DON\'T BE A IDIOT LIKE ME AND REMOVE THE FILM PROTECTORS :)\n', '\n  Being one of the only IT guys in the family and among my group of friends; I often get asked questions on what are good tech products, after all some of these items are usually expensive and no one likes wasting money. With the past holiday season, I helped pick out laptops for nieces and nephews for school, gaming laptops for the friends, a custom made pc, and a slick new Macbook Pro. With all these new systems being bought, everyone’s next question is “What accessories should I purchase??”, I always suggest that anyone buying a laptop at least get a wireless mouse.I have used wireless mice for years; there are great mice, good mice, and downright awful mice. Most of the choices out there on the market are going to be based on what you personally like, what feels good to you, and what functions well.  I do a fair amount of travel for work and I have certain criteria for equipment to make it into my travel bag; after all I will be carrying that equipment around the airport from anywhere between 6-12 hours, so no junk allowed!!For a wireless mouse I look for the following:• Use on any surface laser• Skids that slide well with ease on multiple surfaces• Long term battery life• Small USB receiver• Comfort and size• And above all else PRICEThe VicTsing MM057 checks off all of my criteria and more! On top of having all the features I require from above it also has:• six (6) buttons, two of which are custom programmable which means you can make them do whatever you’d like!!• On the Fly Adjustable DPI – this means you can adjust the sensitivity whenever you’d like, which is great if you like to play video games, this feature can come in handy.• 2.4GHz wireless with a 15-foot reach, so you can easily use this for a media center pc while sitting comfortably on the sofa.VicTsing got it right with the MM057, it is super comfortable in the hand, it’s large enough to provide good support to help prevent hand fatigue, and groves for your thumb and ring and pinky fingers (sorry lefties this is right handed only), it has a really soft rubber coating, smooth gliding action, and an ultra crisp scrolling wheel and button clicks. I tested the MM057 on PC and Mac, it was plug and play on both, which means you will be using your new mouse in seconds. I like to carry my laptop around with me throughout the day and the MM057 worked on every surface I put it on which allowed me to be truly mobile and move about how I wanted without having to carry around a mouse pad and worry about a flat surface, the MM057 will work on your jeans just fine if you are so inclined.Another major plus is using a single AA battery as the power source, not only are these more common to find around the office/home than AAA but in my experience the AA tend to last longer in mice and you only need one versus the two you would usually need for AAA. There is convenient storage for the Micro USB receiver on the bottom of the mouse, so if you choose to unplug the receiver there is a safe place to store it so it does not get lost. The adaptor is a great size, it is slim-line enough to leave plugged in all the time, even when you need to carry your laptop around in your bag or briefcase without fear of it breaking off.This is one of my favorite mice; I give it 5 out of 5 because it deserves it. It is a great mouse for a great price. I recommend them to friends and family, and VicTsing stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty. Buy with confidence, great product, great price, and fast shipping.\n', ""\n  I'm a gamer, and this was meant more for my girlfriend who does simple browsing and maybe typing some documents.For me, this would definitely not be enough, but I would obviously go for something more involved - like a mouse with 500 buttons and serves me Mountain Dew and orders pizza for me.But if you're like my absolutely terrifying girlfriend, and you do basic things on your pc or mac, this definitely works and it's cheap. No problems after over a year of ownership.Oh, if you have hands the size of Donald Trump's, you may enjoy it more. People of the large-handed sort are going to find it uncomfortable. It's pretty compact.\n"", ""\n  I've purchased no less than a dozen wireless mice over the years and nothing else comes close to this one.ERGONOMICS/COMFORT: I'm a man with medium sized hands and it is difficult to find a mouse that isn't too large or too small. Fortunately for me this mouse fits PERFECTLY in my hand, allowing me to easily rest my ring and pinky fingers on it. In terms of ergonomics it is one of the most comfortable mice I've ever used, be it wired or not.DESIGN/BUILD: The scroll wheel isn't loud and has a nice texture to it. It's also very responsive, which is hard to find in a lower budget mouse. The left side buttons are positioned in a good spot so that I don't have to make an effort to use either of them. There is a DPI button located in the top center of the mouse. Often these buttons can be hit on accident during regular use—especially when operating the mouse wheel— but it is low enough that it is never a problem.The top of the mouse has a smooth, plastic matte finish on the that helps prevents the hand from getting hot or sweaty. The thumb grip is covered by a textured rubber material that feels nice quite nice to the touch. The right side of the mouse, where the ring and pinky fingers rest, is a normal plastic.The mouse itself does feel a little heavier than your average wireless mouse, but I think that is a positive thing. Very light mice feel cheap. Most of the weight is centered around the palm where the battery is placed.BATTERY LIFE: I purchased this mouse back in February and I've only had to change the battery once, or twice at most. It is honestly so few that I can't remember using a mouse that had such longevity. What's especially surprising about this fact is there is no On/Off button. It simply turns itself off after being idle for a short while and immediately turns itself back on when you press a button.EASE OF USE/SETUP: Stick the receiver into your computer, press a button on the mouse, and you're done. It's that simple. The receiver is also extremely good and I never lose tracking.DURABILITY: I easily used this mouse for roughly 1500 hours since I bought it. It isn't uncommon for my wireless mice to literally fall apart in the span of a year or two. Typically the side or bottom panels start to come off and anything that is glued to it, especially rubber components, begin to peel away. Not ONE part of the surface level components failed me in that time.However, the left mouse began to double click at random after a year. I consider myself a power user when it comes to computers and mice. In the time it takes an average person to reach 1000 hours I do it in a fraction of the time. Despite the failure in the left mouse I still instantly purchased a new one when the problems arose. Why? Because for the price, performance, and quality this was a minor inconvenience. I've had numerous $60+ wired mice have double click problems that weren't half as good as this one.CONCLUSION: The combination of the price, build quality, battery life, ergonomics, and functionality makes this the best wireless mouse I've ever used. Period. In fact I'd put it in the top 3 best all around, with ease. Even with the left mouse failure after a year/~1500 hours of use I can't help but give this mouse a five star review. If, however, it was a more expensive mouse ($30+) I would knock off at least one star.\n"", ""\n  its really good with everyday usage , the range is really good , and it connects really easily . however i noticed if you move the mouse VERRRY VERRRY slowly then sometimes the cursor doesn't move which is annoying when you try to edit photos or crop something , this also means your'e not going to be as accurate if you play games like CS:GO. its really unnoticeable but other than that it's almost perfect.\n"", '\n  Waste of money. Doesnt feel comfortable, and louder than loud....\n', '\n  Good Design, I use it for work, worth the price! Cheers!\n', '\n  This mouse is very comfortable and easy to grab because of its perfect size.Its supports AA battery and WIFI is 2.4GHz, so uninterrupted range and connectivity.Its perfect for everyone because it has an inbuilt feature of adjustable CPI so we can change the sensitivity and cursor movement.value for money deal must buy if you are looking for a wireless optical mouse.give it a try.👍\n', ""\n  Product is as described. Feels really good to hold. The thumb contours are really well designed and have a soft rubber material. Overall, I'm happy woth the product.What could have been better?1. On/off switch - It's turns on when you press any button and turns off after certain time of inactivity. Probelm is when you keep it in a laptob bag/case, it might turn on due to unintended pressure.2. The back/forward keys could have been customizable for other functions.\n""]"

I have been forced to do more research and return this mouse for a larger more ergonomic mouse.\n', ""\n  \xa0I absolutely love everything about this wonderful/colorful mouse! The item arrived earlier than expected (which was a very nice surprise) and in perfect condition. I plugged it in and it was ready to go. I absolutely love the colors and the various ways you can choose how they are displayed as well as the ability to turn the colors off when you're not using it. It works perfectly with my work computer as well as my personal one and in the short time I've had it,  I've gotten so many comments about how beautiful the colors are.

I'm on the computer 12-16 hours per day, so having a great mouse is VERY important to me.  It clicks easily, with very little pressure, and that's an important feature. My previous mouse (a different brand) actually caused pain every day from having to press so hard.  I needed to replace it quickly, so I bought this one, and I'm very satisfied.  I didn't buy it because of the lights, but the colors are so hypnotic (Wow, man..!!) and very beautiful.  A terrific choice, and so affordable, too..!!\n"", '\n  Super quiet mouse.  My homeschooler was complaining about our other mouses, mice(?)Saying they didn’t click easily or they wouldn’t drag his cursor where be wanted it. This was a very budget friendly mouse with led that make homeschooling just a bit more fun.  There’s a separate control for the led, so you can turn it off if you don’t want to have the fancy lights.The mouse is not wireless, which I think is better for kids who tend to lose things that aren’t tethered.\n', '\n  I bought this mouse couple weeks ago because my old mouse was broken after it felt down the floor.

Very well made, plugged it into my laptop and it worked immediately. The mouse is very smooth, both physically and on the screen.

There is also a handy button that allows you to change color modes or turn off the light entirely. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good, basic mouse.\n', '\n  The RGB is really good such as the rainbow mode which spurs an interesting pattern of lighting effects. Contrary to what the description says, there seems to be a memory as in the lighting does not reset to original start point so disconnecting on breathing mode will make it restart on breathing mode upon replugging in. The DPI is a bit high by default (1600) so reduce sensitivity in games manually. Also the tracking speed cannot keep up with flick shot so FPS players beware. For office and casual gaming this is a fine addition to beautiful RGB.\n', '\n  This is a pretty good deal for an inexpensive mouse. it has rainbow lighting design with one button to adjust 4 RGB color effects, that is very beautify especially during night.It is comfortable in the hand and also light-weighted. The device has the right dpi setting to move cursor, so it feels great in use.The quiet clicking feature makes it very enjoyable for each of the silent clicking moment to avoid disturbing others.\n', ""\n  I buy this mouse because it is a quiet mouse. I use computer very late at night. I am afraid of making noise to disturb my family. After using it for days, I think this mouse with basic function at this price is very suitable for me.

The right and left click are quiet but the scroll wheel and light button are not quiet but that doesn't matter.\n"", '\n  I bought for my son. He use his notebook computer at least 8 hours every day, for online class learning  and playing. The old mouse works very slow and is not easy to use already anymore.

The buttons work nicely, the wheel scrolls smoothly and only makes a mild clicking, and it has a USB cable (I'm not a fan of wireless mice; they seem less reliable and require more maintenance in my experience). Plus, I was able to get mine for like $5 which was very nice! I was only after a basic, reliable computer mouse to replace my broken one and this one fits the bill! I've used it extensively since it arrived at my door and works wonderfully! My only qualm is that I would have liked for the cord to be a little longer, just to have enough slack to be extra safe, but so far it fits in with my current desktop setup so I won't complain.If you're in the market for a basic, corded mouse that operates smoothly and is comfortable to use, I highly recommend! It's nothing fancy, but it is responsive, comfortable, and I can't find any point of contention with it or its performance. I'm just glad such a simple corded is even still in production! Logitech has always made products I find to be useful and reliable, so I felt confident buying a mouse made by the company.I'll update this review in a few months time (or sooner, if there's a problem) just as a check in on its longevity and functionality over time!Update as of January 24th, 2018Everything is still working wonderfully after almost half a year of use!Update as of July 12th, 2018Still working perfectly almost a year in!Update as of January 2019My mouse began to do this strange thing where it'd simaltaneously right click as I left clicked, which caused me to accidentally select random parts of the right click menu while using my computer. Nothing I did corrected the issue in a way that would keep me using the mouse, so it is put to rest after about 18 months of daily use.The issue stopped when I switched my left click and right click controls to the opposite buttons, but as I am right handed, this was awkward, so I bought a new mouse. My only guess as to why this happened was that the components of the mouse where worn; there's not a super clear distinction between the left and right buttons (there's a single piece of plastic over the two that's just been cut down the middle) so perhaps wear and tear caused some warping that makes it so pressure on the left button side causes the mouse's sensors to feel like the right side is clicking.\n"", ""\n  Great for gaming and productivity. Good quality, perfect size and sensitivity. If you're cross-shopping the AmazonBasics 3-Button USB Wired Mouse, I would STRONGLY suggest getting this Logitech B100 mouse intead. The Amazon mouse acts erratically when flicking your wrist quickly, such as having to turn around quickly in an FPS game. Also the Logitech mouse is larger and more comfortable with extended usage. The Amazon mouse also has a weird rubberized-feeling plastic on the surface, the B100's glossy plastic is more preferable in my opinion.\n"", ""\n  I received the mouse and it worked great for about a month.  Then the left button started registering two or three clicks for each press of the mouse button.  It was truly maddening.  By the time I figured out what it was doing, I was beyond the 30 day return window to Amazon.  It is still within the manufacturer's guarantee, but it may be more trouble than it's worth to return it.  If you find your mouse apparently double clicking, try using it with an application like Microsoft's calculator.  It is easy to see the failure there.\n"", '\n  The Serial number is different in invoice and product. The box of the mouse has a modified sticker that shows same serial number like the invoice, but the serial number printed in the mouse is different. My earlier review was not posted as I have put in a proper word to describe this mismatch! Hope my selection of words is appropriate this time and the review will get posted to make others aware!Attached photo showing different serial number in mouse and box.\n', '\n  Fake. The serial numbers are different on box and on product. Both serial numbers do not exists on product locate at Logitech website.\n', ""\n  this mouse works fine, seems accurate/responsive.  I'm happy with it for general computer usage; email, word processing, presentation, webn browsing, etc\n"", ""\n  Logitech's products are the best no doubt. I have used all sorts of brands HP, Microsoft, Dell etc. but when it come to reliability and ease of use Logitech beats them all hand down.This is a simple generic mouse which is simply designed. the wheel is good in function and so is the mouse in general.The best part about Logitech is that the product will long laasssst. Unlike any other brand.\n"", ""\n  Have had this for months and months so far and it's been one of the best mouse i've ever used. The wheel has a soft touch, not hard plastic. The size is perfect too.\n""]"

I was really frustrated in the search.  It was then that I found the new Logitech Pebble and thought I would give it a try.I was pleasantly surprised to find that it not only was small, had a nice power switch to conserve energy and prevent errant mouse clicks while traveling, but it also had an included USB 3.0 dongle for older devices (internally stored in the battery compartment) that worked very well with the Windows Machine I sometimes use, and to top it all off... it is VERY quiet!  This is excellent as conducting patient documentation during a session requires quiet keyboard & devices so as not to interrupt or distract my patients.  I was so impressed, I have recommended to many friends/colleagues and have purchased a second mouse to leave at one office where I share space with another provider who also loves it!

Highly recommend, great product.\n', '\n  I will immediately call the pros and cons of my impressions.Positive:Innovative non-trivial form. Good color and material. Good for my modern Pixelbook.Lightweight and compact. This is an important plus when traveling or travelingPromises fulfilled (quiet and easy to switch from radio to Wi-Fi mode)Negative:A little ""thinking"" (pauses) when turned on. This, to me, is a noticeable drawbackIt takes some time to get used to the peculiar form factor.Result:Overall the impression is positive, I do not regret that I quickly bought and predict this mouse a good future)P.SIt is terrifyingly annoying when, after a few months of using the mouse, the rubber stickers on the bottom surface come off (this is a typical problem for Logitech). I hope that the new design of these stickers is much more reliable.\n', ""\n  It would be a great Bluetooth mouse if I could get it to pair with my MAC operating systems!  I have an iMAC and a Macbook Pro laptop, and I can't get this mouse to pair with either computers.  I went to Logitech's support page and saw several complaints about customers unable to pair it with their MAC systems.  It would have been nice for Logitech to mention that in their product description!  Will be sending it back tomorrow.\n"", ""\n  I purchased this mouse to pair with a Pixelbook Go Chromebook. It paired easily via Bluetooth and unlike some of the others I've tried, did not have issues reconnecting after suspending the Chromebook. The form factor is comfortable after long use. The mouse wheel works smoothly. Tracking is smooth across multiple surfaces including a mousepad, a hard plastic surface on my laptop stand, and even on the linen sheet on my bed. I don't have a way of checking the battery level, but it has been working fine for a month with about 4 hours use per day.I also tried this with a Linux Mint laptop on a Dell XPS 13 using the USB connector. This also worked without issue.\n"", '\n  I think it is super chic, sleek, and portable. I loved the color and how it is a subtle pink. The tracking is good and the mouse connects seamlessly to my Macbook Pro. The clicking was also very quiet, and I would recommend this product only for pc.As much as I loved it for my Macbook Pro, my intended reason was to also have it for my iPad 6th generation as a pointer device. Unfortunately, the mouse did not connect even after watching videos and looking at the instructions provided with the item. For this reason, I have returned the product.\n', ""\n  I own a ton of gaming mice and have tried dozens. Not saying this is one of them, basically just saying I know a good mice when I use it. I had several criteria when looking for a mobile mice, ranked in priority. 1. Bluetooth 2. Quiet 3. Battery life 4. Slim.1. Bluetooth. I need a mouse that has bluetooth to be compatible with my iPad (iOS 13, accessibility allows for mouse use). Otherwise I would have stuck with my other Logitech mice that has the dongle.2. Quiet. When I'm in the library, I've noticed how obnoxiously loud my clicks are for both myself and the people around me. Having used the Logitech M330 Silent Plus, that raised my standards for mice even higher when traveling.3. Battery life. Obviously a wireless mice is useless without battery. Logitech has great battery life on all their mices so it's a no brainer.4. Slim. Not a huge deal to me but an added bonus. I can stick this in my tech pouch without it deforming the bag.As you probably noticed by now, all of things I mentioned above are features the Pebble has. The closest thing is probably the Apple Magic Mouse 2 which also fits my criteria but the Pebble is quieter, longer battery life, and most importantly, cheaper.\n"", '\n  O mouse é muito bonito e com ótimo acabamento. Gosto de mouses um pouco mais pesados, para mim tem bom peso e precisão. O clique é suave e praticamente silencioso. Funcionou de primeira pelo conector USB. A conexão por Bluetooth também funcionou perfeitamente. Funciona com uma pilha comum, contudo, sugiro as alcalinas para maior durabilidade. Esta avaliação feita a partir das minhas primeiras impressões, assim que recebi o mouse.\n', '\n  Pontos Positivos:1. Não suja com facilidade (a não ser que você seja meio porcão, ai é rapidin kkk) ps: não sei como está limpo a tanto tempo assim na minha mão haha;2. Primeira pilha (que vem com o produto) durou por 04 meses -- vamos ver se as pilhas normais seguram tanto tempo assim a carga (lógico, desligando sempre depois que não for mais usar);3. Para a troca da pilha ou ter acesso ao pendrive de utilização wireless, é super prático e fácil tirar a parte de cima -- a parte de cima é juntada a de baixo com um imã escondidinho, então é uma maravilha;4. não é fragil --- Derrubei ele e ta tudo... certo até agora;5. Muito preciso o mouse;6. Super silencioso;Pontos Negativos:1. com 01 mês de uso deu um probleminha no Bluethooth dele, mas nada que pode estar resolvendo com o wireless... Hoje já estou utulizando ele novamente no bluethooth.2. Em minha opinião, poderia ser a batertia e não a pilha, assim seria mais fácil carregá-lo quando necessário e cotinuar usando.Grande abraço a todos os Nobres e muito obrigado pela atenção!\n', '\n  Comprei pra usar no tablet galaxy tab S6 via bluetooth, tinha lido alguns comentários sobre o stand by demorar a voltar mas pelo menos por aqui não aconteceu, ele é muito rápido, não teve delay até então, rapida conexão, nota 10!No começo é estranho o manuseio, parece antiergonomico, mas algumas hrs dps vc se acostuma e ele se torna leve a confortável.Não faz barulho mesmo!

(Plus its beautiful!!!)Well I got it in and was so excited only to be completely let down because the pointer was ""jerky"" on the screen and it was hard to maneuver.... BUT I am absolutely ECSTATIC to report that after a month of using it I FINALLY realized this morning that there are PROTECTOR FILMS ON THE BOTTOM of the mouse!!!! After removing them I am so happy to say that after going through 6 mouses in 3 months I am finally COMPLETELY SATISFIED with this one!!! Moral of my story... DON\'T BE A IDIOT LIKE ME AND REMOVE THE FILM PROTECTORS :)\n', '\n  Being one of the only IT guys in the family and among my group of friends; I often get asked questions on what are good tech products, after all some of these items are usually expensive and no one likes wasting money. With the past holiday season, I helped pick out laptops for nieces and nephews for school, gaming laptops for the friends, a custom made pc, and a slick new Macbook Pro. With all these new systems being bought, everyone’s next question is “What accessories should I purchase??”, I always suggest that anyone buying a laptop at least get a wireless mouse.I have used wireless mice for years; there are great mice, good mice, and downright awful mice. Most of the choices out there on the market are going to be based on what you personally like, what feels good to you, and what functions well.  I do a fair amount of travel for work and I have certain criteria for equipment to make it into my travel bag; after all I will be carrying that equipment around the airport from anywhere between 6-12 hours, so no junk allowed!!For a wireless mouse I look for the following:• Use on any surface laser• Skids that slide well with ease on multiple surfaces• Long term battery life• Small USB receiver• Comfort and size• And above all else PRICEThe VicTsing MM057 checks off all of my criteria and more! On top of having all the features I require from above it also has:• six (6) buttons, two of which are custom programmable which means you can make them do whatever you’d like!!• On the Fly Adjustable DPI – this means you can adjust the sensitivity whenever you’d like, which is great if you like to play video games, this feature can come in handy.• 2.4GHz wireless with a 15-foot reach, so you can easily use this for a media center pc while sitting comfortably on the sofa.VicTsing got it right with the MM057, it is super comfortable in the hand, it’s large enough to provide good support to help prevent hand fatigue, and groves for your thumb and ring and pinky fingers (sorry lefties this is right handed only), it has a really soft rubber coating, smooth gliding action, and an ultra crisp scrolling wheel and button clicks. I tested the MM057 on PC and Mac, it was plug and play on both, which means you will be using your new mouse in seconds. I like to carry my laptop around with me throughout the day and the MM057 worked on every surface I put it on which allowed me to be truly mobile and move about how I wanted without having to carry around a mouse pad and worry about a flat surface, the MM057 will work on your jeans just fine if you are so inclined.Another major plus is using a single AA battery as the power source, not only are these more common to find around the office/home than AAA but in my experience the AA tend to last longer in mice and you only need one versus the two you would usually need for AAA. There is convenient storage for the Micro USB receiver on the bottom of the mouse, so if you choose to unplug the receiver there is a safe place to store it so it does not get lost. The adaptor is a great size, it is slim-line enough to leave plugged in all the time, even when you need to carry your laptop around in your bag or briefcase without fear of it breaking off.This is one of my favorite mice; I give it 5 out of 5 because it deserves it. It is a great mouse for a great price. I recommend them to friends and family, and VicTsing stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty. Buy with confidence, great product, great price, and fast shipping.\n', ""\n  I'm a gamer, and this was meant more for my girlfriend who does simple browsing and maybe typing some documents.For me, this would definitely not be enough, but I would obviously go for something more involved - like a mouse with 500 buttons and serves me Mountain Dew and orders pizza for me.But if you're like my absolutely terrifying girlfriend, and you do basic things on your pc or mac, this definitely works and it's cheap. No problems after over a year of ownership.Oh, if you have hands the size of Donald Trump's, you may enjoy it more. People of the large-handed sort are going to find it uncomfortable. It's pretty compact.\n"", ""\n  I've purchased no less than a dozen wireless mice over the years and nothing else comes close to this one.ERGONOMICS/COMFORT: I'm a man with medium sized hands and it is difficult to find a mouse that isn't too large or too small. Fortunately for me this mouse fits PERFECTLY in my hand, allowing me to easily rest my ring and pinky fingers on it. In terms of ergonomics it is one of the most comfortable mice I've ever used, be it wired or not.DESIGN/BUILD: The scroll wheel isn't loud and has a nice texture to it. It's also very responsive, which is hard to find in a lower budget mouse. The left side buttons are positioned in a good spot so that I don't have to make an effort to use either of them. There is a DPI button located in the top center of the mouse. Often these buttons can be hit on accident during regular use—especially when operating the mouse wheel— but it is low enough that it is never a problem.The top of the mouse has a smooth, plastic matte finish on the that helps prevents the hand from getting hot or sweaty. The thumb grip is covered by a textured rubber material that feels nice quite nice to the touch. The right side of the mouse, where the ring and pinky fingers rest, is a normal plastic.The mouse itself does feel a little heavier than your average wireless mouse, but I think that is a positive thing. Very light mice feel cheap. Most of the weight is centered around the palm where the battery is placed.BATTERY LIFE: I purchased this mouse back in February and I've only had to change the battery once, or twice at most. It is honestly so few that I can't remember using a mouse that had such longevity. What's especially surprising about this fact is there is no On/Off button. It simply turns itself off after being idle for a short while and immediately turns itself back on when you press a button.EASE OF USE/SETUP: Stick the receiver into your computer, press a button on the mouse, and you're done. It's that simple. The receiver is also extremely good and I never lose tracking.DURABILITY: I easily used this mouse for roughly 1500 hours since I bought it. It isn't uncommon for my wireless mice to literally fall apart in the span of a year or two. Typically the side or bottom panels start to come off and anything that is glued to it, especially rubber components, begin to peel away. Not ONE part of the surface level components failed me in that time.However, the left mouse began to double click at random after a year. I consider myself a power user when it comes to computers and mice. In the time it takes an average person to reach 1000 hours I do it in a fraction of the time. Despite the failure in the left mouse I still instantly purchased a new one when the problems arose. Why? Because for the price, performance, and quality this was a minor inconvenience. I've had numerous $60+ wired mice have double click problems that weren't half as good as this one.CONCLUSION: The combination of the price, build quality, battery life, ergonomics, and functionality makes this the best wireless mouse I've ever used. Period. In fact I'd put it in the top 3 best all around, with ease. Even with the left mouse failure after a year/~1500 hours of use I can't help but give this mouse a five star review. If, however, it was a more expensive mouse ($30+) I would knock off at least one star.\n"", ""\n  its really good with everyday usage , the range is really good , and it connects really easily . however i noticed if you move the mouse VERRRY VERRRY slowly then sometimes the cursor doesn't move which is annoying when you try to edit photos or crop something , this also means your'e not going to be as accurate if you play games like CS:GO. its really unnoticeable but other than that it's almost perfect.\n"", '\n  Waste of money. Doesnt feel comfortable, and louder than loud....\n', '\n  Good Design, I use it for work, worth the price! Cheers!\n', '\n  This mouse is very comfortable and easy to grab because of its perfect size.Its supports AA battery and WIFI is 2.4GHz, so uninterrupted range and connectivity.Its perfect for everyone because it has an inbuilt feature of adjustable CPI so we can change the sensitivity and cursor movement.value for money deal must buy if you are looking for a wireless optical mouse.give it a try.👍\n', ""\n  Product is as described. Feels really good to hold. The thumb contours are really well designed and have a soft rubber material. Overall, I'm happy woth the product.What could have been better?1. On/off switch - It's turns on when you press any button and turns off after certain time of inactivity. Probelm is when you keep it in a laptob bag/case, it might turn on due to unintended pressure.2. The back/forward keys could have been customizable for other functions.\n""]"

It's a little smaller than my last but I'm sure it will feel natural in my hand soon enough.  Love the near-silence!  No more obnoxious Click-Click-Click.  Lightweight and very basic, no side buttons, not even an on/off button.  Didn't think I would like that at first, but that it goes into sleep mode is actually pretty convenient.  Right or left click to wake it up.  Seems the red light (underneath) stays on all the time, even in sleep mode.  Feel like that should drain the battery... remains to be seen.  Regardless, I use rechargeable batteries.  For the price, this was a great buy.UPDATE 7/22/19:  The light staying on DOES drain the battery, it lasted only 6 days.  Fortunately I use rechargeable batteries but this still isn't acceptable.  Bummer, because I quite like it in every other way.  From 5 stars to 1 star unless mine is just defective and Amazon replaces it with one that works properly.  Meanwhile, I have to pull the battery every time I walk away, which is far less convenient than turning it off by a switch.UPDATE 7/26/19  Amazon sent a replacement immediately, seems to work fine.  Red light no longer staying on all the time, it goes out when mouse sleeps.  Defects happen.  Changing rating back to 5 stars.UPDATE 8/21/19  As another reviewer said, mine also goes to sleep WHILE I'm using it.  Not a big deal (for me) but still weird.UPDATE: 4/27/20  Replacement still working fine.  Rarely goes to sleep while actually in use.  But just an added note -- this isn't an especially precise mouse, sometimes detailed edit work can be frustrating.  Is otherwise fine for basic functions.\n"", ""\n  A purchased this even though was a bit on the cheap side because the reviews seemed decent.Popped in a fresh battery, I plugged it into the laptop, used it once and it worked fine.  Went to use it a couple days later the light on the bottom shows its on and it works when it wants to and only when it wants to.  Then though everything was lit it stopped working entirely.

It works great for all my needs with no issues. I appreciate that I can use it in class without disturbing or annoying any of my classmates because of the silent click feature. Yes, there\'s no ""off"" button but that has not been an issue. I\'m still using the original battery I put in when it arrived and that was about 4 months ago now. It would be nice to turn it off sometimes because I have a toddler who has an affinity for my mouse whenever he sees it and especially when he sees the light but like I said, it really isn\'t much of an issue and I take this back and forth to school. Don\'t get discouraged by the lack of a power switch because this is a great mouse, one of the best ones I\'ve ever owned. I definitely encourage you to order one!\n', '\n  I bought this mouse in October 2019 and was happy to see that there was a lifetime warranty. Now in November, the mouse has stopped working. There is no information on the site regarding who to contact to retrieve the warrantee/refund/replacement after 30 days.

The soft silicone feel keeps your hands comfortable for long use, and the slot to store the USB plug when the mouse is not in use is very convenient and is behind a cover to prevent it from falling out. This was the cheapest wireless mouse I found (broke college kid struggles) and I was very impressed by the overall feel and performance of it. I use it with my MacBook pro. I have to use an adapter for the USB port, but most people woth macs have an adapter already, so it's no hassle!!!\n"", '\n  Da ich schon eine Bluetooth Maus von Seenda habe, kaufte ich diese günstige Maus. Sie ist wirklich leise, liegt gut in der Hand und ist auch schnell mal für unterwegs eingepackt. Die Farbe ist toll :) Kann ich nur empfehlen.\n', '\n  Leicht ist das Teil, leise und sie schaltet sich sogar zum Stromsparen bei Nichtaktivität ab. Dazu ein sehr guter Preis. Warum keine 5 Sterne? Weil sie im Vergleich zu meiner bisherigen Microsoft Maus etwas weniger präzise arbeitet.\n', '\n  Schöne Farbe und Aufbewahrungsmöglichkeit für den USB in der Maus, was eine tolle Idee. Für unterwegs mega praktisch. Gut, dass ich meine alte Maus verloren habe und dieses Produkt gekauft habe. ☺️\n', '\n  Ich habe die Maus gekauft, weil ich die Farbe super fand. Im Handling ist sie klasse und kann auch gut mitgenommen werden. Bis jetzt hat sie reibungslos und ohne Aussetzer funktioniert.\n', '\n  Die Maus liegt gut in der Hand, ist super für kleinere Hände geeignet. Sie ist wahrlich geräuschlos. Ich finde sie total klasse und würde wieder bestellen.\n']"
