I plan to carry Surface Pro 6 tablet with accessories, gym clothes with shoes, and my lunch, coffee mug and water bottle. Everything I need in one place. This backpack looks great, seems very well made and has a lifetime replacement warranty.\n', ""\n  I love this backpack. I recently bought it after using north face. It has a modern design and looks very sturdy. I am a student and the backpack fits my laptop well. It's also very handy when I need to travel. I just put it on top of my luggage bag. The anti-theft feature is a plus. Highly recommend.\n"", '\n  This backpack is very stylish, not too big/bulky, and it has plenty of storage space for a laptop, tablet(s), books, and/or anything else you need to take with you on the go.  I have used this backpack for work on occasion (though I usually prefer a messenger-style bag or briefcase for work), I\'ve also used this backpack for hiking as well as biking.  I definitely will use this backpack for traveling too.  The combo lock for the zipper of main compartment is cute but hardly ""anti-theft.""  I have tested the backpack for water resistance and it passed! (Heavy rain is A-OK, I do not recommend submerging this backpack however).  The USB and headphone plugs are definitely a huge plus!  I highly recommend this backpack.\n', '\n  If you want your backpack to make a ""statement"" about how smart, cool and rich you are, you might not want to buy this - buy a Tumi or another of the high end brands, they will cost you at least 10 times as much. If, on the other hand, you don\'t care about statements but just want a well designed and made backpack that has some flexibility for your changing life, and you know a great deal when you see it, the Tzowla is for you. The backpack has 2 large compartments, each with pockets, some zipped, inside for small items. The larger of the 2 compartments contains a padded laptop pocket that can accept up to a 17 in laptop, with a velcro\'ed retainer strap over the top. This retainer is not really functional for small laptops - there\'s too much free strap when the Velcro is fastened. There is space in the rest of the larger compartment for a small coat (say, a plastic waterproof) and a bag lunch. This compartment also has 2 stand-out features - 1. wired connectors for buddies/headphones and for charging a device. (You connect a power block inside the bag, then you can charge your device outside the bag, maybe even while you are using it.) It\'s a little bit gimmicky, but could be useful; and 2. a combination lock - again, could be useful. The smaller of the 2 large compartments is perfect for 1 or 2 books, headphones, kindle/iPad and for travel papers. On the outside of the smaller large compartment is a small easy-access pocket for glasses (reading and sun), passport and phone. There are side pockets for an umbrella (with a retainer strap) and a water bottle, and there is a fixed strap across the front of the bag to secure it on a rollaboard case. The shoulder straps are padded and spread the load well, and there are side straps with clips to compress the volume of the bag to a minimum. The whole bag is made of hard wearing fabric (only black, I think) with a waterproof, spongeable lining, seams are nicely sewn and all of the compartments close with good quality zips and the bag looks good when worn.. Since I have just received my bag, I have not rated it for durability, but it looks like it will last for years. For under $30, look no further.\n', '\n  Perfect size, great look, awesome quality,  roomy, holds my Dell inspiron 15.6 laptop perfectly. Light weight. Pretty safe and easy to use combination Lock.\n', ""\n  I've already traveled with this bag a few times and I like it a lot. The reason I'm not giving it a perfect score is because on the first trip, the wire for the headphone port popped out of place and I couldn't use my headphones through the bag. On the second trip, the same thing happened to the charger port wire. I was able to wiggle that one back into place, but the headphone port seems to be a bit more challenging to fix.It was off-putting to have such a unique feature fail so early in the bag's life. My advice is if you insert a charge wire or your headphones into these ports, do it very delicately.Otherwise, great bag.\n"", '\n  Very nice traveling back pack. I gotta admit that I thought the portable charger would be included but of course is not expectable for this price. But the seller should point that out clearly.\n', ""\n  This could be the best invention ever. We got next day delivery because my son could not wait. We also got the battery pack to charge the backpack. My sons a teenager so he comes home everyday with a dead phone. Not with this backpack. He fit all of his stuff in there with room to spare. The headphone jack, the phone charger and the locking zippers work perfectly. We could not be happier with this backpack. It's worth every penny. I would recommend this to anyone with teenagers, college kids and to all my nursing friends.\n"", ""\n  I was looking for a daypack that I can use for our cruise to the coastal countries of Western Europe and based on the reviews I chose the Tzowla. It weighs less than 1kg and can easily hold all of my electronic toys for our trip and  day excursions.  I really liked that the main compartment can be locked and that it has a luggage strap to prevent it from flopping around as you are making your way through the airport.  The water bottle holder on the outside is very convenient too.  The inside of the main compartment has a space for your Chromebook or Laptop and what I found really kool, was that it has a space to put my electronics charger and my mobile phone from where they can both be easily connected to the outlets located on the outside of the backpack.This backpack comes with a lifetime warranty and for that reason I gave it 5 stars for durability. It's only water resistant as opposed to waterproof but I don't expect to be doing much walking in a downpour. The zippers are the self-healing type which is a plus. The only things that I would like Tzowla to add to this backpack is to make one of the inside or outside pockets RFID Blocking. It would also be nice to add a strap to connect the padded straps to keep them from possibly sliding on your shoulders but this is a very minor issue.So YES, I would definitely buy this product again.\n"", '\n  Very nice backpack, like how small and compact it is and the option to make it more compact with straps at the sides. Perfect for carrying an ultra book with accessories, to and from work. Couple improvements i’d like, get rid of the cheesy brand logo, more padding in the shoulder straps and include a chest strap. Replaced the logo patch with velcro, now i can enjoy anything on there. Other than that, love the bag and use it every day\n', '\n  This backpack is a perfect companion for my travelings.It’s internal space and divisions are perfect for bringing my portable consoles, tablet, notebook and drawing materials as well!\n', ""\n  Très satisfait dans l'ensemble de ce sac à dos. Je l'utilise tous les jours. Le sac est suffisamment grand pour contenir une paire de souliers et d'autres effets.  La serrure est un plus. J'apprécie également la prise usb pour brancher mon chargeur portable qui  est rangé dans une pochette prévue à cet effet.Very satisfied in all of this backpack. I use it everyday. The bag is big enough to hold a pair of shoes and other effects. The lock is a plus. I also appreciate the USB plug to connect my portable charger which is stored in a pocket provided for this purpose.\n"", '\n  I ordered this backpack for an upcoming trip overseas and was slightly disappointed by the overall size of the backpack, especially the side pouches where a water bottle could go. The side pouches are quite tight and I doubt that a reusable water bottle would fit without some difficulty. However, the overall build quality is quite good as the materials feel sturdy and the zippers look strong. Getting the lock to work was simple using the provided instructions and it does seem quite strong. Overall, I am happy with the purchase and the free shipping through Amazon Prime and I will provide an update if anything changes after my trip!\n']"

My son had use it for two months now. The backpack is very heavy this year, and it's still holding. The gray and orange color are just like in the picture. The wheels work well and I love the many pockets it has. It's been a  very good experience. If it ever breaks, I'd buy again.\n"", ""\n  We bought this for our 4yr old's 1st plane ride! Easy to roll for her and big enough for a week's worth of clothing&some. She loves it!!\n"", '\n  \xa0Their are so many things to like about this bag that it’s a shame the wheels make it practically worthless. There are two wheels on each side 4 in total.  They are very loose and wobble then they  come apart and get jammed against each other and stop rolling.  The same exact thing happened on both sides leading me to think the wheels were not manufactured correctly or the adhesive that holds them together is no good.UPDATE!!  I glued the wheels together with a hot glue gun and it seems to have worked great!When I went to return it to Amazon they issued me a credit and  they said they didn’t even want me to send it back.  So I decided to see how well the rest of the bag was constructed.  I loaded it up with 30lbs and started to abuse it  It wasn’t exactly a real life process (lots of swinging around dropping dragging on the useless wheels).  Surprisingly it held up very well.  It looks like the secret is that the plastic that holds things together like the wheels ,retractable handle etc is very thin and not rigid at all , this seems to let things bend and flex rather than break.  ( I’m not sure if this is by design or far more likely the cost , regardless it appears to work)I then took a 5 gallon bucket and eventually was able to fit it into the bag and close the zipper.  I was literally pulling and stretching with all my strength to get it in.  The stitching stretched in a few spots but didn’t tear or separate significantly.  I had to use vise grips to close the zippers as I was stuffing the bucket inside.  The only issues were the tabs that you use to operate the zippers broke off  (  I really cannot fault the bag because I was pulling on the tabs with vise grips 🤐) but I was still able to get it closed without any more damage.  I was still able to fit 2 medium towels in the front pocket relatively easilyAll in all  I was pleasantly surprised by its construction  If only the wheels and wheel assembly wasn’t crap  then this bag would definitely be worth every penny.UPDATE!  I used hot glue gun to glue the wheels together and it seems to have worked well.Although my abuse of the bag doesn’t scientifically duplicate long term use of the bag it certainly was impressive to me  And a lot of fun  I think I may have found my calling !!!  Just in case anyone at Amazon reads this  I could use a new job😀\n', ""\n  Bought this for my son. He absolutely loves it. Material seems good. Zippers open and close nicely. And bag overall is good and sturdy. And very roomy for my sons stuff. Now when his bag gets too heavy he can just use the wheel to roll the bag. I'm very happy with this purchase.\n"", '\n  \xa0Handles stuck and Seller refused to return itemThe handles does not move up and down freely , it gets stuck going down . I have to press the little button at the end to move the handles down with a struggle . This is clearly defective and I immediately asked for a refund . Amazon email me the refund labels right away and then I received 3 emails from Seller plus a call from Seller who asked me to hold on to the item , do not return to Amazon , and also he said if it is returned to Amazon I will not see any refund. I described how effective this bagis , issues with handles , then the person on the phone said it seems to be manufacturer defect he will contact the manufacturer meantime I still cannot mail the defective bag back to Amazon.  Not a pleasant experience .\n', '\n  Been looking for a quality rolling backpack for my travels that I can fit the world into. This is it!!! I absolutely LOVE it. It has everything I wanted, good quality rollers and materials. It has survived several trips already. Looks professional as well.\n', '\n  I have these backpacks for my daughters, and let me tell you they are NOT gentle with them on our walks to and from school. I wanted to put them through the gamut to make sure that they were durable, as I wanted to start using them as emergency 72 hour backpacks for our storage as well. But I didn\'t want to invest in 6 different bags for emergency situations, if they didn\'t hold up to some abuse. Obviously I don\'t let them throw it down the stairs or anything seriously damaging, but I don\'t make them baby them for sure. We walk several blocks over rough surface roads to and from school each day. They like to ""jump"" the bags onto the curbs, etc. These bags have held up beautifully for nearly a year and a half and have virtually no wear and tear on them. There is plenty of storage, the handle extends and closes smoothly, and the wheels have held up great. Considering most backpacks in my four kids school careers only last half the year before getting holes and damage, I\'m impressed with the quality and durability of these bags. The ONLY thing I don\'t love about them, is the prices changes. The price is constantly fluctuating, which can get annoying when looking to buy and it has skyrocketed. It can go from as low as 19.99, to 32 bucks in a matter of weeks. So, my advice, if you have time to be patient, watch the page carefully and buy when it is at its lower prices.\n', ""\n  I've had this product for 9 days. It is a lot bigger inside than I thought it would be. So far it has endured what I have put it through. Day in and day out it is loaded with 3 massive text books including the Income Tax Act, my tablet, a binder full of paper, and other small objects all at one time. I've made it across parking lots and through libraries.It has walked miles and miles with me, including a trip to a hotel casino where it endured the parking garage. The wheels got caught in an expansion joint and that pulled the handle out of my hand and made me drop the backpack on its back. It then kept up with the forever walk across the casino to the hotel. All of this with my text books in it. They're heavy.The legs and wheel base are tall enough for it to sit off the ground. There are metal bars supporting between the wheel base and legs. I'm a firm believer that this is what has kept my text books from breaking the whole assembly. The two mesh pockets on the outside of the bag carry 2 500ml bottles of water each. I've had nothing go wrong yet! Even the zippers have held.If it can get through mid December without any issues, then hopefully I can come back with a good update!Update Oct 24: Still going strong. I've even lifted the bag a lot by the top handle, while its jammed full with almost 4000 pages. Mainly I roll it along. Still working fine. Tip: tuck the straps in to the back pocket that covers the handle assembly. I've been doing this from day 1 with no issues.Update: Jan 14th/18 This product got me through 3 months of carrying 4000+ pages, and it had a lot of wear and tear placed upon it, yet it is still going strong! All of the zippers and handles are intact and nothing has broke! I have a bit of separation between 2 of the wheels on the bottom. There are 4 wheels total but they are placed side by side as 2 pairs. The wheels are on plastic rims and 2 of the wheels have parted just a bit. It doesn't affect performance of the product as both wheels and the tiny rim are intact.I would 100% buy from this maker again.\n"", ""\n  For the price it's brill\n"", '\n  Pretty good backpack for school.  Attractive designs.  Main compartment is quite roomy -- can fit binders, text books, Chromebook, and small instrument -- but has less compartments of different sizes compared to some backpacks.  Side pockets are made of mesh material.  When we received the backpack, the retractable handle was stuck.  Kid managed to eventually get the handle to extend to its full length using some force and the weight of a full bag.  Depending on the height and arm length of the user, the retractable handle may not be long enough.  Biggest annoyance is the two front legs at the bottom of the bag are shorter than the rear wheels, which cause the bag to lean forward so much that the bottom front part of a fully stuffed bag is touching the floor.\n', '\n  This was a great bag for my kids in Europe. They could roll it, but also use it as a backpack up stairs, etc. The BIG problem was the straps drag when rolling so they scuff on the ground. Put straps were so worn they were almost to the point of breaking. We continuously tucked them in the side pockets but they would fall out. It needs some way to tuck away the straps when not in use. While I loved the concept - I would not buy this particular model again due to the strap issue.\n', ""\n  After barely a month of use, the handle bar is already breaking off the wheels. This was only holding the books of my Grade 3 son, who has been using it daily for school. Nothing heavy duty. Also he goes to a small private school, meaning he isn't rolling it down long hallways. ALSO I drive him to school, meaning he doesnt drag it to school all the way each day.Very disappointing.\n""]"

For such a low price, the fabric feels extremely durable both inside and outside. Zippers don't feel cheap like nearly every other bag I've used for school. My 15.6in laptop fits perfectly and the middle pocket is perfect for storing the charging cable, mouse, wallet, and keys. The smallest pocket is a great size for writing utensils, flash cards, cellphone, chapstick, etc. The shade of purple is nearly the exact shade in the picture which I was very happy about! All in all, I'm very excited to use this bag for this semester and I'm confident it will last longer than 1 semester!\n"", ""\n  This bag turned out to be a wonderful purchase. I took it on my recent trip to Germany and carried it with me almost every day, almost everywhere I went. It was one of my carry-ons on the white and it held way more than I expected it to. I had one full size laptop and it's cord, a tablet and its cord, two phones and both the Chargers, a book, a water bottle, and so many other things that all fit easily into this one bag. It's comfortable to wear and the port to plug in and charge your phone from was very nice. That ended up being very helpful several points in time but buyer beware you must have your own charger brick to plug into inside the bag. I utilized both outside side pockets at some point, the two front pockets turned out to be very useful and I really enjoy that there is a separated and slightly padded  pouch pocket on the inside of the bag. I will caution you, it is very easy to make this bag very heavy because of how much space it has. The only thing that I didn't like was I wish there was a pocket in the top flap of the bag. Nothing big but just something there. Preferably on the inside so there was still a safety element to my stuff but just another pocket somewhere on the top flap would have been useful. It has also proven time and again that it is at the very least water-resistant if not waterproof. I was out in multiple heavy rains and nothing inside the bag got wet.I definitely recommend this. I will probably buy another colors. I am even still using it almost daily since I got back and it's been over a month.\n"", '\n  I travel pretty often for work and needed a slim  backpack that would fit my laptop. I was searching on amazon and came across this backpack and loved the design. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and it’s holding up well so far. There’s a zipper inside for the main compartment with a magnetic-snap belt flap on the front. It also has slightly padded adjustable shoulder straps. It’s pretty roomy with a total of 4 compartments and 2 side pockets that can hold your water bottle or phone. It also has an external USB with built-in charging cable, but you need to purchase your own power bank. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase!\n', '\n  I bought this backpack to take to work every day. I liked that the backpack had different pockets and had a laptop sleeve inside. However, the third day that I used it one of the straps broke. Frustrated, I took it to a reputable seamstress to be repaired since I was out of my return window (I bought it on Prime Day, but did not return to work until September). After it had been repaired, the other strap ripped the second day I used the repaired bag. This backpack has now proven to be a complete waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone.\n', '\n  I never write reviews, but for this backpack I want to!

It couldn't fit my 15 inch laptop, despite being advertised as such. The straps were absurdly short too, such that the padded part only came to the top of my shoulders and the black canvas strap used for adjusting the size of the straps was what actually held the weight of the bag. My normal water bottle couldn't fit in the side pockets, and upon further investigation I couldn't even get a typical water bottle (like the kind you'd get out of a vending machine) to slip inside without a huge amount of effort.It was just generally unusable. It might make a nice backpack for a child, assuming they don't have a laptop or enjoy carrying around beverages.Had a strong chemical scent. Might decrease with time - I wouldn't know.

It looks lovely, the material is sturdy, I love the colors (I picked green), and it has 3 separate sections, which I was looking for. But I don't love it. The main problem is that  it will not stand upright. It falls over on its front no matter what. I don't have anything super heavy in the middle pocket, just a wallet and sunglasses, but the back section is so skinny that it is always front-heavy. It falls forward with such force that it is almost comical, if it wasn't so irritating. The only thing I can fit in the very front pocket is lip balm. The opening is so narrow and the zipper is so rough and scratchy that I have difficulty even trying to slide in my phone and I can't possibly get my keys in. I even have difficulty fitting my keys into the side pockets.\n"", '\n  Just what I wanted. Only one large pocket, but I was looking for a smaller bag.

Minecraft, Roblox and even Fortnite aren't as cool anymore - at least not on his backpacks, and fitting in and not standing out is everything. As a parent we are learning that being the same as everyone else, but also finding a way to stand out, is everything to a middle schooler.That's where the Under Armour Unisex Hustle 4.0 Backpack comes into play for us... our son likes that is is subtly branded but still low-key. He doesn't have to worry about there being anything for the other kids to make fun of, but also it stands out as being a good quality, good brand backpack.As parents, we also had some requirements - like, well - you know... is it a good backpack? Fortunately, it is an excellent backpack. It has padding for the now-required chromebook in sixth grade so it won't be easily broken in the real world abuse of a sixth-grader's backpack. It has lots of different sized compartments and good zippers that make it easy to access the different sections.Another very important aspect of the Under Armour Hustle 4.0 backpack is that more and more experts are saying that our kids are carrying too much weight around school on their backs. This backpack is very well designed to distribute that weight so that it doesn't cause as much effort to my son's back. I believe there is a good chance that it is better for his back than some of the less well-designed backpacks out there. It is clear that Under Armour has done some serious research in how to design the straps to distribute the loading more efficiently on your back with this pack.I am very impressed with the overall quality of the backpack and give it a solid five stars.I hope you find this to be a helpful review.

Thank you!\n"", '\n  I ordered this looking for a bag to take in the morning onto campus and carry all day with my books, notebooks, 13"" laptop, shaker, protein, water bottle, gym clothes, gym shoes, and towel in it.Got it in, initially I was disappointed because it looked like in the photos that the back and straps had mesh lining to reduce back and strap sweat, but it didn\'t have that. Straps and back are a slick polyester material and would not breathe at all.Biggest disappointment was when I put my size 8.5 running shoes in the bottom compartment. They barely fit (if you had 12s you\'d be squishing them length-wise a bit), and once they\'re in they take up the bottom 25-30% of the bag\'s internal space. You can probably get a binder or a couple thinner books in with shoes, because there is a small gap left between the back of the bag and the shoe compartment that they could squeeze into, but more than an 1-1.5"" of depth would start squishing your shoes.The second biggest flaw is the bag is not deep (away from the back) and cannot expand. My hope was the secondary compartment would hold my gym clothes and a towel, but there\'s not even close to enough depth to get it all in there. To get all of my stuff in the bag would have required carrying a shaker and a bottle on the outside, and all of my gym clothes and books plus laptop in the main compartment.I would not recommend this bag to anyone trying to do what I was doing. If you just need a bag for a laptop and gym stuff you\'d be fine, but if you want to separate your gym clothes from your books and other things, plus be able to carry a pair of shoes I\'d look elsewhere. If the shoe compartment didn\'t take up so much internal room it\'d be okay, but adding shoes kills its functionality.\n', ""\n  While going through Customs in the UK, the Agent who was dealing with me pulled my bag out for extra scrutiny and asked me a few questions about it... not the bag's contents, mind you. The bag. He said he's looking for a new backpack and his job has let him examine a bunch of different kinds. He decided he liked mine. Luckily, he was a proper British Customs agent, and not the TSA, otherwise I might have never seen it again.\n"", '\n  This bag TORE at the seam.

I thought this was going to be perfect!!  However the shoes go on the bottom supposedly out of the way, but low and behold they go up into the bag taking up the room where the binder fits snuggly next to the chrome book. Nowhere does it say the shoes go up I the bag, it says on the bottom.  False advertising at its finest and of course we are out of the window to return to amazon because we didn’t change into this backpack in time. So disappointed\n', '\n  The red looks pink\n', '\n  My son who just started high school needed a backpack for school.

More pockets than I could ever ask for, for a bag that looks so aesthetically pleasing. If I was to find any improvement for it, I would add an optional chest strap, although thanks to the 'thumb loops' in the adjustable straps, I have managed to loop them through one another to hack this too. Highly recommend! 🙌\n"", '\n  I am so happy that I purchased this bag. My son started high school this year and it was a struggle to fit everything in the bag I bought him. He was having to carry his trainers for PE separately. My son is not the best at carrying things and has a tenancy to lose things so I really wanted everything in one bag. This bag has resolved our problem. My son fits his school work, large pencil case and long lunch box in one compartment. His outdoor PE kit and rain jacket in the second compartment and his trainers in the compartment at the bottom of the bag. The water bottle holders on the outside are a nice deep size. There are also a couple of small pockets on the front. He keeps his mobile phone in one and his snack for break time in the other. My son struggles with organisation, this bag has helped him be more organised.\n', '\n  Terrific backpack and is Ideal for work.The Hustle 4.0 back pack bag easily fits my iPad Pro 2 with its case on and there is still more room in the laptop pocket (so a 15inch screen laptop would easily fit), my lunch, my over ear blue tooth headphones and soft case, phone, charger, cable, glasses and other items.It has a sturdy grab handle at the top.It also has two front pockets, one at the top which is smaller and is ideal for keys and change and another one below which is larger. Both are lined in a soft fleecy type grey material for added protection if you wanted to keep a mobile phone in them or a power bank. The Hustle also comes with two water bottle pouches on each outer side of the bag and two large compartments inside.The slightly smaller compartment of the two at the front has two tidy pockets inside which is ideal for pens, cables, tissues etc.The rest of the compartment just in front of the two tidy pockets is where I keep my headphones,glasses, phone charger etc.The larger compartment at the back includes the laptop/tablet pocket is which is padded for extra protection.In front of that is the rest of the compartment. I use that bit for an A3 sized notebook and my lunch! At the base of the bag at the front is a wet pocket which has a double zip for easy access. All the zips have soft grab tags for easy use.The material is tough and it is water resistant and is comfortable when carried on my back. The straps are adjustable.It is a nice compact bag, looks good, is not too bulky and is just the right size for an every day carry.I’ve only had it about three weeks but I’m happy with it so far. Even at full price (£45) it would be worth it. Currently £35. If your looking for a decent everyday back pack at a reasonable price this is it.\n', '\n  Needed a new bag for general sports stuff and thought that this would fit the bill.  After a couple of weeks use now I can say it definitely fits the bill and looks smart too.  The various compartments are well made and it easily carries my sports kit, lunch, keys wallets, pens and a host of other stuff every day.  I would recommend it for every day sports use but not for walking or anything you would do to have it on your back all day.\n']"

I definitely will use this backpack for traveling too.  The combo lock for the zipper of main compartment is cute but hardly ""anti-theft.""  I have tested the backpack for water resistance and it passed! (Heavy rain is A-OK, I do not recommend submerging this backpack however).  The USB and headphone plugs are definitely a huge plus!  I highly recommend this backpack.\n', '\n  If you want your backpack to make a ""statement"" about how smart, cool and rich you are, you might not want to buy this - buy a Tumi or another of the high end brands, they will cost you at least 10 times as much. If, on the other hand, you don\'t care about statements but just want a well designed and made backpack that has some flexibility for your changing life, and you know a great deal when you see it, the Tzowla is for you. The backpack has 2 large compartments, each with pockets, some zipped, inside for small items. The larger of the 2 compartments contains a padded laptop pocket that can accept up to a 17 in laptop, with a velcro\'ed retainer strap over the top. This retainer is not really functional for small laptops - there\'s too much free strap when the Velcro is fastened. There is space in the rest of the larger compartment for a small coat (say, a plastic waterproof) and a bag lunch. This compartment also has 2 stand-out features - 1. wired connectors for buddies/headphones and for charging a device. (You connect a power block inside the bag, then you can charge your device outside the bag, maybe even while you are using it.) It\'s a little bit gimmicky, but could be useful; and 2. a combination lock - again, could be useful. The smaller of the 2 large compartments is perfect for 1 or 2 books, headphones, kindle/iPad and for travel papers. On the outside of the smaller large compartment is a small easy-access pocket for glasses (reading and sun), passport and phone. There are side pockets for an umbrella (with a retainer strap) and a water bottle, and there is a fixed strap across the front of the bag to secure it on a rollaboard case. The shoulder straps are padded and spread the load well, and there are side straps with clips to compress the volume of the bag to a minimum. The whole bag is made of hard wearing fabric (only black, I think) with a waterproof, spongeable lining, seams are nicely sewn and all of the compartments close with good quality zips and the bag looks good when worn.. Since I have just received my bag, I have not rated it for durability, but it looks like it will last for years.

Pretty safe and easy to use combination Lock.\n', ""\n  I've already traveled with this bag a few times and I like it a lot. The reason I'm not giving it a perfect score is because on the first trip, the wire for the headphone port popped out of place and I couldn't use my headphones through the bag. On the second trip, the same thing happened to the charger port wire. I was able to wiggle that one back into place, but the headphone port seems to be a bit more challenging to fix.It was off-putting to have such a unique feature fail so early in the bag's life. My advice is if you insert a charge wire or your headphones into these ports, do it very delicately.Otherwise, great bag.\n"", '\n  Very nice traveling back pack. I gotta admit that I thought the portable charger would be included but of course is not expectable for this price. But the seller should point that out clearly.\n', ""\n  This could be the best invention ever. We got next day delivery because my son could not wait. We also got the battery pack to charge the backpack. My sons a teenager so he comes home everyday with a dead phone. Not with this backpack. He fit all of his stuff in there with room to spare. The headphone jack, the phone charger and the locking zippers work perfectly. We could not be happier with this backpack. It's worth every penny. I would recommend this to anyone with teenagers, college kids and to all my nursing friends.\n"", ""\n  I was looking for a daypack that I can use for our cruise to the coastal countries of Western Europe and based on the reviews I chose the Tzowla. It weighs less than 1kg and can easily hold all of my electronic toys for our trip and  day excursions.  I really liked that the main compartment can be locked and that it has a luggage strap to prevent it from flopping around as you are making your way through the airport.  The water bottle holder on the outside is very convenient too.  The inside of the main compartment has a space for your Chromebook or Laptop and what I found really kool, was that it has a space to put my electronics charger and my mobile phone from where they can both be easily connected to the outlets located on the outside of the backpack.This backpack comes with a lifetime warranty and for that reason I gave it 5 stars for durability. It's only water resistant as opposed to waterproof but I don't expect to be doing much walking in a downpour. The zippers are the self-healing type which is a plus. The only things that I would like Tzowla to add to this backpack is to make one of the inside or outside pockets RFID Blocking. It would also be nice to add a strap to connect the padded straps to keep them from possibly sliding on your shoulders but this is a very minor issue.So YES, I would definitely buy this product again.\n"", '\n  Very nice backpack, like how small and compact it is and the option to make it more compact with straps at the sides.

Getting the lock to work was simple using the provided instructions and it does seem quite strong.

This backpack is a shining exception.  It's fantastic.  I'm a writing teacher so I end up dragging a lot of papers and stuff to my classes.  I need a backpack that is generously-sized, well-built, and with plenty of pockets.  I was stunned when I opened the box and popped this incredible backpack out.  Instant love.  It's big, has plenty of pockets and carrying compartments, and just feels like a well-made product.  One of the ways I can tell a good backpack is the padding and also how much strap the manufacturers provide.  A previous backpack (that I'm now decommissioning) has barely enough strap for me and I'm not a large person.  This one comes with plenty of adjustment to spare.  And when you hold this in your hands it feels great - padded, great zippers - like I said - instant love.  I can't speak to the wear factor since I just got it but I will report back if it turns out not to be the dream I'm saying here.

I actually just bought two more...\n"", '\n  The zipper a bit smoother than I\'d like. What I mean by this is that when my backpack has my books in it, and the sipper is closed with both ""zipping devices"" at the top of the bag, it slowly opens. And if you don\'t have the clasps latched on the sides, it will open so much that you WILL dump your books onto the floor.The mesh on the sides isn\'t large enough to hold a 16.9 oz water bottle. Not much larger.There are multiple pockets which is nice. The small one on the top center of the bag holds a wireless mouse and charger for my laptop very well. But the bottom small pocket is just barely useful. It holds a few granola bars.The smallest zip pocket is an assortment of semi-awkward slots. They have no eleasticiy, and I find that what I often put in them falls out.And what is up with the hook on the bottom in the center? I seem to be unable to find a reasonable use lol.Even so. I do like the pack a lot. It fits my thinkpad very well. It\'s two main compartments are well sized and useful. It has some nice zip pockets in the side that are great for pens and pencils. And it is just an overall good size when you\'re on the go.I would recommend it to someone who doesn\'t have to lug more than 2 bigger books and a laptop. Otherwise it gets useless fast, and the risk of it opening while you walk becomes very real. It has happened to me twice :( but if your remember to zip both ""zippers"" to one side you\'ll be fine.\n', '\n  I use this backpack as my daily driver, and so far; so good. It\'s roomy, lightweight, comfortable to keep on for long periods, and isn\'t necessarily ugly. Here\'s a rundown of my thoughts on it:PROS:- Enough compartments for adequate organization- The shoulder pads are quite comfy- The zippered compartments are very secure- The buckles keep water bottles and such secure and the chest buckle helps redistribute a little weight off of the shoulders- The handle feels solid and well-madeCONS:- I feel like the laptop area could have been made a little better. I would have preferred the sleeve to have a zipper, or at least have a little thicker padding.- The side buckles prevent the backpack from opening when they are buckled. The bigger brother 17"" Adventure Backpack\xa0\n', ""\n  I bought this backpack for a recent trip with my family and was thrilled with how well it worked! My family I were gone for over two weeks with multiple flights and hotels along the way, and we needed to maximize our carry-on capacity. This backpack definitely holds a good amount of gear, but is also quite comfortable as I hauled it around the airport during layovers and lugged to and from hotels and the car.When I started looking for a backpack to purchase, I read a bunch of reviews, but almost all the top performing bags came in well over the $75 range, which wasn't in my budget. I needed a bag that would have a dedicated pocket for my work laptop, had sufficient storage organization built in for wires and adapters, as well as some small pockets on the outside for easy access to headphones, sunglasses, and charger on the go. This bag had it all! I had also investigated a TSA compliant laptop compartment, as that always makes going through security a little easier, but felt that it wasn't really helpful with this style backpack (just as much effort to pull out my laptop in a sleeve than to unzip half the bag away).My only reason for not going a full 5 stars is I do have a small tear on one of the seams on the top of the bag, revealing that the build quality could be better, but somewhat expected with a bag at this price point.Otherwise, a really fantastic backpack for the price!\n"", '\n  La mochila es de muy buenos materiales, no se siente chafa como algunas que he comprado en tiendas grandes y por el precio está muy bien.

De no ser así, cambiaré mi reseña :) Por ahora muy contento con la compra.\n', '\n  Sto usando, anche se da poco, questo zaino quotidianamente e sembra davvero buono. E \'spazioso, leggero, comodo da tenere per lunghi periodi, ed anche esteticamente, almeno a mio parere, risulta molto gradevole. Non si tratta ovviamente, anche per il materiale, di un prodotto moda, ma di uno zaino che può tranquillamente essere utilizzato per lavoro. Cosa ne penso schematicamente:PRO:- Scomparti sufficienti ed adeguati per l\'organizzazione di pc, cavi, vari documenti/libri/pratiche, accessori personali e zozzerie varie che ci portiamo un po\' tutti dietro- Le spalline sono piuttosto comode- Gli scomparti con zip sono molti e dislocati in vari punti, ne ho contati almeno 7, di cui uno all\'interno della parte centrale- Presenza di fibbie laterali per sicurezza e che aiutano a tenere meglio bottiglie d\'acqua e/ombrelli nelle tasche elastiche laterali, inoltre la fibbia anteriore ad altezza torace aiuta a ridistribuire un po \'di peso fuori delle spalle- La maniglia sembra solida e ben fatta, naturalmente ferma restando la prova del tempo che darà la risposta definitiva a riguardo- Sembra davvero RESISTENTISSIMO e sembra avere una certa impermeabilità (che non ho avuto occasione di testare, però)CONTRO:- l\'area davanti sul basso con la zip a mezzaluna avrebbe potuto essere fatta un po \'meglio. Avrei preferito che fosse un po\' più alta e che ci fossero due zip.- Le fibbie laterali impediscono l\'apertura completa dello zaino quando sono strette. Il fratello maggiore da 17 "" AmazonBasics - Zaino Adventure per computer portatile da 17"" massimo,  non ha questo problema perchè le tasche e le fibbie sono distribuite diversamente. Volendo pensare in maniera ottimistica, forse aiutano un po\' la sicurezza in questo modo.ALTRI PENSIERI:- il mio 15.6  entra perfettamente nella borsa, le sue misure sono 38x25 circa. Metto una foto di modo da aiutare chi abbia notebook di diversa grandezza a regolarsi rispetto al mio.Alla fine della fiera, questo zaino mi piace moltissimo. Ne ho avuto uno più grande per un po\' (victoriatourist V6018, si trova su Amazon) e ad essere onesti, è abbastanza più ingombrante rispetto a questo qui. Per le mie esigenze, invece, trovo che questo abbia la dimensione perfetta.Per quanto mi riguarda, consigliatissimo, insomma, anche per il prezzo davvero accessibile in rapporto alla qualità!! :DSpero che questa recensione possa risultare utile! :)\n', '\n  Ich habe mir den Rucksack gekauft, da ich Handtaschen im Alltag nicht besonders mag und generell etwas eigen bin. Ich mag es gern, wenn ich einfach einen Rucksack habe, in dem alles wichtige drin ist, alles seinen Platz hat und der für jede Gelegenheit einfach mitkommen kann, egal ob Uni, Wochenendbesuche bei der Familie oder Ausflüge..Als ich diesen Rucksack gesehen habe, war ich sofort angetan und bin es auch nach eineinhalb Jahren immer noch. Der Rucksack bietet sehr viele Fächer. Außen sind es drei, ich habe dort jeweils für sich Schlüsselbund, Geldbeutel (ich habe einen ziemlich großen Frauengeldbeutel) und mein Smartphone (auch größere Exemplare finden super Platz). Seitlich gibt es zwei Netze, ideal für Wasserflasche oder auch einen kleinen Regenschirm. Zusätzlich gibt es seitlich so Riemen mit denen man die Reißverschlüsse entlasten kann. Die sollte man unbedingt einsetzen. Ich habe die ganz am Anfang mal aufgemacht und vergessen, da ist mir auf der Straße auf einmal der Rucksack aufgegangen und Zeug rausgefallen. Das war nicht so cool. Seit ich die aber immer zu lasse, ist das nicht mehr vorkommen.Oben hat der Rucksack einen gepolsterten Griff, was besonders für längeres Tragen Gold wert ist. Die Träger für den Rücken sind leicht gepolstert, der Rückenteil etwas mehr. Der Rucksack ist damit sehr angenehm zu tragen. Innen haben wir zwei Fächer. Vorne gibt es ein Netz mit Reißverschluss, wo man sehr viel Kleinzeug lagern kann und sehr einfach überblicken kann. Gegenüber gibt es dann noch ein Fach in das weitere Sachen gesteckt werden können. Das größere Fach ist hinten, also Richtung Rücken. Dort gibt es wieder ein normales Fach, in dem man Gegenstände unterbringen kann. An der Rückseite, also direkt zum eigenen Rücken hin ist dann das versprochene Laptopfach. Es ist gepolstert, kann mit einem Riemen mit Klettverschluss verschlossen werden und bietet auch recht großen Laptops Platz.Der Rucksack ist mein fast täglicher Begleiter, wurde fürs Wochenende schon randvoll gestopft oder ist beim Einkaufen auf dem Rad dabei. Das hat er alles klaglos ertragen. Regen hat er bisher immer sehr zuverlässig abgewiesen, ich hätte bisher keine Probleme mit nassen Sachen im Rucksack.Optisch finde ich ihn auch ganz okay. Ich meine klar, gerade als Frau wäre eine Handtasche vielleicht schicker, aber er ist sehr schlicht und vor allem praktisch. Ich kann mich nicht beschweren.Ich kann ihn sehr empfehlen. Gerade seine Robustheit, seine Schlichtheit und die unheimlich vielen Fächer sind sehr toll.Update: Auch nach zwei Jahren ist der Rucksack noch fast täglich für mich im Einsatz. Er sieht immer noch gut aus, keine abgewetzten Stellen oder ähnliches. Die Gurte und Riemen sind immer noch einwandfrei und sitzen immer noch bequem, nichts abgerissen. Ich bin immer noch sehr zufrieden, gerade durch die vielen Fächer gelingt es den Überblick zu behalten und Ordnung zu halten. Der Rucksack ist wirklich robust. Ich verwende ihn unter der Woche für die Uni und am Wochenende um wegzufahren. Unter der Woche ist er so manches Mal auf dem Rad dabei oder war mit Einkäufen vollgestopft, am Wochenende dient er auch als sehr gefrässiges Lasttier. Bis heue macht er das ohne zu Meckern mit. Absolut zufrieden\n', '\n  Anbei ein Vergleichsfoto des Adventure (links im Bild) und Explorer (rechts im Bild).Adventure: 17"" Notebooks bis 43cm, Maße: 31,8 x 20,6 x 48,8 cmExplorer: 15"" Notebooks bis 38cm, Maße: 49,8 x 31,8 x 20,6 cm (hier liegt wohl ein Fehler vor, der Explorer ist etwa 5cm weniger hoch als der Adventure bzw. generell kleiner)Auch farblich sind sie real sehr ähnlich. Das sieht auf den Produktfotos ganz anders aus.Einen Stern Abzug für die schlechte Produktbeschreibung.\n', '\n  Pathetic material.Poor Quality. Significantly Over priced... Please do not sell such product which I can get in INR 1000 in the market. Felt cheated. Plus please disclose the country of manufacture of all your product for user to make choice.\n']"
