This is very good because any lose in-ear buds will lose not only volume, but the bass quality of a song.• Very plain looking. No branding as they look like just any regular earbuds. Big fan of this because; One, less likely to get stolen, and two, they’re discrete looking. I’m not a fan of being a walking billboard on tech that I already paid money for. This is why I respect that Amazon isn’t following that system with these buds (except for the case, but nobody is perfect).• If you’re indoors, these little guys are just the same as if you have an Amazon Echo in your ear. You don’t need to press anything but just say “Alexa,” and Alexa will be ready to go.• It didn’t take long for me to go get used to the touch controllers. Amazon also went a step further to allow you to customize the function of them. (I just stuck to what was already programmed because the layout they provided is very easy to master.)• No issues when I got sweaty while I was running with them. As Amazon requests, you need to clean them after you take them off. I just used my shirt and it was fine, nothing fancy.• The earbuds know when you take them out of your ear and will pause your music the moment it leaves your ear. I try to trick this feature, but the earbuds weren’t fooled. You can restart your music either asking Alexa or just tap the earbud.• The sound is good but not Air Pods or Bose level. The sound isn’t bloated, has decent bass, and overall has decent balance tones. The best music for this is in the middle that doesn’t rely on a strong bass or deeper sound levels (will explain more later on).• I did hear a decent amount of reduction of sound thanks to Amazon's/Bose's noise-reduction software. Note, this isn't a noise-canceling but it blocks out smaller sounds like the humming sound when your refrigerator turns on, or the sound of cars going by if you’re inside. These types of small sounds are blocked by this software and it does a decent job.• You can use one earbud independently. I found this feature the best when you’re driving. Taking phone calls and even asking directions by using Alexa is definitely a useful tool to use when driving.• If you have an Amazon Echo at home, these earbuds will allow you to make an audio call right to the Echo. Tested this out and it works fine. The response and the receiving end didn’t have any issues. I believe you can also do this feature with any of your friends who have an Echo, but I have to assume they’re some restrictors so you don’t call them in the middle of the night.• With three built-in microphones in each earbud, I felt the call quality to be excellent.• Amazon has added a “sidetone” feature which allows you to hear your voice inside the earbuds. I believe with this you can modulate your voice so Alexa can be able to recognize your voice better when you’re in a loud environment. It’s an interesting tool to have, but you need the app for this.• A built-in quick charge feature on the case will allow the battery to gain a 50% increase in battery life around 20 minutes. What I like about the battery layout specifically is it will show you when you have a lot (green light), an all right (yellow light), or a poor battery life (red light). You can also just check the app, or ask Alexa, but this way is quicker to know right away.• The wingtips that come with these earbuds are useful if you want to feel a little more comfortable that your buds won’t fall out. Even with the soft silicone cover, I honestly didn’t feel the need to wear them as the earbuds stick pretty well in your ear (or at least in my ear). This will probably be different for you, given different ear sizes.• Amazon makes the earbuds visually identifiable for which ear it goes in to. A small feature but very useful in any day to day lifestyle.• The case is small enough to put it in your pocket, with your phone.• You can still use Siri if you want as well as Apple Music and Spotify.• I have an iPhone and so far there have been no disconnections between the earbuds and the phone.Cons and Oks:__________• Micro USB instead of USB-C for charging. Amazon is not letting this go and I have no idea why.• I had no issue with my fit, but they're pretty bulky for earbud size. Depending on your ear size, some may find the fit uncomfortable. My advice is to read what others have to say to get an accurate level. As stated they fit me fine, but I will update you if it changes.• Alexa will not work in loud environments. Just walking on the streets, with average traffic noises, Alexa wasn’t able to hear my voice. I had to put a lot of effort into getting Alexa to work when facing the outside world. Inside is fine but for loud areas, be warned.• No volume controls on the buds. You have to either ask Alexa or use the app. If you’re in a loud environment Alexa will not be helpful, as they basically become wired headphones (without the wire).• As I mention before, these are not “noise-canceling” but just reduces the noises around you. From my experience, this feature will not help you when you’re on a plane. It’s still an upgrade from not having anything, but it will not block all medium/loud sounds.• No wireless charging for the case. You’re stuck with Micro USB.• Without connected to your phone, and no Wi-Fi, Alexa will not work. I wish they created an offline Alexa so simple tasks such as increasing the volume can be performed. You can’t use any features without Wi-Fi.• I notice the case scratches the same day I got it. In your pocket with your keys, this case will show the scratches.• Battery life isn’t great. Around 4.30 hours of use before charging them back in the case. It’s cool that there is a quick charge on the case, but if you forget to charge the case then you’re pretty limited with time. This battery life isn’t horrible, but it sure isn’t great enough to be a pro.• Remember, as with any Alexa, Amazon may potentially review your Alexa voice recording. This is why Alexa needs to be connected online to be used. All interactions go to the cloud because, like the Echo, Alexa is always listening. You can manually delete your Alexa interactions, but that itself is going to be time-consuming, and most of us will forget to keep doing that.• If you disable Alexa then you’re restricted to just basic Bluetooth headphones.• When you adjust the volume, with having the noise reduction active, the music changes in the tune. It only happens for a couple of seconds, but I notice it enough to make a note and see if anyone else has the same issue. Note, it does go away quickly.• It took me a couple of tries to connect it with my iPhone. I had to manually pair them first on the iPhone before using the Alexa app.• You can customize the action touch layout of the earbuds, but you’re very limited in customization.• You also need to install the Alexa app if you want to use these earbuds fully. Amazon is pretty strict about the environment you need to be in.• I’m not a fan of the volume. At a low volume level, the quality of any sound becomes muddy while at high levels weren’t impressive at all. They’re still respected headphones, but I wish the volume levels performed better in the hardware.• Make sure you place the earbuds properly in the case. A couple of times the charging contacts didn’t sit properly against the case.• The phone calls are very clear with your voice but I could still hear background noises when I gave the earbuds to a friend. He was in a room with a football game on TV, at a reasonable volume level.• Around 5-6 mandatory agreements, you need to agree to if you want to use Alexa or configure with Amazon’s Alexa’s app.Bottom Line:__________Amazon always tries to find the middle ground in the quality of a product and the price you’re paying. To summarize, these earbuds fit without any wobble, all of Alexa is right in your ear, the noise reduction software does its job well, and it has a great microphone setup. I respect that there are no logos on the buds themselves and to be able to have a case to keep your earbuds charged on the go is right on point.But to compete with Apple or Samsung, sadly I don’t think so. You have to allow Alexa to be on all the time, which reduces an already weak battery system. And if you disable Alexa then most features are limited, such as not being able to increase/decrease the volume (you will have to go on your phone)/ Also, I’m not a fan of the battery life and of course Micro USB (Amazon, please kill this) is still there, which means no wireless charging.To be honest I felt these earbuds could be worth a little less than what they're asking. Still good earbuds, but I felt the sound isn’t anything to brag about. If you don’t want to afford the pricing of Apple, Google, or Bose earbuds, and you hate the reviews of Samsung earbuds, then this is worth it. I will say the best part of Amazon is they always have sale discounts so if these hit the $99 range you better pick them up. Just be aware you must enjoy the earbuds with the use of Alexa. If you don’t want that, then these are not worth the price.Overall: Not the best in overall quality but the best in establishing Amazon’s Echo in earbud form.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer\n"", '\n  I\'m a tech early adopter. I\'m used to things being a little janky but functional. That describes the original v1 Kindle, but I always felt like the product was working. Like I was getting the intended experience from it. These things are not ready for wide release. Every time I interact with them, they\'re misbehaving in a different way. Why does the case light only blink red, no matter the charge? Why does one bud or the other (it\'s random!) lose charge more quickly during each use? Why is it that sometimes I have to remove the buds from my phone\'s Alexa app, then go through re-pairing? Why don\'t double taps work more than half the time? Why is ""press and hold"" sometimes instant and sometimes takes up to three seconds? Why do I sometimes hear the whispers of long dead relatives come from the ear buds? Mom? Is that you? AND WHY do these echo buds start to feel heavy the longer you wear them? How does that work? I don\'t know! It\'s a mystery!\n', ""\n  I was so excited to get these. Alexa in my ears? Sounds convenient! These could not be more disappointing. Amazon should have spent a considerable amount of time polishing out the bugs in these ear buds before releasing them. The number of issues I have with them is just unreasonable. They don't charge evenly in the case. Left bud will be at 18%, right at 99%. Obviously poor charger connections in the case. The sound is PATHETIC. These things are so quiet it's a joke. I have $20 Bluetooth headphones that make these sound like tin cans. I can hold a regular conversation at max volume while using these buds and that is unacceptable considering they're supposed to be noise canceling. Ha. The only way to control volume on these is by turning up your phone media volume and/or asking Alexa to turn the volume up. No volume controls in the Alexa app like they have for other sound devices. And the noise canceling?? Doesn't work at all. Passthrough? Basically just amplifies all outside noise so you feel like you're wearing hearing aids instead of headphones. The buds do not fit properly. They do not offer large enough tips. Period. I'm a 5 ft tall petite female and these things fall right out of my head with largest tips and wings in. Within 20 minutes of having them in my ears hurt so much I can't even keep them in my ears anymore. Pretty sure the smaller tips are made for children. The touch gestures are idiotic. You try to grab the bud falling out of your ear and it thinks you're using the touch gestures, but when you're actually trying to use the touch gestures the buds ignore your touch. Like they're laughing in your face. Can't share a bud with someone... If each person has a bud it won't play music in one bud even if you're standing right next to each other. Multiple times they have just flat out stopped playing a song right in the middle of it for no reason. One of the most annoying problems??? These buds do not function in tandem with any other Amazon devices which is beyond asinine. Please do yourself a favor and do not waste money on these pieces of trash. I have nothing positive to say about them at all. I'm returning these overpriced pieces of junk.\n"", '\n  In theory these should be great, but they are not.As Earbuds go they sound pretty good and are pretty comfortable, but the way they work is not good.  The issues I keep having are:1.  They say connected to BT but will not work, or the audio side does not connect.2.  The BT connection keeps dropping audio which is very annoying and beats the point of having these.3.  The Buttons (touch) are most often un responsive, or select the wrong thing.4.  When you ask for Alexa, you have to pause until she responds before you can tell her what to do.5.  The graphic equalizer does not respond to what it should. (I wanted to have less bass, but it did not change.)6.  They also make a static like click when they engage sound for some reason.This reminds me of getting the Echo Auto.  Nice idea, but at first was rushed out to people before all the bugs were ironed out.\n']"

(I do own more expensive headphones and earbuds but sometimes it's good to have a few cheap options available in case something gets damaged or lost etc.) For the price, these are a good choice. Are there better sounding more durable earbuds out there? Yes, of course there are! That being said, you can have three or four sets of these, or, one pair that are more expensive... They paired with my iPhone XR without a problem. The charging case works fine, they sound fine for music and Netflix so far, and the fit is acceptable. Again, please remember the pricepoint here... I am not a fan of making/recieving phone calls using earbuds because it seems like the other person has trouble hearing me a lot of the time. So as far as that feature is concerned, I can't comment on it yet as I just don't use it. How long will they last? I have no idea. If things go downhill, I'll update my review.\n"", '\n  \xa0Great product, came quickly sounds is definitely loud enough for me! earbuds no buttons touch sensitive cool charging case.\n', '\n  So my wife took her headphones for a walk and got stuck in the pouring rain! Low and behold, she gets back from the walk and they are completely dead. I went on Amazon and found these earbuds that have the look of the Apple AirPod pros, and thought I’d give it a shot.Product arrived today and played around with it.In the box came the charging case (with earbuds inside), charging cable, other earbud sizes, quick start instructions, full manual, and 24 month warranty card (which was longer than I thought it was).The charging case has a magnetic top, so it doesn’t open up by accident. The two earbuds are also magnetically held in the case, which is great. Just get close to putting it in the case, and the magnets pull it right in.They easily connected to the iPhone and sounds great. The battery seems to last a long time, and the case will charge the earbuds 7 times before having to charge the case, which is phenomenal.Easy controls on them.. just tap on it and pause the music. A call comes in, tap on either earbud and answer the call. Tap again and hang up. Sound on the phone is great, as if you’re talking on the actual phone.I would recommend these headphone for anyone that’s looking for a less expensive alternative than Apple, and/or want a long warranty period.\n', ""\n  This is a Great wireless headset for the price! What I like about this product is that it comes in a cute small black charging case. Just plug it in and it charges the headset. The rubberized earbuds make it comfortable and easy to put in your ears and feel secure that they won't fall out. I love that the product comes with an additional pair of rubberized earbuds in case you lose one or need a different size. The sound quality is wonderful and it synchronizes with your phone within seconds. I purchased this for my son for Christmas and now my daughter wants one after trying it out! This is a great buy!!!!!\n"", ""\n  I have been in need of a new pair of bluetooth earbuds for a while. I was pleasantly surprised to find this affordable pair by Aukey.I also have Aukey charging cables and Aukey bluetooth transmitter for my car that I bought months ago. I find their products to be extremely high quality for such an affordable price. I've become a fan of this brand over the last few months!I had a feeling these bluetooth earbuds would be excellent for my needs, but I'm really impressed by the quality. They fit very well, sound is excellent, charging/carrying case is perfectly compact, and battery life is better than expected.I was able to use the bathroom at work today and I didn't have to pause my podcast... I was able to keep listening with these earbuds about 20 feet away from my device. Silly, but pretty cool.I HIGHLY recommend these earbuds! I like them so much thinking about getting a 2nd pair. One for home & one to keep at work.\n"", ""\n  I was not expecting much from these little guys. First off they came in a plain cardboard and felt way too light. Packaging was tight. But good. The case came out easy. Instructions at the bottom. Ear tips and USB cable.The case is small, thin, and extremely light. The case feels flimsy but not too bad. Case latches nicely and doesn't fly open easily.  Wish it was USB C but can't complain for the price.The buds are super light. Has indicator lights for syncing, when connected and when low power. The tips fit nicely. I was lucky to get a good seal with the stock pair of tips. The buds are light so it doesn't drag on your ears. They're a bit thicker than airpods but lighter. The fit is better with the orientation a bit more forward than hanging straight down like airpods. They are comfortable and don't hurt my ears after a couple hours. They work independently of each other. It does make a weird pause and beep when connecting separately though.This is where I was floored. The sound is really big for the price. These sound really good. The volume is great  not the loudest but good volume. The only thing they lack is clarity in the mids. It's not muddy but just not all there. The bass is sufficient, pretty much airpods level. The highs are very crisp. These may be a tad high heavy but everything sounds amazing for this price. Amazing!Because these are airpods style with the mic hanging down call quality is pretty decent. Not airpods good but decent.The touchpads work great! And battery life is decent. Lasted me about 3 hours on a charge.For the price, these are great. No brainier if you don't mind the airpods style. The toothbrush hanging from your ears. I don't mind and will be using these often.\n"", ""\n  I've bought a lot of wireless earbuds trying to find the ones that are right for me and these are easily in the top 10% in terms of audio quality and fidelity. There's a ok amount of bass but mids and highs are perfect. The fact that these use the APT-X codec is probably a factor in why these sound so good.these are using a Qualcomm technology called TWS Plus as opposed to the standard TWS. The previous generation of ear buds I bought relied on one bud to act as master and the 2nd bud to be slave. This TWS Plus generation equally distributes the processing to both buds and greatly increases battery life and signal strength. I have had no cut outs or signal issues with these buds.As is pretty standard, they came with several sets of the ear pieces, and I was able to easily find one that fit my ears. They are comfortable, and work great for music, videos and calls.\n"", ""\n  I'm really impressed with the sound quality of these buds. The bass is amazing without being too invasive and blurring the audio in your ear so that's a huge plus for me. These are super comfortable in the ear, they feel light and smooth and it even comes with the various ear-tips so you change sizes if needed. They have touch controls i.e. double tap to play/pause (this is perfect because my previous  pair would play/pause or hang up calls when all I wanted to do was adjust them in my ear - I couldn't do that without turning off my song or hanging up calls by mistake which was annoying - I won;t have that problem now!). The instructions are very clear so there shouldn't be any problem figuring out the touch controls in case you're worried about it! These can also be paired individually so you're not forced to have both on at the same time (I like to alternate sometimes so I can hear what's going on around me). Even with one in the sound isn't unbalanced so another positive. Would 100% recommend buying these.\n"", ""\n  1. Excellent fit - lightweight and comfortable, sturdy and remains solidly in the ear even when you're moving around.2. Big range of earbud adaptors provided with the headphones.3. Sound quality is amazing for such a small device - great all round sound, excellent for both watching films and listening to music. Volume is good enough to cover background noise such as public transport. Bass is very impressive in such a small unit!4. Ability to control by tap touch means you don't have to get your phone out of your pocket and have a wide range of control options.5. Simple, easy to follow quick start instructions and a good user manual detailing the various touch options.6. Incredibly quick and reliable Bluetooth pairing - fastest I've seen.I honestly can't really fault the product, it's a massive upgrade to the bluetooth headphones I had previously.Very impressed with these, I did not expect them to be such good value for the price.\n"", '\n  These Aukey wireless earphones are perfect. I have been working from home for some time and fed up with wearing a headset. I was unable to pair my well-known headphones to my work laptop and getting frustrated. I found these and very glad I did.They arrived next day in a very compact recyclable package. Unpacked, charged and paired to my laptop in no time. Really simple process. Did the same with my phone and tablet and just as simple and successful each time.The headphones have all the features you would like in a headset, and once I had selected the correct fittings for my ears they fitted perfectly and do not fall out. I have tried eating with them in, running and wrestling with my little boy and they still have not fallen out.Having them work with my business laptop helps enormously, as I am now able to wear them for conference calls and the feedback from meeting attendees is that they can hear me perfectly and I can hear them clearly too ..... and when not in meetings can listen to music from my iPhone too, with the added benefit of being able to answer the phone with them also..... and they work with Siri ......Perfect.If you are looking for quality in-ear headphones, with the features you would expect and at a great price, I would highly recommend these. I am really pleased I bought them. 5 stars from me.\n', '\n  PROS:- Neat sturdy little box which looks nice and is a good size to carry around.- Headphones connect immediately and there\'s no delay.- Sound quality is pretty good for the price, an everyday listener won\'t have any issues with the sound.- Pretty comfortable to wear and don\'t fall out of the ear easily.- Charge stays for a good amount of time and the charging case is really useful.CONS:- Touch is very inconsistent. It\'s may or may not work. Even after finding the right ""spot"", it\'s not reliable. So, if you need your touch to work really well, don\'t have an expectations.- While the earphones don\'t necessarily fall out they can get a bit loose if you\'re yawning/chewing. Maybe it\'s because the earbud isn\'t perfect for my ear but just thought I\'d mention it.- It sometimes has connectivity issues with my MacBook (a slight delay) but connects immediately with an Android.Overall for the price it\'s a good buy and would recommend if you don\'t have high expectations :)\n']"

No matter how hard I try, they fall out of my ear in less than a minute. I thought I would try a different brand, and when I put these in my ear, they fell out within seconds. I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I’m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!The quality of sound is impeccable, nice highs and lows, with a decent amount of bass. Once I found the right match, the fit was extremely comfortable.I love these headphones, they have already changed my life for the better!\n"", ""\n  I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.\n"", '\n  Connected these to my fire stick, which is why I purchased it so I can watch tv while my husband is sleeping. The volume on the ToZo was extremely loud. I wasn’t able to adjust it not even with the tv or fire stick remote. The volume can only be controlled when connected to your phone or tablet. I bought this on Prime Day thinking I was getting a good deal and Paid $49.99 with $3 off but found out other purchase this for around $25/$30. Two stars because they work find when connected to a phone or table but that’s not what I purchased them for.UPDATE REVIEW...This is an update. TOZO Customer service is wonderful they reached out to me to rectify the issue. They issued another TOZO Bluetooth. The previous one works great with my devices just not with my smart tv. Haven’t tried the new one yet but Will keep you posted.  Thanks TOZO\n', ""\n  Every Christmas I usually have enough personal money to make an impulse purchase, usually in Electronics. This year, I wanted to upgrade the $20 pair of totally wireless sound (TWS) earbuds I had. They were good, but needed better sound to make them perfect.With a budget of about $100, I started off looking for something good from a known manufacturer (like Samsung, Jabra, etc.) There was just nothing out there in my price range. I couldn't see myself paying that kind of money from a brand I didn't know, so I started looking for a cheaper model. For around $50 I found 3-4 that looked good and reviews were good enough. I liked Anker's other Bluetooth earphones, so the Soundcore Liberty Lites were considered. With the good reviews and previous good ownership of Monoprice products the Monoprice IPX4s were looking good, too.Due diligence and a desire to be able to use one earbud at a time drive me to search Amazon's best rated under $50 TWS sets, and Tozo looked pretty good. While the buds are labeled L and R, they are both the same, and can be put into either ear. They come with 4 tips, and for the first time, I'm not using the largest ones. So if you have really big ear canals and find it hard to get tips that fit, you may find a good fit here.The sound won't knock Bose out of the water, but for the forty dollars I paid, it is good, and an outstanding upgrade from my $20 pair. It has nice bass, and well defined mids and highs.Battery time is right around 4 hours at low volume (I wear them at work as background noise). The travel case can charge one while the other is playing, so I don't find it hard to get through a work day with them. I like the charging case, too. It's well built, and can use a Qi wireless charger, which I don't care about really. There are 4 lights to tell you how charged it is. it closes and fits in a pocket. I can't tell you how many charges it will take, because I usually keep it plugged in.Pairing, once initially done, is easy. Just pull a bud off the charger and it will turn on and start looking for your paired device. Since I'm using one at a time, I find I need to turn the one I'm using off completely first, then get the other one. I paired them first together, and then separate. This is the best part of these for me, almost seamless use.All in all, very happy with the purchase. And I save up some money to get something else. I have already recommended these to people (my brother is not convinced, he has bone conducting headphones he likes). I do like them that much.\n"", ""\n  \xa0I upgraded from Tozo T8 to the T10 and also own a pair of wireless earbuds from a well known Brand associated with fruit, and have to say I am very impressed with the TOZO T10 in comparison to the other that I own.First of all, They are great value. The set up was very straight forward and connected to my devices bluetooth in a few seconds. When you pick the earbuds up out of the case they automatically attach to each other and have useful light indicators. The case also has light indicators to show the charge level which is very helpful.The waterproof feature is very useful as I'm often worried about headphones if it is raining etc.They fit in my ear nicely and don't fall out as there is a selection of attachment earpiece sizes to best fit the size of your ear.Nice presentation in the box and good clear instructions.The sound is really nice, I have listened to a selection of songs and audiobooks etc and the sound is up there with some of the best sounding earbuds I've used, very clear with good sound range / overall levels and I'd definitely recommend them!The sound range distance is good, I walked downstairs in my home and continued to listen to the headphones no problem (under 10 metres).The case and earbuds feel very premium, there is even a lanyard included for carrying around your neck or hanging on a hook etc.For the price you can't go wrong, also supports wireless charging which I might have to try out as well!I've added an unboxing video plus some photos to help show what's included too.Thanks for reading my review and hopefully this might've helped in your decision to try out these brilliant headphones if you do decide to get these. Happy listening!\n"", ""\n  So I bought these headphones for a single purpose - use in the hot tub (I already use AirPods for running/exercise and some noise-cancelling Bose headphones for when I'm at work)... I have to admit they were a bit of a shot-in-the-dark and I honestly wasn't expecting much from them, especially as I used to have some cheaper headphones for running that were terrible, and really put me off the 'budget' price point.Now these are clearly not AirPod or Bose standard, but frankly for the price they sound excellent. Crystal clear treble and more than enough low-end for me... using my go to track (Wilderness from Clannad's Anam) they have good definition and far exceeded my expectations.They are much larger than AirPods, and you MUST ensure they are correctly positioned (with the right-sized rubber ends on) or the sound quality drops dramatically - but after a few minutes of getting this right (as a one off) they more than meet the requirements. The size isn't really a hinderance to them, because it lets them sit in the ears quite comfortably - but your mileage might vary (with ear size).I haven't had them long enough to gauge battery life, but the wireless charging feature of the case works fine from my standard charging mat.So the TL;DR... really good value for money and surprisingly high sound quality - Recommend!(For full disclosure they cost £29.99 when I bought them and TOZO have offered me an extra wireless charger, no strings attached - but the later has not influenced my review, other than encouraging me to write it).\n"", ""\n  I bought these to take on holiday to Spain, I intended lots of beach and poolside music listening and didn't fancy the wires or bulkiness of my existing headphones. In ear and wire free was a must and having compared many of the headphones on Amazon I ended up choosing these.I wasn't expecting much for the price paid, but first impressions were very positive. The packaging is excellent and suggests premium quality. The charging case is much sturdier than I imagined and the earbuds themselves smaller than I imagined (in a good way).I used the earbuds and charging case daily whilst on holiday for anything from 1-5 hours at a time without any issue. The sound quality is surprisingly very good, a much better bass than I was expecting. Everything seemed nice and clear. I never intended to keep using them daily on my return from holiday, but I have. They are fine when walking too, I expected them to fall out but they don't. I'm not sure I'd trust running in them though.The jury is still out on the long term longevity and battery life a few months down the line, but I'll be happy to revisit this review and update it in a few months if my opinion changes.\n"", '\n  The sound cancellation is really amazing, I couldn’t hear anything else but my music.The quality is good in itself, I had another pair of wireless earphones and it made me unsure if I should buy another pair as the sound quality want good, but these are amazing.They’re easy to use and connected to my phone within seconds, overall really love these\n', '\n  \xa0I have to say these ear buds are great quality both made and for comfort worked straight out of the box and you can even carge the box with a QI wireless charging pad or through the cable it has different size ear buds for comfort and ive included a small video but if your thinking of buying some then just spend a little bit more and buy these because the sound quality is great\n']"

I am a professional musician by trade and these have incredibly clear sound quality, really high end parts put into this product.The connection is fast and easy, it charges while in the case which is a great feature but better than all these features I love the ability to wear them in the shower and jam to tunes while they get soaked and survive it like a champ. Really high end headphones for a amazingly good price. I would recommend these to anyone looking for Bluetooth headsets similar to those made by Apple but for a far less price and also BETTER bass response!!The touch controls on the side are fantastically good if you wanted to pause music or youtube at work when someone asks you a question so you can hear them without taking the headset out. They are incredibly good at isolating and even at the lowest volume they can shut out the world around you. I wear them everywhere and love them so much.They come with a charge case, 3 extra sets of ear tips to fit whatever size ear you have, a charge cable for charging the case (micro usb) and a one year warrantee!Do yourself a favor and get a set of these superb Bluetooth earbuds!Did I mention they are waterproof?! IPX8 Waterproof!!\n', ""\n  This is the second time I reviewed this company's products. I'm sort of a earbud Junkie, and make a lot of purchases. About six months ago I purchased the older version of these headphones, and fell in love. I was looking on Amazon to see what other products this company had, and if there was any new versions. I was pleasantly surprised to see be upgraded version of headphones so I found a reason to order the newest set by giving my children my old set. I work in construction and listen to audio books all day long keep from going crazy , my job is incredibly boring. Because my job keeps me from home for such a longperiod. I only use one earbud at a time. I insert the first one around 3 a.m. and begin my stories, I swap it out around lunch and the second one last me until 4:30 in the afternoon when I get home. In the past with other brands I've had I'd have to swap out my earbuds about every 2 hours, not with these. The newest version that I'm reviewing is even better than the last, both in battery power, insound, an ability to connect to my phone. One problem that I've noticed I've had in the past with the charging boxes is that the magnets are almost never strong enough to keep the earbud from falling off while charging, this newest version has an incredibly strong making. It doesn't help that I have fat fingers then make it difficult for me to grasp small things. Hahaha, they did a great job we're including super strong magnets they will ensure that these earbuds keep charging for the next use. I threw my phone in one of my back pockets of my pants and this new version ensures you don't lose connection no matter which way you turn your head. They're incredibly loud and clear so that when you're in a noisy environment you can still hear what you're listening to. It took me a moment to get use to the fact that the buttons are touch activated rather than traditional buttons, but I quickly became acustomed to brushing the face of the earphone. Its nice as now when I set them in my ear I dont knock them out when trying to pause my audiobooks when people are trying to talk to me. In my last review of this company's products I said they have a customer for life, and I gladly say it again.\n"", '\n  Update: After about a year of use, we ran into some trouble with these headphones. They are constantly disconnecting from bluetooth and one of the earbuds is super quiet. I messaged Tozo to inquire about the warranty, and they are sending a full replacement. Two thumbs up for their customer service!I have a young teenage son who wanted a pair of AirPods, as he was sick of headphones with wires. I was unwilling to get him something so expensive, so we compromised with these, as it won’t be as big of a deal if he loses them!I already own and love a pair of Tozo T-10s, but he wanted a pair with a much smaller case that will fit in his pocket at school. These fit the bill! They’re about 1/4 inch wider and just slightly taller than airpods. He’s super happy with the size.The lid is magnetic and closes with an audible clack just like AirPods. Apparently my teen thinks this is important, ha ha.Charging via a charging pad works great. My son really likes the four bright lights that tell him how much charge is left. He says he’s used them all week and hasn’t had to recharge his case yet.The sound seems good. My son has no complaints whatsoever. I borrowed them for a few hours to listen to podcasts, and the sound was good for that.One thing that I wish was like the T-10 is that it does not appear that you can pair one earbud to one device, and the other earbud to another device.  My phone just recognizes these as Tozo-T6. The T-10s show as Tozo-T10-R (or L), which allows me to pair them as two separate devices. I wish this had that. But my son could care less, as he doesn’t own more than one device. :)Overall, my son loves these and is totally happy to have these and not AirPods. The model number suggests that maybe it’s a lower mode number than the T-10, but I think these actually might be a newer, upgraded version.\n', '\n  \xa0I have been using this earbuds for sometime now and these are perfect!. I was able to use this for long hours without getting ear pain. Sound quality is absolutely amazing and its very easy to carry in your pocket while traveling. I highly recommend this product.\n', ""\n  Let’s face it, if anyone is looking to buy a pair of in ear wireless headphones then opting for the Apple AirPods is where almost all of us would start looking. But with so many other options now on the market is there something that is able to do the job (or even a better job) for a fraction of the cost....we’ll, yes there is!The Tozo T6 headphones are a great option for anyone looking for their first delve into wireless headphone territory.Firstly the form factor is great, they don’t have the annoying stick down the side of the ear unlike Apple AirPods, these are confined to your actual ear, if you wear a scarf it means you won’t dislodge these, and with a true in ear seal, which is made even better with so many ear cup options they fit very snugly without being tight or uncomfortable. the case also mirrors the Apple style with magnets to hold them into place with a handy charge light on the case, the nicely clicking opening hinge further gives joy when opening the up, one minor gripe is that they can be a bit fiddly to get out, but I’ve always managed.Functionality of these is also excellent, you can play, pause, skip, rewind, even turn volume up and down with only the touch to the headphones (something which is way ahead of the apple ones) They even speak back to you what option you’ve selected which is very helpful so you know if it’s understood what you've asked for.Sound quality is excellent for a pair of wireless headphones, especially at the price point. The fact that they seal completely in your ear gives great passive noise cancellation, and although when playing some songs they can be a little soft in the mid and lacking in base, just tweaking Spotify’s EQ to bass boost gives a lovely rich warm sound which is excellent.I can’t comment on battery life as yet, but other users seem impressed, and Tozo Claim 5 hours of music playback, which is far longer than my 1 hour commute so it’s fine for my (and probably most peoples) needs.As seen on the photo they come with micro USB charging case and instructions, but are very easy to set up and pair straight from the box.In summary these are an excellent pair of headphones from a sound, comfort, form factor and the all important, price point. Would definitely recommend them.(And for those wondering, yes I do own a pair of Apple AirPods too...)\n"", '\n  Really nice product. I couldnt justify spending £150+ on apple airpods when these looked so appealing especially the price! The reviews on amazon were all very positive so i thought i would give them a try. I havnt been left disappointed... this product in my eyes is just as good as any other on the market. They fit perfectly and come with alternative ear sizing pieces where you can change them to whatever suits your ear for comfort. Really happy... going to buy another pair for my partner.\n', '\n  I\'ve used wireless earbuds for a while, and I\'m generally a fan of my B&O E8 2.0s. However, I have been shopping around for a while for new earbuds to use as a backup for a few reasons:- The leather case on the B&Os feels premium, but it\'s not exactly practical for the gym- Connectivity on the B&O is not perfect when on the move, especially when your phone is close to your bodyBeing broadly satisfied with TOZO products (love their screen protectors for my Samsung Note 9), I decided to give these wireless earbuds a chance. They came promptly. The box has a real premium feel, and the earbuds are nicely packed inside, with the standard plastic protection you would expect from a premium product. Algotether, the presentation feels more Apple-y than I was expecting (which is a really good thing!).Taking the wrapper off of the case, it\'s very similar in size, shape & design to the Airpod case (which was the obvious inspiration). I was a little disappointed -- but not surprised -- to see a Micro-USB port on the bottom instead of a USB-C port; however, wireless charging works as advertised. The case shape is also nice because it\'s not as thick as the ""losenge"" case of the E8s -- it\'s much easier to slip into a pocket.When you take the buds out of the case for the first time, they immediately drop into pairing mode, and I was paired and running in less than 30 seconds. My phone reports they prefer to stream in AAC, which is kind of what you would expect for buds in this price range.In terms of signal strength and stability of connection, these blow the B&Os completely out of the water. With the B&Os, if I had my phone in the back left pocket, the signal would drop the moment I moved to a noisy environment. With the TOZO pair, the connection stays solid and reliable.In terms of audio quality, I\'m no audiophile but the TOZOs are clearly more bass-heavy than my E8s -- this actually makes them nicer for pop and mainstream music in certain scenarios. I\'ve also taken a few calls on these and my voice has come through without much issue (which is actually an improvement on the E8s, which aren\'t known for their microphone quality).All told, these are good ""starter"" earbuds, and also a good companion for someone who may have a much pricier set which they don\'t want to take to the gym / in the rain. They are excellent value for the price.\n', ""\n  I have been searching for ages for some Bluetooth earphones which are waterproof/sweatproof, have good sound quality and are similar to Airpods in design without the Apple price. Well look no further, these tick all the boxes!They look great and much more expensive than they are. The charging case is perfect and works well to keep them charged up and has LED lights on the front to indicate how much charge it has left. In terms of the headphone design, I was worried that they would fall out all the time, especially as I wanted to use them for running, but with all the different size ear pieces, I found a perfect fit and so far they haven't budged. It takes a little bit of getting used to if you haven't used similar in-ear headphones before but they fit well and are comfortable to wear for a prolonged amount of time. Just make sure to place them in and twist them for a secure fit. The sound is of a really good quality with a good bass and is good at cancelling background noise. The touch function to change and pause songs works smoothly and is simple, with just a slight delay from command to it doing what you've asked. Pairing the device was so simple and once you've paired once it will remember your device. You can turn on/off both earpieces individually so make sure you have turned both on to get the sound in both - you can also used just one ear piece if you would like.These are a really great product, especially for the price! Just be aware they do not come with a charger so I have been on the hunt for a micro-USB cable and will eventually buy their wireless charging pad - another pro of them is that they support wireless charging. Another positive is how quick the delivery was - ordered them Sunday evening and received them by lunchtime Monday.\n"", '\n  -I wanted a bit of time to test these out properly before reviewing so a few weeks later here goes:-Fast delivery and in good quality packaging (not excessive)-I purchased the white headphones, they look and feel great quality for the cost and the colour seems slightly pearlised which I love!-Worked straight out of the box and has an 18month warranty sticker included to register-Sound quality is great - I like quite bass heavy music (RnB, Dancehall, House) as well as classical and some rock so I tested a wide variety of music genres and also films and I am impressed with the quality in comparison to bigger brands used, the bass is just right and all sounds seem crisp and clear and the volume is more than sufficient unless you really want to wreck your eardrums!-Love the wireless charging feature and it’s so fast too, the headphones held a good 4+hrs continuous charge on highest volume for me which I think is excellent-Headphones feel really stable in your ears (several buds to chose from so should fit majority of people well)-Very touch responsive and really easy to operate-Tested falls on them too and whilst I don’t really use them for this often it worked well enough and was clear for me and the other caller-I was able to move around the entire house and into the garden and not lose any sound quality-These are excellent true wireless headphones for the price and I have and would definitely recommend them!\n']"

These earbuds get ⭐🤩⭐⭐ solely for bang for the buck and the quality.  While these aren't airpods or pixel buds, they are still excellent. Here is what I like:- bang for the buck- lightweight-sits nice and solidly in my ear (earbuds hate staying in my right ear, but these stay really well)- touch controls are very intuitive and responsive- great bass- good noise reduction (can still hear what is going on around you, but it's reduced more than regular earbuds)- stay in my ears during workouts (a lot of HIIT calisthenics)- battery life- USB type C so I can use my phone charger to charge the case- can use it to trigger Google Assistant- 2 year warrantyWhat can be improved:- bass is a little heavy. Midranges can sound a little muddy- touch sensitivity can cause accidental actions if you're readjusting the earbudsI already own a pair of MPOW headphones (Flame 2) and had them go bad after about 8 months.  I contacted support.  They were very responsive and shipped out a new pair of headphones to me.  Their service is great!\n"", '\n  The Mpow Mbits are my third Mpow earbud purchase. My family uses their the Mpow M9 & M30 almost daily, primarily for music and watching sports/Netflix on iPad. The Mbits are top quality like the other two we have. They come with a great charging case, charge quickly, and hold the charge for several days/plays.The sound quality is great, I find the M30 to be more noise canceling than the Mbits due to the design. I find the Mbits to be more versatile, the stem design allows me to pop them in/out quickly if I need to during a walk.  The volume feature is great, easy to manipulate up and down with touch. I can listen to music low and still be aware of my surroundings, or turn it up to lose myself in a tune. The touch features are easy to use (each Mpow pair we have work the same, so no confusion going from paint to pair). Mic feature works very well on Mbits, answering a phone call on the go and video chats online work with out a glitch.I take these everywhere and like that they always have a charge and I’m prompted by the battery lights when to plug in for a quick charge!I am very pleased with the Mpow earbuds quality, battery life and sound. The fit is great too, I have small ears and they stay put.\n', '\n  Really happy with these earbuds. My partner gifted them to me since I’ve been looking around for a good pair for a while now. I also have smaller sized ears and like that they came with alternate sized buds to replace the standard size as well. They fit snug and are comfortable in my ear for long periods of time, which has always been an issue for me in the past.The sound is crisp and smooth and the tap features are really responsive. Overall very happy with this!\n', ""\n  Received the MPOW Mbit S's and put them to the test.  I have a pair of the MPOW M9's and also Apple Airpods (original, not Pro).  The Mbit S's are by far the best of the 3 and my new favorite earbuds.  I have always gone back and forth on earbuds with the silicon tip's.  The older Mpow M9's never quite fit right and were a bit too big (see photos).  This is what caused me to switch to Apple Airpods, however, I didn't love the lack of a good seal with the Apple's  The new Mbit S's fit much much better and have a perfect seal for noise cancellation.  Mpow also made the case smaller with the S's and I love that too!Everything about the Mbit S's are better than the M9's.  I'll try to break it down.  First, the fit is excellent.  They provide various silicone tips for different ear types, but it is the entire ear piece that is smaller and more well balanced.  Second, the touch control is far better than the M9's.  Hold touch on right for volume up, left for volume down.  Double tap right for next song, left for repeat last song. Triple tap for siri.  Third, the case size is perfect, not too big and not too small.  The Apple Airpod case always feels like I am going to lose it, but the new Mbis S is just right.  Forth, the sound is excellent.  The bass is good and the treble tones are well balanced.  I think the sound is superior to the Airpod's!!  The noise cancellation is very good...it is not going to be as good as an over the ear headphone and is probably a bit less than the Airpod pro's (I have tried them and the noise cancellation is very nice).  The battery life on the Mbits are excellent and I love the USB C charge on the case.The only thing that is still to determine is longevity.  But at this price point, you could buy these 4 to 5 times before you hit the Apple pricing.  I highly recommend and have already bought some as gifts for friends.\n"", '\n  \xa0I got these wireless headphones to use for watching movies and tv shows with my friends via video chat programs during the pandemic. The sound quality is great! Music, sound effects, and voices are very clear. They are extremely easy to use and pair to your devices. I love the battery life! The case even has a built in battery so when you store them, they charge automatically. They are comfortable to wear as well.One of my favorite features is that audio comes through both earbuds when you use them to make a phone call. Other earbuds do not have this feature. They do an excellent job of noise cancelling as well. I highly recommend these!\n', '\n  I have been using these for a few days. Here are my thoughts.They came charged straight out of the box, which was great. Connecting is frustration-free! Once initially paired, the moment I take the earphones out of the charging unit, its connected to my phone.They feel like good quality. Unlike other wireless earphones I have used in the past, these feel solid. They fit comfortably into the ear and the sound is clear and impressive.You can charge them in the box which comes with a handy indicator showing how much juice is left. When in use, a handy voice informs you that your earphones are running low on battery and need to be charged.Another good thing is they are solid so have a little weight to them. That means, I can feel if I am not wearing one earphone or if one has fallen out (this rarely happens though). Unlike some I have used in the past which are so light, I have to trace my steps to see where it fell out!Overall, I highly recommend these as a solid, well-built wireless earphones with crisp sound and no frustrations.\n', ""\n  As I now own both the Mpow Mbits and M30s I thought I'd do a quick review covering the differences.First thing to say is they are both fantastic so you won't be disappointed whichever ones you go for, however, they are quite different and here's how...Sound - to my ears, the Mbits have a warmer sound with more bass and softer highs. The M30s have a brighter high end, slightly more scooped out mids and more precise sound (still plenty of bass). The Mbits have a more immediate and emersive sound with LOADS of bass.Wearability - the Mbits are loads easier to take out the case, easier to put in and take out of your ears and more comfortable to wear over long periods. However, because of the 'fins', the M30s are more stable and stay in better (they are not going anywhere once they are in! ). Note - If you have tiny ears the Mbits are likely to fit better than the M30s.Battery - I've not been able to test this properly yet as i've only had the Mbits a week, but the battery life is supposed to be much better on the Mbits. I've not had to charge the case at all yet which is a good sign. The 5 lights on the case that indicate level of charge are more intuitive than the single light on the M30s case which changes colour to indicate level of charge.Overall - if you are a bass head and/or you are going to be taking them in and out of your ears or the case a lot, the Mbits are the ones for you.If you are looking for Bluetooth headphones that are going to stay put no matter what (e.g. for exercise) and/or you like crispy bright highs and a balenced sound, go for the M30s.... Or get both like me!\n"", '\n  Definitely wasn’t expecting it to be so good for the price I paid.I own another pair of mpow earbuds and really like them. The only issue I had with my previous earphones was with the size of the buds (a bit too bulky) and that I struggled to keep them in my ears (not sure why!)But .. this ones solve all those issues!Fit my ears perfectly, won’t come out when I went for a quick run, easy to change song and volume and to pause and restart.If the battery is the same as my other mpow earphones (which seems like) it is just amazing.I use them intermittently but only had to charge the small box once (in more than a month!)Also, the charge and carry box is super small and portable. Charge and carry At the same time - just perfect.Overall, super happy with my purchase and recommended it 100%\n', ""\n  The Good:• Extremely compact design (small and smooth case makes handling quick and easy)• Fast and simple automatic pairing (after initial pairing)• Lightweight and comfortable (you can easily forget about them being in your ears)• Great battery performance (6 hours for buds, +29 hours for charging case)• 'Mono' mode allows for a single earbud to be used (great for when you want more awareness)• USB-C charging port (most 'budget' devices use Micro-USB)The Bad:• No wireless charging for the case, which would allow these buds to be truly 100% wireless• As with most touch controls, accidental activation can occur when adjusting buds once in-ear\n"", ""\n  One of the best wireless earphone you can get for bargain price. Sound and build quality is compareble to airpods.I got these small earbuds to use while working from home, they are pretty sleek and work great! Voice calls quality over Slack, Webex, Google Meet, etc have worked perfectly, people comment they can hear me very well and don't complain about background noise.I absolutely love the fact that they connect to and disconnect from your device automatically, and also that they automatically switch on when you remove them from the case, and switch off when you put them back in.These Mpow earbuds works great - sound quality is awesome, very responsive to a tap controls, black matt colour and best of all - great value for money.Finally, there's the added bonus of a USB-C charging port (hurray!) which is a good match for most modern chargers.Can't really go wrong at this price point.\n""]"

These so far are great! The battery life is heads and shoulders above my old airpods, and I love the fact you can easily monitor the battery life of both the case and the earbuds themselves.I'd highly recommend, with the one caveat that the sound definitely isn't 'bass-y', so if you like a super deep sound to your earbuds, these probably won't fit the bill, but are otherwise fantastic for the price!\n"", '\n  I am personally writing a review because of the battery life.

I was also pleased because the connection is very good I can walk out of my room to another room or down the hall and still have very good connection. So far the battery life has been great. I haven’t used the battery down to empty yet so don’t know how long it lasts on full. Overall very good product and happy with my purchase. I would recommend.\n', '\n  These are amazing, they arrived a day earlier than they said it would and they were 100% charged when they got here. When I put them in even without music on it canceled out the noise around me, when I connected them to my phone that sound was amazing. Connecting to my phone was a snap as well, I am completely amazed at the great quality for the price. I will be buying a pair for my wife and kids as well!!\n', '\n  I have tried many lower priced wireless earbuds in the past few years and these are definitely at the upper end!  Sound quality is fabulous - fit is similar in comfort and ease to Airpods (which I have!) and features such as right side blue tooth and easy charge case make these keepers!  VERY PLEASED so far....will check on durability which has been issue in past and update if these lose life/quality in few months.\n', '\n  I refused to spend over $100 for earphones which Could possibly fall out my ear and be lost at anytime so these were the perfect solution.

Now I can tend to my numerous zoom calls and meetings wirelessly!\n', ""\n  So far these seem great for $20!  Good range and battery life.  They fit super well in my ears.  Sound isn't worse than some $30 or $40 ones I've tried.  I like that the buttons actually press.  You do have to change the volume using the phone only.

I was looking at getting a WH-1000XM3 (the full-sized headphones) to use in my office, where I have both noisy neighbors and a loud HVAC system to deal with, but when I saw these come up for pre-order I thought they might work better for my use case (aka, not on an airplane).So far, here\'s the pros:Battery life is directly on the mark with what\'s advertised.  I used it in my office with noise cancelling on, volume at mid-levels from 11-5 before the left earphone actually died.  The right still had 20% - maybe using the touch controls for playback a lot causes quicker battery drain?Along with battery levels, charging from the case also seems on the mark.  After the earbuds died, I threw them in the case and left for a quick walk.  20 minutes later, my right earbud went from 20%->100%, and the left from 0%->70%.  Excellent imo, this more or less means I can just recharge my earbuds whenever I have a brief conversation with a coworker and never have to worry about the battery dying on me.Music quality is great.  These sound excellent on the ""Excited"" EQ preset to me, and I rotate through all kinds of genres, from (electronic) hardcore, 80s city pop, 00\'s nu and death metal, pop and R&B and rap.The noise cancelling - honestly, on a first wear, I was slightly disappointed.  I had read the pre-release reviews about how great it was, but when I started to use it out the box, I could still hear people talking to me.  Really, these won\'t block out loud/direct conversations, but that doesn\'t diminish their usefulness.  It completely eliminates the fairly loud HVAC noise in my office, and makes mouse clicks/non-mechanical keyboard usage fade out.  And that\'s without music playing.  Once you add music to the mix, these really do block out the world really effectively, even on low volumes.  I actually had a coworker today try to get my attention for a minute, of which I noticed nothing, before they resorted to a loud knock on my desk, which I actually thought was a part of the ambient soundtrack I was listening to at first.  Very impressed with the noise cancelling when combined with music, and even on its own with my tempered expectations.  They\'re not earplugs, but they\'re pretty darn close.A quick note: Using full noise cancelling when walking outside results in some annoying wind noise, but there\'s a preset called ""wind noise"" one step below full noise cancelling in the app that will completely kill that wind noise and still block other noises very well.Connectivity is great.  No issues connecting it to my TV, computer, Android phone, or iPad.  Protip: Hold the touch sensitive button on both ears for 7 seconds to enter pairing mode for connecting to a computer or non-Android/IOS device easily.The cons (aka, why I\'m saying 4.5 stars):No wireless charging.  It\'s a shame with the bulky case, and would make things way more convenient.No volume controls/option for volume controls.  Having to open use my device to change volume all the time is kind of more annoying than I originally thought it would be.No way to quickly change noise cancelling modes without the app.Those last two points are fairly understandable given the small(ish) size of the buds, but still would have been nice.  The ambient pass-through mode does work perfectly once you enable it in the app though.Overall, I really like these things and I\'m super satisfied with the risk I took ordering them before reviews came out.  If you\'re on the fence, I\'d buy these.  I\'ll update this review in the future if I have any other complaints/issues, but I\'m honestly really happy with these.EDIT 8-12-19: Two weeks have passed since I wrote this and I have a couple updates. One, you actually can quickly change the noise cancelling level by setting one of the touch controls to ""ambient sound control"" in the app. This lets you toggle between a couple different noise cancelling modes with a tap. I\'ve also started to use the adaptive sound control option, which I\'ve found to be pretty accurate and useful. I have mine set up so it\'s in full noise cancelling when I\'m sitting still, wind noise reduction when walking, ambient sound level 10 when running and full noise cancelling when on transportation. I\'ve only really tested the first two options since I don\'t run nor commute by public transit, but the app switches modes pretty quickly and it\'s convenient when I decide to go for a quick walk while working.I\'ve also noticed that every so often I do lose sync between sounds/video when connected to my tv, but it often fixes itself pretty quickly, or a pause-play will fix it as well. I haven\'t noticed it on my phone, so it\'s likely a mix of distance and the Bluetooth chipset on the TV.\n', '\n  I am convinced that these are the best earbuds that are on the market right now, with a couple of modifications. I have compared these against the Jabra Elites as well as Bose Soundsport Frees and these win hands down. I also have a large collection of over ear headphones, and the sound quality from these are easily on par, if not better. Here is a subjective list of pros/cons:Pros: sound quality, noise isolation, noise cancellation, passthrough quality, touch controls, battery/quick-chargingCons: stock tips/fit, microphone quality, lack of multipoint (NFC workaround)Sound Quality :First off, the sound quality is amazing on these, but you need to play around with the equalizer. I had the most success by setting the equalizer to ""mellow"" and then adjusting from there. The reason for this is because the treble and highs on these are fairly harsh out of the box. Music with loud vocals or high hats, etc. are EAR PIERCING without modification. Toning down the high ends significantly gives are more flat sound. The funny thing is that I found the opposite to be true for the WH-1000XM3s (headphone version of these earbuds). Another benefit is due to their isolation/noise canceling properties, you barely have to turn the volume above 50% to drown out ambient noise. This lends itself to much cleaner sounds and lower distortion.Noise Isolation/Cancellation:For the Sonys, I found the noise isolation to be significantly better than any other headphones that I have tried. They offer both silicone and soft foam tips out of the box, both of which successfully isolate outside noise. However, they didn\'t offer the best fit, but I will touch on that later. As far as noise canceling goes, these are comparable, but not as foolproof as the over the ear version. Things like loud talking, water faucets, crickets chirping, are not drowned out as easily as other sounds. Things like fans, hums, etc. will disappear almost completely. What they lack in NC, they make up for in noise isolation. A dash of increased volume helps drown out any other noises.Passthrough Quality:Compared to the Jabra Elites, the passthrough quality is far superior. By default, the left earbud controls ambient/noise cancelling controls, and a long press and hold on the left earbud allows passthrough of outside sounds. The sound quality is very natural, with almost no hiss or hum. The Jabras on the other hand sound like an old tape deck with lots of hiss in the background and had a much sharper tone.Battery/Quick-Charging:Any reasonable person will have no issue with battery on these. I have worn them for multiple hours at a time and the battery has not even dipped below 70%. Toss them in the case for a quick charge and you are back on the go.Touch Controls:I am a huge fan of touch controls as they don\'t involve you pushing the earbuds any further into your ears, which I don\'t find that comfortable to begin with, coming from the comfort of Bose ""stayhear"" tips. The left earbud cycles through ambient/noise cancelling modes and also allows for passthrough. The right earbud handles play, pause, skip/previous track. For phone calls, it\'s two double taps to answer, and two double taps to end. To enter pairing mode for a second device, press the touch sensors on both the left and right units for about 7 seconds. You can swap the controls among the earbuds as well as change it to google assistant or no effect. The only thing missing here is volume control. I get around this on my Apple Watch so it\'s not a huge deal breaker for me.Fit:I have never been that big of a fan of earbuds, but had success in the past with Bose due to their ""stayhear"" wing tips. Unfortunately, you can\'t put similar tips on these as they would no longer fit in the charging case. That being said, the Bose tips don\'t offer much noise isolation. I have small ear canals and even with the smallest tips, these would eventually fall out after light jostling, chewing, walking, etc. To get around this, I bought some Comply tips that also fit the Sony WF-1000x (Comply TrueGrip Pro Memory Foam Earphone Tips for Jabra Elite Sport, Master & Dynamic MW07, RHA TrueConnect, Sony WF-1000x, Sony WF-SP700N - Secure Fit Tips with SweatGuard) and now these are fantastic! They have a great fit and won\'t fall out. I can barely hear myself typing at my computer with the volume hovering around 50-60%.Microphone Quality:For calls, the incoming audio is great, but I have had many people tell me that I sound robotic or static-y. I\'ve had others tell me that I sound fine. It seems to vary based on the environment, but I am still testing. On the plus side, call sound comes out of both earbuds to give you stereo sound, something that the Bose Soundsport Frees do not offer.Update 5/2020: Sony pushed a firmware update that had significantly improved call quality according to others I\'ve talked to while using the earbuds. No longer having issues with static sounds or robotic sounds.Lack of Multipoint (NFC workaround):Coming from Bose, the lack of multipoint was my biggest gripe. If you don\'t know what multipoint is, it allows you to not only pair to multiple devices, but to also connect to multiple devices (usually two) at the same time. You can play music from one source, say your phone, and then you can start playing music from another source, maybe your laptop, and the transition is seamless. You don\'t have to disconnect/connect to switch audio sources. This is not true for the Sonys. On the bright side you do have a couple of options.If you have an Android phone, you can hot swap by tapping the NFC logo on the earbud case. From Sony (on Android)""If you touch an NFC-compatible smartphone to the charging case while the headset is connected to another Bluetooth device, you can switch the connection to the smartphone (One-touch connection switching). However, the connection cannot be switched when talking on a headset connected to a Bluetooth compatible mobile phone.When an NFC-compatible smartphone is connected to the headset, if the smartphone is touched by another NFC-compatible Bluetooth device (headset or speaker), the smartphone is disconnected from the headset and connected to the Bluetooth device.""If you have an iPhone, you can setup a shortcut that will easily get you to your bluetooth menu when you tap the case and then you are just one tap away. The shortcut is as follows: When NFC tag detected > URL - prefs:root=Bluetooth > Safari - Open URL.Using these approaches in tandem with the earbuds being hot swappable means that you do not have to disconnect/reconnect each time, as long as you have previously been paired with that device. You also get audio alerts saying ""bluetooth disconnected, bluetooth connected"" although it would be nice if it told you which device was being disconnected/connected on the audio prompt.Please rate this review as HELPFUL if you found any of the information of use!!\n', ""\n  Honestly guys if you want to go for premium, take airpod pro. If you want a set of decent pods, go for Jabra 75T but this pair of sony leaves you nowhere.Why shouldn't you buy it?Size of the case- It is huge, the main reason you use pods instead of headphones because they are convenient to carry. This case does not go into your pocket or even if it does, takes a large space.Call quality- The natural bass is so high that even if you have slight disturbance of network quality or call quality, you will get a hazing and irritating sound. This piece if very good for music but not good for calls at all.No IP rating- In Indian condition we will sweat a lot, having no IP rating can be dangerous - especially if it starts drizzling or effect of sweat.Does not fit into your ear- The size of the pods is huge, it is not convenient for running or exercise.Summary- If you are listening to music and you are a huge fan of Sony sound, calls are not important for you or you are not using this primarily during exercise- Go for it.If you are looking for a multipurpose pod with good for calls, exercise companion, value for money- this is not your choice.At this price point- airpod pro is 10 times better, JABRA 75 T is much cheaper and does a decent job as well.\n"", '\n  Me llegaron apenas hace unos minutos y al abrirlos me doy cuenta de que ya están usados\n', ""\n  Very Premium Design, Comfortable Fit, Can use for running or gymAmazing and Crystal Clear Sound Quality.With the software update sony has really improved the bass and max volume levels. Great Job. Now the sound is truly premium.Noise Cancelling is just top notch in its class. Keep in mind you can't compare it with the over the ear headphones WH-1000XM3.

You will definitely feel the difference.Many sound and control customisations options available through Sony headphones connect app.One of the best products from sonyCall quality is awesomeCan control volume using earbudsUpdate:After sony gave an update the performance increased significantly but the battery is worst it cannot last even 2-3 hrs with noise cancelling on and just watching movie or so with 50% of volume.got them replaced but still prob persists\n"", ""\n  Incase of battery issues, please turn off the DSEE HX since much difference mayn't be noted on usage.This review is based on some days usage and not long term. The Pros and Cons as based on my usage:Pros:1.The Sound Quality is excellent, there is no doubt on it. The bass is as required for TWS, there are no comparisons with Over Ear Bass creepers. Pick any song type and this does the job.2.ANC is good, cannot compare with the WH-1000XM3, but does the job. you will hear some sound from outside but once the song start to kick in the outer-world sound goes off. It is good to binge on movies sports and song. This has 6mm driver and do not expect much from it.3.The battery Life is good in ANC enabled mode, but in your daily activity you will not need much ANC since this almost knocks out noise in normal mode. DSEE HX mostly upscaling the sound quality nearly to the premium feel of Hi-Res.4. Call quality is ok ok compared to airpods, which means it is not up to the mark even after the update.5. Sony headphones app is an extra advantage for manual selective of equalizer modes, touch controls.Cons: Anything of this world has Pros and cons and these TWS are no exception:1. Aptx, Aptx HD and LDAC less, means you cannot assure the best connectivity with some phones but Sony's own QN1es does the job for most connectivity.2. Connectivity in laptop is worse while listening to online music and youtube videos.3. The TWS is large and weighs 8.5g each compared to the airpods of 4g each. But if depends on how you use.4. Its not IP rated well these are not made for workouts.Finally if you are looking for a premium headphones to listen to these are the ones if you have the budget for it, or else there are other brands on the market which costs less. The sound quality of the TWS is evident from the name itself SONY.\n"", '\n  En general de los que probe (1.-Bose SoundSports Free 2.- Powerbeats pro) fueron los peores...De lo que revise, en teoria estos estaban en primer lugar para audio, sin embargo no los sentí superioresComodidad (3 Estrellas).- Probe diferentes gomas, pero siempre quedaba con la sensación de que se podían caer, nunca logre sentir que tapara de manera correcta el oido para aislar el sonido, y creo que eso tuvo un efecto en la comodidad del mismo.Seguridad (2 Estrellas).- Nunca logre sentirme seguro con ellos, haciendo diferentes pruebas de mover la cabeza se me aflojaron un par de ocasiones sin caer. Estos no están echos para ejercicio, intente salir a correr con ellos y los tuve que ajustar un par de ocasiones, definitivamente no los recomendaría para ejercicio.Sonido(3.5 Estrellas).- El sonido, esperaba que fuera superior a los Bose por mucho, sin embargo fue similar. Al no lograr cubrir de manera correcta el oido creo que afecto un poco la calidad, esto es en mi caso y con las gomas incluidas en el paquete.Batería (5 Estrellas).- No tuve problemas con la bateria durante las pruebas, y esto considerando que se utiliza el Noise Cancelling.Llamadas (1 Estrellas).- Para llamadas definitivamente no fue lo mejor, para escuchar el sonido es cómo básico (como el que esperas de cualquier manos libres de 500 pesos) y la voz en las pruebas que hice, se nota inmediatamente que estas hablando con manos libres, lo cual no esta mal, pero para la calidad de sony y el precio, esperaria algo mejor.Tiene una opción adicional para tocar el audífono y que deje pasar el ruido de afuera, es como si tuviera un pequeño microfono y te deja escuchar bien, sin pausar la música, ese feature me encanto la verdad, sin embargo al no sentirlos muy seguros y la mala calidad de la llamada fueron decisivos para dejarlos en ultimo lugar.La calidad de audio es importante para mi, considerando que es wireless no soy tan estricto y el sonido es bueno pero el simple hecho de tener que comprar si Bose o Sony se escuchaban mejor (el sonido es bastante similar) fue una decepción ya que es el punto de venta de estos y debería ser claramente superior\n']"
