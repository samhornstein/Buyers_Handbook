Thanks to PS5 your Xbox is going to cost $300, $500 and thanks to Xbox the PS5 will cost significantly less than what they would want to charge!Remember that this generation they are actually losing money delivering these powerful consoles at these price points!

It was fairly easy to put on, but I am only giving it 4 stars because some of the sticker placement on the controller portion is questionable.

Didn’t give it 5 stars because even after using a card to push bubbles out, some still kept appearing and it came with a lot of tiny scratch marks.\n', '\n  Looks really good! My son loved the look! It comes well packed and I had zero problems installing. I would recommend some electronic wipes, that is what I used and I stuck well and is still stuck 7 months later. If you dust it I would use a soft screen wipe or something, seems easily scratched but cant say for sure. We always dust electronics with specialty cloth.\n', '\n  It was easy to install and remove if you messed up.

If you mess up at putting anything on, it stretches out and is unusable at that point.\n']"
