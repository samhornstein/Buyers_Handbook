I pre-ordered the game on Amazon, and again, like the last game I pre-ordered it was promised on release day.  Then both were pushed back a day, then somehow both mysteriously disappeared in shipping. Both times went to Target and bought the game. At Target today you got a cool Mario 3d world metal water bottle. Never again Amazon. Target will get my video game dollars from this point forward. The game itself is great. Only played the first world on 3D world and a little of Bowsers Fury. As expected,  the game looks and plays great.  Five stars for the game, One star for Amazon.\n', ""\n  Hard to believe that this past year, we celebrated the 35th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers. While it had not been as strong as many gamers had expected, we still got a lot of great toys and games featuring Nintendo's proud mascot. We got the Super Mario 3D All-Stars package, which had Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Sunshine & Super Mario 64. But other Mario titles flowed to the Switch as well like Paper Mario: The Origami King. Still, when you look at games from the Wii U, you had almost all of the Mario games go to Switch already, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and New Super Mario Brothers U Deluxe. But one game that has not made it to Switch until now is Super Mario 3D World. The game was well-received for Wii U owners, but not as strongly sold, due to the lackluster sales of Wii U. Still, Nintendo pressed on and decided to release it for the Switch. Sadly, the game was suppose to be released last year, but got held back due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now it is here, with a added bonus.Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, is a 2-in-1 purr-fectly conjured compilation where Super Mario 3D World is remastered and includes new features made for Switch, and the new mini-adventure Bowser's Fury which takes a unique twist on the Mario formula. First for Super Mario 3D World, the game looks great and brings in all the wonderfully made platforming from the Wii U game, with some small tweaks to make it work a bit better. In the game, Mario & his friends need to rescue Pixie Princesses that Bowser and his minions have captured. Along the way, Mario, Peach, Toad & Luigi each all maneuver with new and returning features  like the thrilling Cat Suit, which allows Mario & friends to maneuver in new and challenging ways. You can now climb up walls, attack like a feline and skid through pathways that are more challenging than ever. You also have courses that are new for Switch owners to hover through like Red-Hot Run, The Great Goal Pole, and the towering Champion's Road which will get you screaming for more.You also have a new game here: Bowser's Fury, where Mario must team-up with Bowser Jr. in a epic quest to save Bowser from a uncontrollable raging toxin where got into and becomes Fury Bowser (a towering Ganon-like creature) bent on mayhem to destroy Lake Lapcat. In this game, Mario must partner with Bowser Jr. on the quest to save Bowser from the raging being he has became. The game plays more like a Super Mario Odyssey adventure with Mario 3D World twists, packed-down into 1 major overworld. In the game, Mario and Bowser fight cat-themed foes like Boom Boom, Bullies and unlock puzzles and collect items and find the guarded cat shines to unlock bells that will help Mario & Bowser Jr. stop the unraveled Fury Bowser. The game itself is fun, but does feel interesting as a concept to make a condensed Super Mario 64-esque game. It works well, and the game looks amazing with the designs and platforming. In itself, the campaign may be short, but will take your fiery breath away when you play it. I think it looks charming and puts in a new wrinkle on the Mario 3D platforming formula that worked so well from past games like Super Mario Galaxy 2.There are a lot of things that work well with both of these games, with a few faults though. First of all, for Bowser's Fury, for skilled gamers of past Mario platformers, they may find the game shorter than other Mario titles, because of the main overworld. Some gamers would've wanted more overworld packed into the hub-world like earlier Mario titles, but it is actually interesting to put Mario into a Luigi's Mansion kind of setting. Also, you would also have to toggle with many different power-ups at once while battling Fury Bowser in the game that you may need that as a lifeline without losing lives. It may be shocking but sadly it is what it takes at times while controlling Mario & Bowser Jr. while mastering Bowser's Fury. While it may be repetitive, it still is a lot of fun playing. As for Super Mario 3D World, the main disadvantage is only if you have mastered the Mario adventure before from the Wii U era, you may not feel entertained with this game all over again. But nevertheless, considered that so many people never played the Wii U title, considered it was one of the weakest-selling game system from the Nintendo legacy, it still is worth playing at the end.When you look at Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, it is a mixed bag for some fans of the Super Mario Brothers legacy. But nevertheless, it is a absolutely fun title worth checking out. You get two adventures of the furry-kind into one package that does work. While many people may feel Super Mario 3D World is not a strong buy, it is a strong buy because it is 2 adventures into one nearly purr-fect pair of escapades. As for Bowser's Fury, I did get what I wanted out of it, and would still want to intrigued with more when I missed on it. Still for what it is worth, pairing the 2 games in one compilation is worth the money. If they were sold apart, it would not be worth purchasing. Still, I absolutely recommend buying this game pack a lot. It can come across as a great pair of actual purr-fect strangers.Graphics: A-Sound: B+Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: Super Mario 3D World: A- for Solo: B+ for Multiplayer Bowser's Fury: B For Solo & MultiplayerOverall: B+\n"", ""\n  I've played games since the NES, I've owned every Nintendo system ever made. Mario is my jam so when I saw this game with a cool kitty cat power I was psyched. Played this for 30 minutes with my 3 kids and I'm pretty sure we all need therapy. The camera has a very small range and chases the person farthest ahead. The chasing is common with Mario, the small camera range makes it a nightmare. It also is 3D so there is foreground and background to explore, not a single linear course. This might work as a single player or maybe two player cooperative but not four. It also randomly switches your characters at the start or stages, huge huge tear fest with the little kid crowd. Not good. Definitely a huge letdown plumber brothers\n"", '\n  Been waiting for this since it was announced and never had a chance to play it on my Wii U while I owned one.  Game is absolutely  stellar!  Definitely my favorite Mario game of all time.\n', '\n  So much fun to play in tandem with my kids! Thank you, Nintendo!Nintendoes Forever!!!❤️🎮\n', ""\n  I'm 32 and have been playing Mario games literally since I can remember. They were great then and are still great now. Bottom line: if you like Mario games, you'll love this one.\n"", ""\n  So much fun with the perfect amount of challenge. Love being able to play the game as Luigi instead of Mario's hat, that's for sure! I haven't played Super Mario in 30 years but I picked up the controller and was able to pick up where I left off and impressed my 8 year old son! I loved and appreciated the familiarity of the classic characters and was instantly addicted to playing with AND against my son, lol! If you're looking for a fun game for all ages, then I definitely recommend you buy this now - you won't regret it!!! Love, love, love it!!!\n"", '\n  I never owned a WiiU so I had no idea the game existed.  My family got me a Switch for Xmas as I was ""borrowing"" my teen-aged daughters to play the Untitled Goose Game a lot.  Decided I wanted to try a Mario game so I pre-ordered this one with no history on it.  Our last Nintendo system was the Wii in 2006 when the kids were younger and the I did not care for the Mario Galaxy game 3D aspect.  This, though, it seems to do an outstanding job with the classic elements of the game with some modern movement.  I am having a blast playing this one.  I\'ll probably end up getting the game card for both my kids.

I am a Discover Card ""Member"".While visiting the Nintendo Eshop, I decided I wanted to get a new game: Super Mario Odyssey.Clickety, click and off I go to their shopping cart.Suddenly my heart sinks. My pulse rises. I can\'t believe my eyes. Nintendo does not accept Discover Card!Rather than just closing my browser then and there. Grabbing my Switch and tossing it in the trash. I realized this must be some sort of mistake? Clearly. I felt discriminated against, personally attacked even.Breathe for a moment. Settle down. There must be some way around this. My very first thought was Amazon.Well, a moment later and I\'m looking at these gift cards. My only worry was how long it would take to receive the codes. How would I receive the codes. Etc.I proceeded. Bought a $50 and a $10 in order to buy the game in question. Went through Amazon checkout with my Discover Card in hand. Within one minute I had everything I needed to place my order with Nintendo. The codes for the eCash were provided instantly and I didn\'t have to wait at all.Amazon saved the day, and I didn\'t have to resort to using a different card.Fast transaction, instant codes, happy customer.\n', ""\n  This is my son's preferred way to add money to his Nintendo Switch. We order it from Amazon and then he types in the code on his Switch immediately and he's good to go. Getting the code is a bit tricky if you don't know where to look on Amazon. You have to go to Your Orders but instead of the general orders you have to click on the tab that says Digital Orders. There you'll find two sets of numbers. It's the second number you want. We've bought this 'card' in several different increments and all have been great. If you want your child to buy able to purchase games but not have your credit card linked to his/her account, this is a good way to do it.\n"", ""\n  I bought 2 of these like 2 hours ago still don't got any codes all its saying is verification pending what's the deal\n"", '\n  I just found out today that the Ultra Pokémon versions had just been released recently and wanted to play it right away without having to order the game and wait for it to arrive at my doorstep. I didn’t want to enter all my new credit card info onto the game console so I decided to go the Amazon route. Buying the ecash gift card allowed me to input the code to add funds in the Nintendo eshop so I was able to purchase the game right from the Nintendo 3ds xl and download it right away. I highly recommend this for people who don’t want to wait for their Nintendo gift card to arrive in the mail.\n', '\n  everything i read stated the delivery of the code would be instant. that was not the case for my order. it took some digging into a help article but in there i found that in some cases human verification of your order has to take place to assure fraud is not occurring. the process could take 4 hours. my verification only took about 5 mins. but i was pretty confused for those 5 minutes.woulda been nice to know about the verification thing ahead of time.but regardless of that, easy to buy and easy to redeem. i wanted to use my amex which nintendo doesn’t accept. thanks for being open, amazon\n', ""\n  It's so handy to come here and purchase these for the e-shop. I often use either my amazon gift cards I get here and there to buy 3DS games, or there once was a time when I had an American Express which Nintendo doesn't accept which left me with having to go this route, except at the time It wasn't as easy as it is buying from this Store and I had to wait two days for someone to send me a scanned card that they must have just purchased, scratched off and sent to me once they got my money. But here, I purchase the e-shop card and so far the longest it's taken to get my e-shop code is 5 minutes.

I had 5 dollars on an amazon gift card that I was hoping I could turn into 5 dollars on my 3DS, and it worked! So, if you\'re scared about ordering, don\'t be! Oh, and if you\'re wondering where to find your redemption code, it\'s in your e-mail.

There's no concept art, interviews, scans of the instruction manual, box art, basically anything other collections have done far better than this effort from Nintendo.

Love old games and platinum'd Meat Boy, Sekiro, and nearly Death Stranding so I'm used to hard and frustrating, but holy cow 64 and Sunshine need quality of life updates BAD.Played a bit of Mario 64 and had to stop because the camera is just awful and it has not aged well. Unless you're already really familiar I just don't see anyone enjoying it unless you REALLY like kinda clunky 3d platformersI'm 33 stars into Sunshine and it's just such a slog getting kicked to the main area every single time you die that I'm already getting tired of it.L1 brings up a map which has a 3 second animation to open and close every time you accidentally press it trying to long jump or whatever.long unskippable cutscenes, slow text boxesYour fludd nozzle gets changed anytime you go anywhere so i tend to fall to my death expecting to have the hover jets equipped constantly but nope.It's by far the most charming 3d Mario I've played but it's rough.Just started Galaxy and it still has the Wii UI and you have to use motion controls just to select a save spot and start the game. changing my rating to 1 star, i hate this and am going to sell it as soon as i get tired of SunshineEdit*64 doesn't get better than just jumping around the castle for me, the levels are just not very fun.Got 83 stars in Sunshine and im not bothering with the last 2 red coin missions. It's a buggy, untested game with lots of charm but it generally kinda sucks outside of aesthetics. Every problem I listed annoyed me the entire playthrough. Also every single thing involving yoshi is bad. Feeding him, the unmovable egg, spawn location, dying in water, and i think he just explodes when his fruit meter runs out? i honestly dont get why they even put him in this game. its just redundant with fludd, he jumps slightly higher and sprays water... cool.Galaxy is weird. collecting sparkles sucks and it has the worst camera of the bunch, touchscreen is bad, button prompts are big shaking joycons, and the beginning is kinda awful. but once i started crawling around on the giant bee it got a lot better.

And now they've come in HD to the Nintendo Switch, and I couldn't be any more ecstatic.Some people might complain that these games (particularly SM64) weren't remade akin to Spyro/Crash/etc trilogies. In my opinion, that doesn't detract from anything at all. Would it have been nice? Sure, but these games are some of the best games of all time, and the original graphics create that nostalgia that I feel Nintendo was going for with this compilation.I can't wait to sink my time into all 3 of these classics again, and I'm grateful that the switch now has almost all of Mario's greatest games on it.

The games are very basic (not like some of the delightfully difficult games in the original). There are no special game versions like the old one. When you play split screen games, it does a full four-way split even if you're playing with AIs, so it's hard to see. It's slow to load everything. The algorithm for earning tickets is all over the place. You may earn 40 tickets for first place or you may earn 3. And once you do unlock all the games (it took us less than an hour) there's no real goal to work towards other than some weird outfit items. Oh and the games aren't real carnival games.

I almost did not  buy game because of  that complaint. Imagine my surprise when it took me all of 45 minutes of play  to unlock all the games.

It is a good mix that will entertain children and  pass some time for adults. Up to 4 players can play each game and if you play alone you play against 3 AIs at you choice of easy, medium and hard. once you unlock all the games, use can use your tickets to unlock customizations for you game character avatar.

This wouldn't be a problem - but the gameplay mechanics are so bad...\n"", ""\n  This product was pretty good I loved it at first <3 but later on I figured out it was all the same controls for every minigame which made it quite boring but the minigames them selves were pretty good. The minigames repeated they had at least 30 minigames which may seem like a lot but It seems like a little when u play them all since it's all the same basically lol. I liked this product a lot but wouldn’t play it all the time since u may get bored of it soon enough.

You really don't need to read another review, Zelda alone is worth the price of a switch. Like if they sold this game for 300 dollars I would probably buy it. In fact, it's the only Switch game I own, and have no real plans to purchase anything else because between the original game and Master Mode, I will be getting a divorce soon so I can spend more time collecting mushrooms and climbing mountains.\n"", ""\n  This is how you revitalize a franchise that was starting to grow stale in it's formula. I bought a Switch just to play this game and I do not regret my purchase. I'm going to go over pros and cons to make this review a little easier to read.PROS:+ HUGE OPEN WORLD - Lots of interesting places and things to discover. It's quite exhilarating to scale a mountain in order to get a better view of everything around you and then paraglide to points of interest. If you can see a place on the map, you can get to it.+ COMBAT EXPERIMENTATION - Combat experimentation is fun and rewarding, for awhile (more explanation in 'cons' section).+ FUN AND VARIED COMBAT (FOR AWHILE) - Different enemy types are interesting and have specific tactics that clearly telegraph their moves making combat a rewarding learning experience and almost never feels cheap.+ RPG ELEMENTS - The RPG elements fit very nicely into the Zelda universe and give the game a lot of depth. Mountable horses have different stats, enemies can have different elemental types along with stronger variations, weapons, armor, and shields have wildly different stats and abilities, food and elixirs provide different buffs, etc.+ GAME DIFFICULTY - The game is relatively difficult compared to previous Zelda games. You really have to assess combat situations before entering the fray and many enemies are punishing. You will die, many times, but you do learn, with time, and with learning comes triumph and satisfaction. DLC adds Master Mode for the most hardcore players or those who found Normal too easy.+ COOKING SYSTEM - Cooking system is deep and rewards experimentation. Cooking not only allows for the crafting of meals and elixirs which gives you numerous buffs, but it's also one of the best ways to make money.+ WEAPON DURABILITY - Weapon and shield durability forces you to continually hunt for new gear and keeps combat interesting and tense. While I didn't think I would like this system at first, it makes for a much more engaging game than just getting a single, over-powered item and just relying on that the rest of the game, which would get boring, imo.+ SHRINES - There's over 120 'shrines' which are peppered all over the map which act like mini-dungeons. They usually can be completed in 10 minutes or less and usually involve the use of several of Link's Runes (that you get at the beginning of the game) that give you the ability to move metallic objects from a distance, throw bombs, summon ice pillars, or even freeze objects and apply force to them to launch into enemies or to other places to help solve puzzles. I love these shrines because they're fun to solve, and due to the game's physics engine, many can be solved in ways the developers probably didn't intend (look up YouTube videos on it). Shrines are short enough that they're not a huge time investment like normal Zelda dungeons that used to demand an hour+ of your time to complete, making them ideal for short gaming sessions.+ NO HAND HOLDING - Doesn't explain much, doesn't hold your hand, and expects you to learn everything from the world, NPCs, and experimentation.CONS:- BARREN FEELING OPEN-WORLD - The world feels very barren and empty, much of the time. Many say the map is 'dense' but I don't think that's an accurate word to describe it. The map is loaded with things to do, but there is lots of empty space between those points of interest. Think if you took the map of Skyrim (a game I would call 'dense') and expanded it by 3 times the size, including time to travel between points of interest. Horses don't really help with traversal especially when you're moving across mountainous or rocky terrain.- COMBAT GETS STALE - Combat experimentation becomes less effective as you become stronger. Ambushes with bombs, chu chu jellies, stasis, etc, all become less and less rewarding as enemies become stronger. Before, a carefully aimed bomb could kill an enemy, outright, or roll into barrels which would take out an entire encampment, now a bomb does roughly 5% damage and most other means are hardly worth the effort over just using brute-force. For a game that really rewarded this kind of behavior at the start, I was bummed that I couldn't rely on those tactics later in the game, adding to the combat feeling stale and repetitive after awhile.- CAN'T SUMMON HORSES FROM ANYWHERE - Horses cannot be summoned from anywhere. The DLC solves this with 2 different solutions, but it should have been in the base game and been an early quest/reward before you spend 50+ hours exploring the map. This was super frustrating to me when walking to Gerudo town, which ended up being close to 25 minutes of walking/running from the nearest shrine. A horse would have made this trek much more bearable but there were no stables nearby to even take it out of.- INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND GENERAL UI - Inventory management and the menu UI could use a little work. While I loved having so many interesting items and ingredients to discover and experiment with, moving through the menus got tedious, especially when you have multiple pages of stuff to sort through or when you find new, better weapons/shields and have to go back into your menus to drop some to make space. Menus felt cluttered and even after 80 hours, I would still fumble through menus trying to do specific things.- PERFORMANCE AND LOAD TIMES - The game runs pretty well a majority of the time, but there are certain places where it will chug, specifically when there's lots of particle effects on-screen or there's a lot of things to render. This also makes load times get kind of old, as it can take up to 20 seconds to load into new areas or even just reload the area you are in, after dying. Even dying in a shrine results in a 10 second reload, which is baffling since they're not in the open-world and shouldn't take that long to render, especially when they've already been rendered before your death.- GRAPHICS - While the game looks pretty good most of the time, there's other times that the hardware limitations really show, like when you're trekking across big meadows or rocky mountains with little detail. It looks really good for a handheld system, but doesn't quite hold up to console standards, even compared to last gen.- EXPLAINS NOTHING - While I love that the game doesn't hold your hand, I was equally frustrated by not having a clue how to do certain things. While a purist would argue that all the answers are SOMEWHERE in the game or that you should just experiment, someone like me just doesn't have the patience to play 90% of the games content to then find out that a certain ability will significantly help map traversal and reduce travel time. I want to know these things up-front or at the latest, halfway through the game, since getting an ability to improve travel time feels less rewarding when I've already slowly trekked through a vast majority of the map at 60 hours. DLC rewards are not as great if you have nearly completed and covered the entire base game... what's the use of a horse or motorcycle you can summon anywhere if you don't have anything left to explore?Anyways, I absolutely love this game and would like to give it 4.5 stars. I think it deserves better than a 4, but not quite a perfect score of a 5. Given the number of rather large gripes that I had with the game, I felt it important to round down to a 4 instead. I really look forward to the next game but I hope people can acknowledge and admit the game's shortcomings, otherwise, these things won't be fixed in order to give us the most refined and amazing follow-up that we all are already salivating for.\n"", ""\n  I tried, and tried, and tried ... I've put in maybe 30 hours to date, and I've gotten basically nowhere. And I don't really feel like moving on at this point.This is a huge, HUGE game. I've explored maybe 10%. The graphics are excellent, the soundtrack is great if a bit minimalist. It's big, it's WIDE open, and it's super-involved. Weapons break on you. Stocks of ammunition (i.e. arrows) run out. If you want to eat, you need to collect and then cook your food. If you want to cook your food you need to find yourself some fire. And on, and on.Big, open, involved -- all of these are probably plusses for a lot of gamers, and this game has certainly received its fair share of great reviews. But here's the thing: I'm an adult, with a real life and responsibilities. And every time I sit down in front of this game I spend two or three hours collecting supplies and cooking food and fighting various monsters, all without making much progress. Why bother?!Breath of the Wild, maybe it's not you. Maybe it's me. But you're no Link Between Worlds. You're certainly no Ocarina of Time. You feel like a big mess of a game that just doesn't quite come together and, as phrased so brilliantly by Sweet Brown, ain't nobody got time for that.\n"", ""\n  I  bought this for my kids because of the great memory I had playing Zelda 2 when I was a kid.  That was one of the most challenging and rewarding games I had ever finished.  I've not played video games for over 25 years until getting the switch and BOTW.  I am amazed at how much gaming has improved and how much I've missed out!  I like that this game is not all about fighting and is not too violent and gruesome.  The game is fun for all ages and even my youngest 5 year old boy enjoys playing it, although he mostly just explores the villages and experiment with cooking.  The biggest problem with this game is that it is so addictive that we'll play it all day and don't want to do anything else. So my wife is not too happy.\n"", ""\n  If you are a Zelda fan and/or a fan of Western RPG's like the Elder Scrolls series (for example) then you will LOVE this game. Hundreds of hours can be spent playing this game and exploring the VAST map that this game touts. Like nothing else the Zelda series have ever seen and that's all before the DLC that will be released later this year.Gameplay and the story is largely engrossing. You won't want to turn off your Nintendo Switch and you will be glad you purchased one if for nothing else than for the ability to play this game...but don't sleep, there's TONS of great Nintendo 1st party titles on the horizon that Nintendo fans will WANT TO PLAY!Back to Zelda though, the atmosphere, graphics, sound and gameplay are all SPOT ON. There's crafting of Food, Potions, Weapons and Armor as well as a bunch of quests, side quests and tons of hidden content to keep you engrossed for at least the next several months... The Game of the Year buzz that this game has received is 100% deserved. Get this game! You will LOVE It!\n"", '\n  No es ninguna broma y no soy un fan ciego de Nintendo puesto que tambien cuento con Xbox One y PS4. Pero este juego vale mucho la pena. Este juego es gigante son como 20 juegos en uno puedes hasta surfear en Nieve. Surfear en Arena. Te gustan los calabozos bueno este juego cuenta con mas de 120 digo mas por que para encontrar algunos calabozos necesitas hacer algunos acertijos que contarian como otra manera de hacer calabozos para que aparezcan los otros calabozos. Hay semillas regadas por todo el mapa mas de 800 y cada semilla es otro acertijo. Y 4 calabozos principales de la historia. Mas de 300 armas demasiadas armaduras demasiados escudos. Enemigos poderosos el sistema de batalla es impresionante. Ya no me acuerdo de tanto que da este juego es casi ilimitado si lo quieres acabar al 100%. He pagado ese mismo precio por otros juegos y la verdad no contienen ni el 15% de contenido con todo y si bajaras el DLC de lo que te da este Zelda solito es impresionante. Bien por Nintendo me impresiono. Pagar este precio por zelda la verdad se me hace muy barato y mas que te da mas de 300 horas de juego si lo quieres acabar al 100% con todo.No me lo espere.\n', '\n  my whole family loves this game.a very lengthy quest.we spent a lot of time completing it.about gameplay no need to say anything,internet is full with reviews of this remarkable game..zelda games are the star attraction of nintendo platform.awakens memories of playing zelda on older nintendo systems.must buy if you own a nintendo switch and if you dont own a nintendo switch then purchase the console solely  to play this game.games like zelda on nintendo or god of war on ps4 are the main reason that people buy these consoles.\n', '\n  El juego es muy bueno, no se que mas pueda decir de un Zelda, este al introducir un mundo abierto garantiza cientos de horas de diversión, ya dependerá de cuanto quieras invertir de tiempo en el juego, pero el mismo no te decepcionara, el envío fue rapidísimo al día siguiente, incluso me dijeron que ya hacen entregas también los domingos aquí en Guadalajara, una excusa mas para ser miembro prime, son de esas pocas veces que realmente sientes que una membresía si te da un valor agregado, y en este caso Amazon no me ha decepcionado.

Personally, I would say this title alone is worth getting a Switch for. The amount of care and effort that has gone into this game is very evident from all the fun that you can have.This game goes back to the roots of the first Zelda on the NES, and lets you loose in a vast open world (after completing a tutorial-like section). A lot of the story is implied, not said out loud. As such there aren't many talking characters but the few cut-scenes are a joy to watch.The game looks fantastic even in portable mode, and the new art style for this game adds another layer of charm to this game.This game is slightly challenging however, as the enemies you face always scale up to you and inventory management becomes slightly tedious because of the mechanic in which all shields and weapons will break after some usage.If you want, you can run straight to the castle with link in his underpants to defeat Ganon with a stick. The game won't stop you, though the fight may convince you about the need to collect better gear from the various enemy creatures first.\n""]"

Not only are they incredibly fun, but they also serve as my primary workout regime. In 2012 I had cancer surgery which kept me off my feet for some time, and Just Dance really helped me bounce back and lose upwards of 60 pounds that first year with very little modification to my diet. I continued to dance literally every single day for about three years, resulting in not only a slimmer, more toned body, but I also FELT better than ever. Unfortunately, after my cancer resurfaced in 2016, the ensuing surgeries and permanent nerve damage have prevented me from exercising on the level I used to, but I do still like to pop these games in a few times a week and was happy to pick up the latest. But enough of my sob story. I only wanted to mention these things now so any criticisms I might make come off as more credible and not just the rantings of a casual player who simply can't keep up with the steps or hold the controller properly. Trust me, I know these games inside out by now, lol.I will try to avoid writing my usual thesis – but no promises, lol – and just say that, in short, JD2021 is a decent-to-good installment of the series. In terms of interface and gameplay it’s about the same as the last few entries, which I think is a good thing because it finally found a format that works. I used to dread popping in a new game each year and re-learning how to navigate the damn thing, lol, but if you have played any Just Dance game in the last five years or so this will look familiar to you. The motion tracking on the Switch joy-con is fair, though some simple and straightforward moves such as pointing your hand to the sky or turning around in a circle still fail to register on occasion, and the graphics are colorful and fluid and you get to play as a variety of whimsical characters. There are also a ton of new player icons, titles, and artwork to unlock if you’re so inclined. The Just Sweat and World Dance Floor modes return, as well as a small selection of songs geared toward small children specifically. (And I’m sorry, I may be 38, but that Alphabet Song remix is dope.) My only sorta-gripe is with the choreography itself, which this time around seems to rely more on bizarre hand posing rather than actual footwork and movement. As a single player just looking to stay fit I don’t necessarily feel like I’m benefitting from much of a workout as I do with previous titles, though it might still be fun for small groups and gatherings.As with every new Just Dance game in recent years, you also get a free 30-day trial of Just Dance Unlimited, which is basically an online database of over 500 tracks from games past, though a Ubisoft Club account is mandatory to access it. Regarding Unlimited, I strongly advise disregarding any 1-star review which tries to tell you this is an “incomplete” game. You get 40-ish songs on the cartridge, which is more or less the standard and quite reasonable for the retail price point. What you’re paying extra money to access, and is completely optional, is access to almost every song from previous Just Dance games. It’s an entirely different service unto itself and absolutely nothing in this game is locked behind a paywall. Please, please educate yourself before making (or buying into) such claims. I do happen to subscribe to Unlimited on top of continuing to purchase the new physical game releases every year, and find it completely worth it. Like I said, I try to dance several times a week, if my body is up for it.The tracklist itself will be hit or miss depending who you ask. Each year it gets a little less mainstream with heavy emphasis on world music and underground techno beats, which is not necessarily a complaint for me but I can see why others may be disappointed. That said, there is still a pretty good selection here of popular radio tracks from the likes of Harry Styles, Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga, and even Eminem. (Personally I would have liked more 80s and 90s music.) All in all I think JD 2021 is a solid entry in the series, embodying the fun and whimsy of the earlier games but with a modern polish that doesn’t compromise the gameplay itself. (For a few games there is was SO stylized to the point where you couldn’t even see what your dancer was supposed to be doing.) At this point I really just appreciate that they keep making these games at all and continue to appeal to a wide range of demographics. So, whether your goal is to shed a few pounds or just goof around for a few minutes, everyone should find at least one thing here to love.\n"", ""\n  I have all the Just Dance games--and granted, I'm going a bit nutty with all this staying at home during the pandemic, but this game may be my favorite. The songs are a great mix of genres, and the choreography has enough familiar moves to make the game comfortable to jump into, but it also has some new moves that I don't think I've seen in the other Just Dance games. And the backgrounds--wow--they are amazing. It's crazy to think how far the game has come over the years. Five stars for sure!\n"", '\n  Be prepared to shell out for the subscription service - while there\'s a decent library included, you won\'t get the ""good stuff"" without subscribing, though there is a decent free trial.**Also note that you cannot log into multiple devices or profiles (!!!) with the same subscription account.** That means that if Amy and Suzie are using the same switch but Suzie doesn\'t want Amy playing the game with her Switch profile, mom and dad are buying two subscriptions just to get the same content for each profile.While ""they can share"" is generally a valid answer, it\'s really not great subscription management. It also doesn\'t work if two people in the same family are geographically separated and want to play together. Does not make sense for a family game.The subscription also brings in a ton of familiar songs - but wait! Does that mean I\'m paying AGAIN for songs that were in previous versions, that were already created and sold to me? YES! You might think that the $60 price tag would pay for those, but I guess not. DON\'T FORGET that you\'re paying for the subscription service to keep accessing those (previously created and paid for songs).So why is this game $60?I don\'t know.\n', ""\n  I really like to just dance 2020 one game I watch some clips on YouTube it's really fun and I want to try it out once I have it I already have it now and I've got the one that it's for Nintendo but I don't have the Nintendo yet but I'm going to give it get it on Thanksgiving Day or Christmas I might ask answer for the Nintendo switch but I bet it's going to be the coolest game I ever played I give it a 5-star review\n"", '\n  Video games and dancing are two of my favorite pastimes, and somehow I had never bought Just Dance before! I am a former Zumba and cardio dance instructor and have to admit this can also be a great workout. I already went through 40 songs of Just Dance 2021 this morning (game just arrived yesterday), and it was a blast. There’s a great mix of moves from hip-hop, modern, Zumba, etc. and while I only recognized five or so of the songs, it was still enjoyable. From a workout perspective, it can be a little heavier on the right arm and quad, so I suggest switching up the legs and also using the left arm more instead of just mirroring the game - as long as your right arm is mirroring, you’ll still get the 5 stars. I am pretty certain I’ll be subscribing to the unlimited soon.\n', '\n  \xa0Heads up to those who want a nice packaged game case to hold the game inside. It’s completely busted and looks like my dog chewed it but If you don’t plan on keeping the boxes like I do then it’s not a problem. The price was amazing and the only thing I care for is their game working. Which it does so I’m rating this 4/5. It only seems fair to deduct one because of packaging.\n', '\n  Super genial\n', ""\n  As the title says, there are ads in this game. When playing this game we had to sit through an unskippable video advertisement for their monthly subscription service. They also fill the song selection screen with songs you can only play with their subscription service. Which by the way, is $25/year -- The same price as a Nintendo Switch Online Membership. Effectively doubling the price.They try really hard to show you all the songs you CAN'T play. Constantly shoving the subscription service in your face. It's gross. The whole experience is tarnished by the constant ads. Please don't reward this nasty marketing behaviour by giving Ubisoft more money.\n"", '\n  Way too expensive for the fact there are Not that many free songs. The good songs you need to buy/ upgrade with a subscription that you pay monthly. If I knew this I would not have paid this much for this game. Very dissapointed\n', '\n  Absolutely love it. There’s only a certain number of free songs in it. Any other song it’s locked and you have to pay for it and get unlimited songs. There is a one month free trial that you can activate though to see if the songs are worth it. I bought it so my boys can keep entertained during the winter season. So far, they are having lots of fun, burning the calories and keeping entertained. Also it’s pretty engaging with single or dual players so parents do join in with your kids! They are bound to laugh like crazy!\n', '\n  Super Disappointed!\n', '\n  Just Dance 2021 is a fun game. The online tournaments are fun but it only scores one player. The new dances are fun. It’s kind of annoying that the start screen is trying to get you to sign up for a paid subscription. So many songs but most of them are subscription only. It’s annoying that searching for songs can be frustrating  because the subscription songs are Mixed together with the regular songs. It makes me so mad I play 2017 with my husband instead.\n']"

However, I do have some complaints. I am a noob and it took a lot of work, looking online, youtube videos, and going through the menus to try to figure out what the game was even about, how to win, etc.  It also does a pretty poor job of tutorials and the menus aren't very intuitive.  There are a lot of confusing mechanics and options in the menu and the translation to english in the tutorials seems like there is something lost in translation.

You might unlock 2 in 1 hour or play for 4 and unlock none.  Plus you have no control of who gets unlocked.  Excited to play as Snake or Bayonetta?  Good luck.  Literally.  Unlocking them is just random luck.  Kind of a shame for people that just want this as a party game and don't want to put in all the effort and time to unlock all the characters that were alluded to being available.

MUST BUY if you're a Smash Bros, Nintendo fan.\n"", ""\n  My preorder from another store came Thursday afternoon, so I've been playing with my kids for about eight hours. It totally lives up to expectations. It's in no way perfect, but there's just so much good that I don't see how anybody can be sad. It's a game I'm going to be playing for years, and I'm going to enjoy it for years. If you're a parent, your kids will love playing with all their friends. If you're a returning player, all the nostalgia and great Smash gameplay is here. If you're new to Smash, this is a great game to play with other people.When you first boot up, you'll have access to eight characters: Mario, DK, Link, Samus, Yoshi, Kirby, Starfox, and Pikachu. Unlocks happen pretty quick, but we'll see how long it takes to unlock all 74 characters. I love some of the new costumes like the Mario Wedding costume. I read an online unlock guide that said if you quit the game after unlocking a character and play another quick round that you'll unlock lots of characters quickly. When I say quit the game I mean to exit the game on the Switch home menu. That's worked well so I did that for a while on my Switch to unlock quickly so I could play with lots of characters. I didn't tell my kids about this because I want unlocking on their Switch to be more organic and slower.Lots of characters have pretty big differences in how they play and lots of characters have small differences and lots is the same. I don't even know what to tell you. Switching out pokemon with pokemon trainer is really fast. You can detonate Link's bombs remotely. The basic gameplay is the same so Smash fans will pick up on things really fast. I still think that Smash is the best game for fighting game beginners because the controls are very simple.Gameplay is faster than the past few games. This can make battles more crazy. The only complaint about faster gameplay is that it's harder to keep up with both your character and everything else that's happening on the board. I've lost my character a number of times. I almost wish we could get an option for colored outlines for all the characters. I might just be out of practice, so we'll see if this is still an issue after a while.Is it balanced? There are 74 characters--who knows! And since Smash for Wii U had balancing updates, this will be different in a year from now. I will say that the kids and I have fought with all sorts of characters and nobody's thought that any seemed overpowered. We're just barely starting to see the changes to characters and how new characters work and we're still unlocking characters. The Smash community will be finding things out for months and opinions are going to change over and over.I love that you can save rulesets. You can customize the game heavily with more or less stuff. You can have lots of items or no items or specific items or more lives or change the Final Smash options. It's really cool to have all your quick pick favorites but at the same time making rulesets is a little slow. I feel that as I get rulesets made that I'll really like it. Today being new, I've really wanted to make a tweak between games and it's been kinda slow because of all the options available. We are a two switch family and it's going to be a pain to make all our rulesets twice. I really wish there was some way to bring rulesets with you.I don't know how it could be done better, but the stage select is just one big picture of little tiny squares. It's almost too much. I wish there were an option to show you like 12 random stages rather than all of them. We've mostly played on random so far because it's overwhelming!The graphics and animation takes a step up from the Wii U more than I thought it would. The stage graphics are awesome and there are so many new touches that are really cool. The N64 stages feel updated but classic. It runs very smoothly in tv mode and we've not played in handheld mode.The music is awesome. There's just so much variety. It all sounds like it's made on a computer, but it's all really good music. I hear there are over 800 tracks...Controls feel great. The joycons aren't the perfect smash controller. The thumbsticks can't keep up with a good player. The pro controller is better, but the gamecube controller just feels right. Maybe I'm nostalgic, but I'm really enjoying playing with the gamecube adapter. My daughters prefer the joycon because that's really the controller they know. My 11 year old son also likes the gamecube controllers (but I guess he could be feeding of my choice). If you're really serious about the game, I really suggest your getting the gamecube adapter. Mine that came with Super Smash Bros Wii U works great, but I see they're selling it separate now. It sold out quite a few times in the Wii U era, so you might want to pick one up now!Local multiplayer is awesome. I think you can play with 8 players on every stage. We've had five people playing lots of battles and it's been a whole lot of fun. This is Smash Bros to us!We don't play online, so I'm just ignoring that. I'm sure lots of people will be talking about how crappy it is or laggy or great or amazing or horrible. We play with family, with friends, with church youth, and with anyone around a TV.World of light is the single player story mode. My first impression is that it's not as good as Sub-Space Emissary from Smash Brawl, but it looks like a decent way to play alone and unlock more stuff. Kinda like I don't play online, I don't play the story mode that much. My son is excited about it, so I'm glad it's here. I'll just let others who want story mode more review it better. Collecting spirits to affect your character and the stage seems really cool, but I hear that it just means that the uniqueness of the stages go away so all the stages seem the same. You will run into stages with fog. If you have a spirit badge that takes away fog, it just makes it another normal Smash battle. We'll see how fast it gets old for my son.They've said there will paid and free DLC. Piranha Plant will be free DLC for early adopters and will be available early next year. There will be 5 paid DLC packs that each has 1 new fighter, one new stage, and music tracks. The first one will be a Persona 5 character! They haven't announced any others yet. These packs will be six dollars each or 25 for the set. They haven't set a date for the DLC but they've said all 5 packs will be available by 2020. I assume one will come every few months.Overall, it's an awesome game. With the free Piranha Plant, you get 75 fighters to pick from. There are over 100 stages. There's just so much Smash. It plays great and it's a lot of fun. I totally suggest this!\n"", ""\n  Choosing for glory or for fun was crucial as it didnt force you to play with people who simply wanted to play the game casually online.Now we must set online preferences and hope we get an opponent with a similar set-up. Not only will you be in matches you didnt agree to be in, but they'll likely be free for all or 1v1 matches with ridiculous and different preferences each match......How does that make the online experience better for anyone?\n"", '\n  Me llegó una película en lugar del juego\n', '\n  De los mejores juegos a la fecha para el Nintendo Switch. No necesitas estar conectado  puedes jugar con los Joycons  del switch, aunque recomiendo usar (comprar) mejor un control Pro (original de Nintendo) o uno de Gamecube (+ el adaptador).Hay eventos semanales y contenido descargable como personajes y escenarios (con costo adicional).Simplemente el mejor Smash Bros de todos.\n', '\n  Es un gran juego, aunque me llegó un día después de lo esperado.\n', '\n  El juego es grandioso, pero daño la experiencia no disfrutarlo desde el dia de lanzamiento. Será muy dificil que vuelva a ordenar en preventa aquí. Busquen otras opciones más seguras, son muchas quejas de los clientes como para no tomarlo en cuenta.\n', '\n  El mejor Smash de la historia.Sin duda este smash es perfecto tiene el mayor contenido que ha existido, los mejores invitados y el mayor equilibrio que ha habido en toda laSaga.El juego corre a 1080p en modo TV y a 720p en Perfectos 60fps, y nada que ver con el Wii U el nivel grafico es perfecto pongan el de Wii U y pongan este y diran como puede haber vivido sin esto.Los peleadores todos han sido todos balanceados y cambiadas algunas de sus habilidades para que se sienta como juego nuevo.Por ejemplo.Mario cuando lanza la capa para regresar poderes ahora es un poco las lenta ya que estaba muy rota, link ya no usa su gancho para agarrar a los personajes los agarra con los brazos tipo Mario e igual sus bombas son activadas via remota como las de breath of the Wild.Con respecto a los Sticker son un monton necesitaras una vida para poder obtenerlos todos, y con respecto a la musica son 900 canciones Nintendo agarro la mejor seleccion de estas para que el juego sea un deleite a la hora de pelear, de hecho en las opciones de juego te permite poner las que suenen mas y cuales suenen menos en un escenario especifico y para aquellos que de verdad aman la musica de nintendo pueden agarrarlo como reproductor ya que la pantalla la puedes apagar y solo escuchar tu musica asi maximizas la bateria si lo que quieres es escuchar solo el soundtrack.El modo Online se juega muy bien no hay retraso al menos yo he jugado con amigos con conexion de 50mb y se juega muy bien, hay chat de Voz atravez de la app de Nintendo Switch.El modo aventura es muy largo no es tan tan entretenido es parecido al emisario sub espacial de Wii pero habra quienes lo aprecien en lo que a mi respecta no es mi modo preferido.En el juego comienzas con los 8 personajes del de Nintendo 64 y conforme jueges offline te van retando al azar son varios asi que tendremos que jugar muchas horas antes de completar el roster y jugar con nuestro personaje favorito.Hay muchos items nuevos al igual que asistentes sin duda es un juego 100% nuevo hay duda que Nintendo Cerro el año con este gran juego.\n']"
