There is an issue with the design though. I believe the manufacturer is assembling the inner infrastructure of the chair improperly. After about 6 months the back failed on me. I removed the leather and foam to inspect the issue. There are brackets that are attached to the wood with threaded nuts. This is a sufficient manner to connect the pieces however they have installed them opposite. Meaning the nuts are on the back and/or the bottom and the L brackets are on the top or front. Therefore when you sit or lean back all of the weight holding ability is bearing on the NUTS rather than on the brackets. I disassembled mine. I installed the L bracket under the base and the nuts on the top side. Likewise on the back I put the nuts on the front and the L bracket on the back. This increased the stability and durability of the chair 10 fold. Photos I uploaded show the nut that pulled through the wood and my repair by moving the bracket below.Now after about 11 months the chair is still working great. i find the leather material to be more durable than the office store type chairs. If the manufacturers would switch the process or contact me for more information on the chair engineering I could make this a 5 star review and a great value for a $100 chair.\n', ""\n  1. Bonded leather didn't last a year, the handles are peeling off as I sit in this chair.2. Squeaks like crazy, have to reapply some wd-40 every now and then.3. Foam cushion inserts are so-so.4. The button inserts and black plastic cover covering the screws on the side comes off periodically.TLDR; get something that doesn't have 'bonded leather' as the material, that and maybe something a bit more reputable.\n"", '\n  Here is why I am totally upset & disgusted with this ""office"" chair. First off,, the brown chair does NOT have a pewter colored finished -- it\'s more of a matte gold. That was the very first thing we noticed as we started unpacking the pieces. This turned out to be just the beginning of our troubles.Secondly, the screws for assembling the chair were too short. Whoever designed this should be doing something else for a living.  We still cannot get the screws to stay tight.  Basically, assembling this thing was a nightmare and we ended up needing THREE people to help finesse the parts into fitting together.Finally, after TWO hours of fighting to get the chair assembled, we stood back to look at our finished product and discovered a small tear in the back of the chair that we never noticed when we unpacked it.  Too late now.  Also, the chair\'s arms won\'t stay tight -- they keep loosening up because of the lousy construction design.  The chair is also uncomfortable because we\'re afraid to lean back in it or sit all the way against the back of it for fear of it falling apart. And finally, the little end caps, that are supposed to hide the screw heads, keep falling off because they weren\'t manufactured properly.It\'s too late now to send the chair back. Who wants the hassle of taking this one apart, packing it back up and sending it back? If I could leave this chair zero stars, I would. I\'m going to contact Amazon directly about all the issues we had with this product.  I would suggest you pass when it comes to buying this chair until you have read ALL the reviews and viewed the videos that upset buyers posted. I sure wish I had been more diligent before buying it.\n', '\n  \xa0Fabric (fake leather) does not hold up with normal use.  Mechanically, the chair is fine, but the fake leather is thinner than tissue paper and wears through very easily.  As you can see, this happened to six chairs...\n', '\n  The chair is very sturdy, but the issue is the cheap material used. From the pictures, you can see how the material has started to peel off. I purchased it March 2017. You get what you pay for because a good executive chair cost hundreds of dollars and not $110. Next time, I will buy a real leather chair because now I have to replace it.\n', '\n  I guess it is what a 100 dollar chair amounts to these days.  Disappointing. The bottom seat part broke where the arms attach to the back and there is no structure to the chair, you cannot lean back without it breaking even more. I reordered another chair in the hopes that it will not be as defective as the first but that was my only chance given the packaging was ruined during shipping and I will be reusing the second chairs box to return the first. I guess I will have the opportunity to do the same thang till I win the chair lottery. Wish me luck. Give this chair a HARD pass unless you are feeling lucky.\n', ""\n  Everything of this chair is already falling apartMy wife bought this for me in April. It's been making sounds like I had it 25 years.\n"", ""\n  Obviously this chair is fake leather, but it feels decent and the color hasn't changed yet. The paint on the plastics is ok, however some have already chipped off when the chair slightly rubbed against the wall. Its a decent chair for the price and I would be happy with it IF it didn't squeak. I am not just talking about a little every now and then, but EVERY time I move in the chair it squeaks. Very loud and aggravating. I have tried to find the exact point but couldn't. Also, any bass whatsoever from my sub below the desk causes the chair arm to shake. This is literally the noisiest chair I have ever sat in. If this thing didn't squeak, it would be 4 or 5 stars. The quality is justified with the price but the squeaking is ridiculous.*UPDATE*I almost never use this chair now. It is incredibly unconformable, and does not help keep proper posture at all. Even when I lock the recline, I always find myself leaning forward from the chair too far back and reclined. The squeak has gotten worse. I will never buy this chair again. Uncomfortable, loud, and doesn't help at all to keep a proper posture due to its design.\n"", '\n  I purchased this chair for my office, and after a month of regular use, the left side of the back of the chair decides to tear up. The faux leather does not hold up well at all and cannot stand regular use.I thought this would not be a problem since the chair is covered under a year of warranty which says - ""We warrant the Product to You against defects in materials and workmanship under ordinary consumer use for one year from the date of Your original retail purchase from Us""But when I ended up wanting to claim the warranty, the claim was dismissed saying that this was physical damage. Despite me letting them know over and over again that this is an office setup and the chair was just used ordinarily like any other chair would be, the customer support team got aggravated over their incompetence and closed the case.This has been a waste of money and time dealing with incompetent Cloudtail (AmazonBasics) customer support teams who do not honor their warranty.\n', ""\n  I bought this in Jan 2017.  Within two years,  the skin is peeling off and looks so ugly.  I never expected a product from Amazon will be of so bad quality.  Don't know what to do now after two years.  Hope Amazon will help to resolve it.\n"", '\n  As the chair is FIXED position except for height, and is fixed in a slightly leaned back position due to the shape and angle of the seat, it isn\'t really comfortable for working a keyboard.  It is designed as what I would call a ""manager\'s"" chair; nice for holding discussions or interviews, etc, or even just relaxing a bit.  ""Uncomfortable"" was mentioned in other reviews,and I suspect those reviewers were using it as a ""task"" chair.  I am too, but I still like it so I\'m keeping it even though it isn\'t ergonomically designed for that.It\'s quite heavy and the quality of the metalwork and upholstery looks and feel good.  At the price, I hope it lasts.It comes with a very detailed assembly manual which I didn\'t even open.  It goes together quite quickly,  smoothly and logically, if you\'ve ever assembled anything like it before.\n', '\n  I purchased Amazon Basics Full Back Executive Chair on17th April 2017.  After Using for two and half years, the present condition is shown in photos. Seat thin layers are comming out. On hand rest also layers is comming out.  It looks very much ugly.I rarely  use this chair, still this is the condition. Kindly do somthing, so that I will have  good opinion on Amazon. Expecting a positive replay from your side. I am a retired Air Force Officer. Thank you.\n', ""\n  I am writing this review to clear some misconceptions regarding this chair which are raised by some of the customers. Firstly this chair is very easy to assemble but would require two persons to do the job. Secondly this chair has a proper 'TILT function and I am surprised that many reviewers have wrongly pointed out that this chair can't be tilted.The procedure to activate tilt function is clearly mentioned in the booklet. All you have to do is to clockwise rotate the round knob underneath the seat and then pull the lever outwards to adjust the tilt function. After setting the desired tilt level you can easily enjoy the rocking motion on this chair. Thirdly this chair is extremely comfortable and sturdy despite the lower portion being made fibre/plastic material. Fourthly the wheels remain stable and steady when you sit on the chair and there is no skidding. Finally I think this chair is good value for money and I recommend it wholeheartedly.\n""]"

Good lumbar support.  Does not raise up very high but I am short so that is ok.  The cushion is definitely the worst part though.  I have only had it a couple of days and I am already researching additional chair pads.  You basically feel like you are sitting on a hard piece of cardboard.  For the price, it is an ok chair.\n', '\n  Bought this chair for our children who is doing remote learning in his room. And this is definitely it! It is really easy to set up. Definitely the right size for his small study table. The wheels are sturdy and moves smoothly. Most importantly, the arm rest can be adjusted so that we can adjust it to the figure of our kid who is growing fast. I tried to sit on it for a while. The back support also provides just the right amount of support —- no head support though since the back panel is not very tall. It may not look “expensive “ comparing to the leather kind, but the fabric makes it more breathable. We are keeping it for sure.\n', '\n  Edit on Jan 22, 2021: I have now been using the chair for a few months, and it continues to be super comfortable.Original review:Easy assembly: took me 30 minutes to assemble this chair all by myself with zero help, by only using the instructions and the tools provided in the box.Comfortable: I have only been using the chair for the last half an hour but have found it extremely comfortable so far. I love that the back is straight (most office chairs I have tried have a slightly backward sloping back) and so it supports my back very well. This chair also goes pretty low, which is also good for a shorter/petit person like me.Value: I think it is very reasonably priced for my work from home set up.\n', '\n  This is awful. I researched for months for a chair and finally decided on this one. I received it with a missing gas lift and screws.**update** almost a month later I finally received my missing parts. The chair is very easy to put together and is very comfortable. Their customer service is great-just took forever to get my missing pieces.\n', '\n  This chair is exactly what I was looking for. It is affordable comfortable and has the ability to raise and lower the armrest as well as adjust the height and adjust the angle of the back. Absolutely perfect!\n', '\n  Terrible product and nowhere near worth the price tag.  Did not come with building instructions, materials are cheap plastic and highly uncomfortable.  After less than one month of using I can no longer use it.  The cushion has worn out and I can legitimately feel screws/bolts stabbing my buns every time I sit on it.  Don’t buy and waste your hard earned money.  There are way better products out there at similar price points.\n', '\n  I found this office chair pretty easy to install. It only took me within 15 min to finish the installment. I used to own an office chair with leather wrapped on the handle, which is really annoying because the leather tends to peeling over time. Fortunately I found this one, really flexible to move on the wheels and firm enough. Overall after getting is for over 2 weeks I am satisfied with this new chair.\n', '\n  This is a chair I use at a writing desk but I don’t spend all day sitting in it. It is comfortable enough for my needs. I enjoyed putting it together because the instructions were easy bro understand. The price was right for what I got.\n']"

Received quickly enough. Simple to assemble. Reclines ok (but like any chair other than premium, care is warranted). Flip up arm rests are a nice bonus. Molded plastic pieces (arm rests, legs) have a seam from the mold that can be a bit sharp, so care when handling is good idea and may need a bit of sanding down if in a location that could be problematic like at the end of the arm rest where you would grab. Max height is not as high as I would like. Overall though, solid purchase.\n', ""\n  The chair comes well packaged in pieces you need to assemble with screws and the supplied allen wrench.  The wheels require a lot of force in insert into the legs, and you have to bend the plastic a bit to get all the pieces to fit together correctly.

I find it to be very helpful to have a chair where the height can be adjusted.  After 4 days of using the chair at a proper height my mouse hand feels better.  Features I like about the chair the seat is very comfortable, swivels and moves just fine.  Enough adjustments to make the chair comfortable at multiple heights.  The only thing the chair is lacking is an adjustment for the lumbar support.

The chair has an overall slim appearance as well as a light weight compare to some rather bulky leather office chairs. We like the design of the mesh like back which is quite comfortable and help reduce the stress when sitting for longer hours. Height adjustment is easy by operating the level bar on the right hand side just below the seat.\n', '\n  I\'ve only used this for a couple weeks.

I stayed in it on purpose to see if it stood up to the test of time. The support only lasts a few hours then I grabbed a pillow. The seat part became uncomfortable after about 5 hours.

I will update in a few weeks.\n', ""\n  I normally don't write reviews, but I had to put one for this one. Everything is great. I like how the back support feels when I sit on it. However, I had extremely difficult time assembling it. I am not old or anything but I felt that the wheels were bit hard to force into the holes. Also, the step that pissed me off was the armrest: the part that connects to surface underneath the seat. The holes where screws had to go into were completely off; I had to use extreme force to align the armrest with the hole and put the screw into 1 of the 2 holes. I could not put in the other screw at all. It still works fine with just one screw each side, but this whole process threw me off. They should fix this before it bothers any more people.\n"", '\n  Bought this chair for my lady. She’s petite, and this chair is on the smaller side.

The moment I sat in it, I was instantly relieved of any doubt or speculation that it wouldn't be of long-term use for me.The seat itself, which you can see in the pics, is large, plush, and incredibly comfortable to sit on!

Our intended main user of this chair is 5\'10"", 215 lbs, and his thighs press against the armrests. It cannot be assembled sans armrests as they structurally support the back.The lumbar supports are good but low, being most pronounced at 3"" to 5"" above the seat, and make contact at the top of the hips if you try to sit back in the seat. The seatback slopes rearwards and makes basically no contact with you at points above the lumbar area unless you arch way back.The seat is firm and not very thick, and the recline tension can be increased just enough for a person of this weight. Recline can be locked only in the full upright position, and even when locked the chair still rocks back an inch or so.Seat height adjusts from about 17.5"" to about 21"". Materials overall are attractive; arms and back frame are a matte textured plastic which feels like it\'ll scratch easy. The fabric is a medium red that\'s bright without being garish.Assembly is easy if you pay attention to the three different screw lengths and make sure to use each one where it\'s called for.Overall an attractive lightweight office chair probably quite suitable for a smaller person. Not a chair for wide-bottomed manspreaders. Should not be represented as especially ergonomic or larger than average.\n', '\n  i liked everything. we use it at our computer\n', '\n  Deben tener cuidado en el empacado. Llegaron los brazos ligeramente lastimados y muy empolvado.\n', '\n  Have not had long  but seems to work great.\n', '\n  Home Office Chair\n']"
