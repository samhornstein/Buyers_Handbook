However, I have never understood why the more expensive smart watches and fitness trackers do not offer BP and blood oxygen level measurement options also.I bought a set of ankle bands for my Fitbit and wear it there now (and get MUCH more accurate step counts than when wearing it on my wrist) and began a search for an affordable smart watch that measures BP and O2 levels.Over the past six months, I have bought and tried out six different BP smart watches from Amazon and returned four of them because of their extremely inaccurate algorithms used to calculate BP. The worst one was always at least 16 mmHg off systolically and 8-10 mmHg off diastolically. Also, the accompanying apps were nothing to write home about.I had just about given up when I found this watch, decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did! This is hands down THE most comfortable watch of any kind I have ever had on my wrist! It's very lightweight and the band is so soft and pliable I  forget I even have it on! I love the style and for once, the BP readings are well within the ballpark of what my actual cuff monitor shows. I don't have an actual oxygen sat reader, but when I compared my result with the reading I got when I visited my physician's office and, it was only off by 1%.The mobile app which accompanies this watch, HeroBand III, it's also commendable. It paired easily with my Galaxy Note 10+ and offers a wealth of information that's easily understandable. I think it compares quite favorably to the Fitbit app regarding stat breakdowns.The notification feature works perfectly with my texting program and offers a list of other apps to connect to. The one that is missing that I use regularly is FB Messenger. I hope it will be added in a future software update. The weather function and exercise timer work great, too!Battery life on the watch is excellent. I last charged it on Tuesday morning, and two days later, the battery indicator shows there is a 90% charge left. I don't sleep with my watch on, and turn it off when I remove it for the evening, which could be one reason why it's just sipping it's battery charge.The only measurement that is off is the step counter. It is returning results of about 40% lower than what my Fitbit on my ankle says. I think this is just because it's worn on the wrist, so I don't really pay attention to that feature.This is easily the best economy smart watch I've used to date. I like it so much, I have ordered a second one as a backup in case the current one ever fails or if this model is ever discontinued.\n"", '\n  This smart watch is amazing, I have recently found out I have high blood pressure and have been taking my medicine for over a month every time I visit a store with the blood pressure machines I’ve been checking it , since I’ve ordered my watch I can use it to check my blood pressure anywhere I go, it’s so awesome and convenient having it at the touch of a button, wasn’t skeptical on how it would work but it’s perfect so glad I got it, definitely recommend this watch!\n', '\n  Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2020Color: BlackVerified PurchaseThis is a fantastic smart watch fitness tracker for the low cost.

Everything works great hooks up with your iphone health app no problem.  It is water proof, have yet to see any condensation in the watch.

It’s also not $300...I had to give this thing a decent amount of time.  Buckle up:  out of the box, it comes with three amazing faces.  It’s not an Apple watch.I can make fun of this watch, but after giving it some time - it’s a really good watch for the price.  It tracks heart rate and sleep time.  It can get the O2 content.  It monitors my heart rate.  It reminds me that i am being lazy.  It tracks my steps.  It receives my Arlo notifications every time a squirrel runs in front of the cameras.Today i setup a fitness tracking and chose the activity i was doing and it monitored my heart rate and provided my calorie burn.It probably does other stuff, but I haven’t figured out everything yet.  It is better than my Fitbit.  There is an app that syncs to my phone that reminds me daily of the pitiful shape i am in.  The battery life is amazing.  The touch screen is responsive.  The app is ok.It’s $40!  I genuinely love this product for what it is.  I think iwatches are dumb and overpriced, but this is worth every penny.I would recommend this watch to anyone.  I am very happy with this purchase!\n', ""\n  This is the first smart watch that I found that has given me a fairly accurate pulse ox reading. This has been especially helpful for work as I've been able to put it on different patients as were doing activities. When measuring pulse ox it does require that the person stay relatively still which can be somewhat challenging if I'm trying to get a reading as they're up and moving. I like that it has gentle vibrations to let you know with the alerts. This has been really nice when we're trying to do a timed activity and I can set the stopwatch or timer for countdown and easily let people know when they should start and stop an activity. The touchscreen works really well and I have the watch paired to my phone so I can easily monitor how my patients are doing. The watch itself is fairly light weight and I like that I can use it in order to check someone's vitals by the second hand on the display. Very clear readings very clear display overall it's been a win for me.\n"", '\n  This smart watch is comfortable to wear and fits tight on my wrist. Setup was simple and easy to get it up and running. The app is fantastic and easy to use pairing with the app was so simple.  The watch face is clear and easy to read.  The touch screen works well.  The watch seems to be very accurate and it does a good job of calculating my health stats while working out.  I am happy with this watch it was a great value.\n', ""\n  Love the user interface of this. It is so simple to operate both from the watch and my cell. It tracks everything and keeps me alerted to my needs or when I've been sitting for too long during the day. There's a few different watch modes to choose from but they all look very sleek and professional. I have not had to charge it yet so the battery life is super long.  It fits my wrist nicely and secure without cutting off my circulation\n"", ""\n  This is overall a really great watch and has a lot of useful functions. The number of steps that it tracks is pretty accurate in comparison to the number of steps shown on my iPhone health app.The touch screen is easy to navigate and the app is very useful to look at the watch's data that it collects (see image attached). Some of my other favorite functions include being able to control your music, oxygen level checking, calories burned, and heart rate tracking throughout the day.The watch's battery also charges very quickly (less than 30 minutes) and the battery life also lasts a long time. The watch's size is similar to an Apple watch and lighter than an Apple Watch.Overall it's a great price for all of its functions and very practical. I definitely recommend this product.\n"", ""\n  And I like it pretty much. We walk in the morning and this morning I used it with the GPS on and sadly, there's no way to stop the training session without turning off the GPS.  I was at home sitting on my butt for thirty minutes before I figured that out. And while it was in the training session, I had zero access to the other watch functions.If I'm doing something wrong, please, please, please! tell me how to do it correctly.Other than that, I like it. Nice to know why I'm so tired every day. I sleep like crap.And life is good.\n"", ""\n  My Wife loves it! I got it for her and since she got it, it has not left her hand. Comes in a nice packaging. Love the look and feel of this watch, feels ver premium and not cheap and does most of the stuff you would expect it to do, like show your notifications and who's calling you, you can also play your music on your phone from the watch. It has a long life battery, definitely can't complain about the battery life. If i had to Nitpick something about it, it would only be that the icons could look a bit better, but like i said, that's just me nitpicking, but for the most, i really find the watch offers more than what you're paying for it. So you'll definitely love it.\n"", '\n  This is my first fitness watch. It seems lightweight and fairly comfortable. I’m not a fan of the silicone band that these types of watches have.  But most fitness/smart watches come with them. The integration with the app works well. I’m disappointed with the battery life. Maybe I’m just not comfortable to let it get much below 40%. It seems to go about 4 days to get down to 40%. The charging cable is easy to use as it’s magnetic. The price is definitely attractive.\n']"

But I decided to slurge a little bit...... The only think that kept me from switching was that I had to charge the watch so much more. I originally had the Fitbit charge 2...... then I purchased the series 3 (42mm) and I love this watch but it was just far too big. So I am returning the 42mm and just received the 38mm and am much happier with the size. I wanted to really share the size difference. I love this watch so far... will review in the future.\n', ""\n  Why do people love their Apple Watches? It's just a watch, for pete's sake! But if you have one you know right away. There's a small miracle that happens in a busy life when you can answer your phone (er, watch?) with your hands full. Or just glancing down to see the text message you just got. Or even completing those freaking rings (don't know? of you will). There's very little bad I can say after having my Series 2 for the last couple of years. I'm happy to get the 3 to have the always-on feature of cellular. I can leave the house and it's not even a problem if I left my phone. Or go for a walk without having a heavy phone in my pocket. It's not even about style, there's just a huge practicality of having a small device attached to your wrist that makes so many problems go away. Here are the positives:• Excellent watch. Like, as a watch.• Receive calls. Make calls.• Receive text messages. Facebook, Twitter, IG, and more.• Interchangeable bands. Fit the look you want, change on a dime.• Siri• Alarms, notes and all the other little apps.• Fitness trackingReally, I don't have any cons. I know people think a smart phone in your back pocket is the top, but this just changes the game. I don't know a single person who ever got an Apple Watch and didn't like it. And the funny thing is you'll never know unless you get one - Because how it changes what you do is the thing that makes it amazing. It's all those small little ways that make for a stupidly brilliant product.Seriously, you, your wife, your boyfriend - It make a perfect gift.\n"", '\n  I love this watch! I upgraded from a series 1. It runs so smooth and flawlessly compared to series 1. It feels like what the Apple Watch was meant to be. The ability for Siri to talk back is refreshing. The ability to see HTML emails is a huge plus as well. And finally the fact that it is waterproof seals the deal.\n', ""\n  I like the Apple Watch Series 3. After trying it out for a few days I realized a few things: I don't wear watches often enough to justify the cost; You'll likely need to charge it daily; It's great for those who already wear watches everyday and can remember to charge it at night; You'll still use your iPhone to handle most tasks. If you want something only for fitness and/or sleep tracking buy a FitBit.\n"", '\n  First off... I don’t write reviews, but WOW! was I impressed with this product. This series 3 watch 42mm GPS came brand new. The box was still seal and the protective plastic on the watch was still on the watch. I bought this for my nephew for his Birthday and was worry that when he opened the box their was going to be things missing I took a risk and I’m glad I did. Thanks to this seller and would definitely buy again. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!\n', '\n  Thought the 42mm was going to be too big with my small wrist. It ended up looking great and got here earlier than expected\n', '\n  Upgraded from a Series 1 to this Series 3.  I can\'t believe the difference in speed!  That alone made the upgrade absolutely worth it!  The move between apps and the messages app are smooth and succinct.  The added features that my old watch did not have are intuitive and time-saving: the raise to talk Siri is perfect and works flawlessly.  Not having to ""call out"" to Siri is great.  The walkie-talkie feature is a tad clumsy, but works well for a quick check-in to/from my wife while I am at work.  The kids have enjoyed it too when they miss me during the longer days.  While I have not swam with the watch, I have worn it in the shower a handful of times.  The water eject button is quite intelligent.  I think it simply uses sounds waves to push the water out of the speaker port.  You can hear a ""wshhh"" sound, hearing its effectiveness.  I will say though, the pitch/volume of the eject noise is quite loud...people WILL look!Like many others, I was hesitating between the new Series 4 and this Series 3.  I got it for $229 for Black Friday and simply could not pass up that deal at nearly HALF off a new 4.  I don\'t regret it one bit and am glad I took the plunge!\n', '\n  I ordered this watch this morning and it arrived 6 hours later.

I’ve had a series 3 before, have played around with a series 6, and the SE is the best bang for your buck hands down.The series 3, even the 38mm one, looks and feels a bit bulky and doesn’t have as many features as this one. The series 6 has a few more features (literally like 3 or 4 that most people don’t even use or notice), but for the average person who wants an Apple Watch for working out and convenience, this is perfect. It lays flatter than the series 3 which is nice bc the 3 was a bit uncomfortable. Love it!\n', '\n  I’ve been wanting an apple watch for some time now and finally decided to treat myself. Definitely satisfied with the quality & price. My roommate bought the series 5 almost a year ago for almost $400 and the SE basically has all the same features, for a cheaper price. So happy with my purchase!\n', '\n  Exactly as expected! I had a series 2 watch that wouldn’t hold a charge longer than half a day! Upgraded to this SE and so far so good!Nice sleek design. I added a glass screen protector and a cover to protect the watch.\n', '\n  Okay so this is my second Apple Watch, I upgraded from the series 2. The watch looks beautiful as always. For the price, I had to go with this vs the series 6. If you can live without the always on display and the blood oxygen sensor then I recommend this watch! Also aftermarket watch bands are abundant on Amazon so you can add your own style!\n', '\n  After smashing the screen of my 6 month old Apple Watch 5 and downloading an update that left the watch useless, I decided I had to replace the darn thing. The SE is so enticing with its low(er) price point and all the basic features I wanted. Rather than forking over $200 to replace a cracked screen, I decided to go ahead and buy a completely new watch.I received the watch yesterday with Amazon Prime’s fantastic delivery service. The packing came as expected, in perfect condition. I turned the watch on and went through the set up process only having a minor heart attack when it wouldn’t turn back on after updating. The watch was ready for use within 30 minutes and I couldn’t have been happier. I wore the watch for the remainder of the day with no issues and even did a workout! Man did I miss that little thing. At the end of the day it was time for us to go to sleep so I set it on the charger bed and turned the lights out.The next day I couldn’t wait to put it on and track my activity but to my dismay, it wouldn’t turn on. Nothing worked. It was properly sitting on the charger all night so there was just no excuse for the battery to be dead already. I attempted pressing the power button, pressing the power button and crown, setting it on the charger, and even tapping on the screen several times hoping it would magically wake up. I reached out to Apple support and they also did not have any new solutions for me. My Apple Watch, less than 24 hours in my possession, is now, what I presume to be, dead.What’s odd is that even though the screen did not turn on my phone could still detect the battery percentage, which was dropping at a rapid rate, about 10% every couple minutes. I just cannot understand what I did wrong! When things go wrong with my tech where else do I turn to other than the one and only Twitter.Reliable sources (Reddit) say there have been 9 reported cases of 40 mm Apple Watch SE users in South Korea experiencing burns from their Apple watches and a splotch developing on the upper right hand corner of the screen. These descriptions seemed to fit my situation, at least it’s the closest I could find. Although I did not get burned, the watch was pretty hot when I took it off the charger and there is some slight discoloration in the corner by the crown.Now I love the Apple Watch. Had this device decided to work I would’ve probably not rated it at all because of course it deserves 5 stars. I actually give it 3 stars because of the delivery person being awesome and my positive experience with its predecessor. So I warn you all before purchasing this SE, maybe wait a little bit. Wait a little to see if these issues resolve or end up in a recall. It’ll save you a trip to UPS to return like I’ll be doing this weekend.\n', '\n  General: this is my first time using and owning an Apple Watch. So in comparing the 6 and SE I decided the SE had more than enough features for me. Since I’ve never had an Apple Watch I wasn’t going to miss the “always on” feature everyone raves about on the 5 and 6.I opted for the 40 in Gold. I was concerned it was gonna too bulky. But I’m pleasantly surprised that it feels natural on. The Gold however is a rose gold with a pink hint. Not a true gold.Plus... hello the price was amazeballs!Fitness: I’m a former Fitbit user. So switching from Fitbit software and tracking to Apple Fitness was a change. After using for almost a week I can say I appreciate the customization of Fitness.It’s doing a great job at making me get off my booty. I do loving closing it my rings. Makes it feel like a game that I MUST win!!Battery: I’m using this a few times a day on cellular mode. I text, take calls through my AirPods and listening to streaming music while walking the dogs several times a day. I’m typically up between 5-6 am and in bed by 11 pm. At the end of the day I’m at less than 50% charge.While I wish I would last more than a day in a charge I feel like I’m using it a lot throughout the day and it does charge pretty dang fast.I’m very happy with my purchase thus far. Now I know what all the hype is about and I’m fully on the Apple Watch train!\n', '\n  For what I needed this watch was perfect. Think the additional stuff in the 6 is a bit gimmicky so I’m glad they have this “budget” watch available with the same chip. It’s smooth and fast and everything just works.

I chose GPS version and use it with iPhone XR to receive and place calls, make or read messages and so much more. While used in conjunction with Health and Loseit! apps, I'm gently reminded to exercise and easily track how well I'm eating and exercising.

Because I viewed them as geeky, or just not a classic automatic watch. I was walking on the roof last week at work, I got a call, pulled the phone out, and proceeded to drop it and it slid onto a paver. Oddly enough the phone is ok. So this watch enables me to leave my phone in my pocket. Well worth the money!  I also never liked that they turn off and they were way to small for my liking. The bigger face is nice yet not to big! I like the color, not a big fan of the red band so I ordered another one.  If you have never had or wanted an Apple Watch they are much better then the 1st one. I’m sure I’ll like it more as I truly get to understand all of the features.  I got the 6 instead of the se because of the health apps as well as it being more future proof inside.Thank you for reading sorry for rambling on.\n', '\n  Here’s an update on my Apple Watch series 6. To day I am returning it. I tried to be a watch person but it’s just not me. I wore it for 2 days and then the rest of the days it was just sitting on my dresser. It seemed like a chore to put it on all day. Also I had wanted the loop band when I purchased it but they wanted to charge me an extra hundred dollars. Also I was expecting it to be more entertaining but the health alerts were boring and they came at the worst times. I found myself dismissing the alerts rather than following them. Also the OS is not very good. The best things that I liked about the watch to were the charging times and the ECG and that’s it. The pros were not enough for me to justify the $462 that I spent on this watch.\n', '\n  I purchased this hoping that it would help me stay healthy. Unfortunately I found out I can’t use it because I have an old iPhone 6 phone. Because Apple continues to make their products obsolete after a few upgrades, I’m out several hundred bucks because I can’t go out and buy another newer IPhone.\n', '\n  I’ve been an Apple user my whole life. I think my father would roll over in his grave if he knew how much I loathed this product. I’ve never been able to bring myself to pay over $400 for a watch, so I’ve always had a Fitbit. Well, I splurged on this one for myself and my husband since it had new “upgrades” (that were already available with my Ionic). I’ve been wearing it for about a week now and I have to say I’m completely disappointed. The sleep tracking is garbage. It tracks my workouts ok, but seriously why is Standing an important metric? The battery is even worse!! I was able to wear my Ionic for at least six days between charges. You literally have to charge this thing everyday and it takes almost 4 hours to charge after running it down to 2%. Returning this ASAP and getting the new Fitbit Sense. Apple has a lonnnnnggggg way to go to catch up to Fitbit in my opinion. So until they can beef up everything that’s under the hood and be game changers like they are for all my other devices, I won’t be supporting the Apple Watch.\n', '\n  \xa0I did not receive the Apple Watch only band and charger and everything open :(\n', '\n  With absolutely every feature turned off the battery is lasting about 4 hours.

Produto exatamente como na descrição! Original, lacrado, perfeito! Entrega super rápida,realizada um dia após a compra!\n', '\n  Produto Original!!Muito lindo!\n', '\n  O produto é excelente e é consideravelmente superior aos demais smartwatches do mercado, seja em termos de acabamento, funcionalidades, design, capacidade de processamento etc. É o único smartwatch, por exemplo, que é realmente à prova d’água e não apenas resistente à água (pelo menos até o momento desta avaliação). É só ativar a função de bloqueio aquático que o usuário pode mergulhar na piscina, no mar ou onde queira, sem preocupações sobre prejuízos ao aparelho. Para acompanhamento de treinos de natação, por exemplo, é ótimo - detecta até o estilo do nado automaticamente -, de modo que nenhum outro aparelho oferece essa comodidade com efetiva segurança.Para os praticantes de atividades físicas o aparelho é excepcional, sendo o campo onde efetivamente se destaca. As funcionalidades relacionadas a saúde são excelentes e muitas delas emitem lembretes regulares para que coloquemos em prática pequenas ações, como ficar em pé, nos movimentar, respirar de forma concentrada etc. Embora algumas dessas funcionalidades também estejam presentes em outros aparelhos, no Apple Watch sua capacidade de personalização e controle é superior.Embora o design do Apple Watch seja o mais copiado do mercado, há outros com desenho mais chamativo, como é o caso do ZenWatch, por exemplo, que casa muito bem um design moderno com social. No entanto, sem sombra de dúvidas, o design é também um ponto forte do produto, apesar de inexistir diferença entre o Series 6 e os anteriores.Minha única crítica é quanto à dimensão do aparelho, que mesmo o de 44 mm para uma pessoa grande e um pouco mais atlética (tenho 1,90 m), não fica tão proporcional, mas nada que prejudique a avaliação. Se tivesse de 46-48 mm, acredito que seria o ideal. A bateria poderia ser um pouco mais durável também, já que sua autonomia, em média, é de 2 dias.Em síntese, é um luxo desnecessário - sobretudo pelo preço -, mas consideravelmente útil!\n']"

I wouldn’t take the time to write a review if this watch didn’t just blow my mind! I got this watch for my husband for Christmas and got myself a brand new Fitbit Versa 2 for four times the price. Before you start judging me for buying myself the better gift, I wasn’t sure if my husband was going to like a smart watch so I proceeded cautiously when purchasing one.We both open our gifts at Christmas and he liked the watch and we got it all set up on military time and set up the app on his phone to be able to manage the watch. I set up my Fitbit watch and it was almost the same process, and almost the same look and feel when navigating around. Seriously! I paid close to $200 for my Fitbit watch and my husband’s was under $50, and they pretty much do the same basic things. The only difference I can really tell is the extras, such as the ability to download a variety fun watch faces, access to purchase the Fitbit premium service, and a few other things that I doubt I will even use.Long story short, buy this watch and save your hard earned money for something else. It lives up to the 5 stars ⭐️\n', '\n  \xa0Always wanted a watch that you could see full text messages on etc.  This works awesome!  Sometimes my finger doesn’t work the swiping very well but it gets there LOL.  I also am able to set alarms on it via the app, VeryFitPro, that correlates to the alarms on my phone. So now when my phone alarm goes off, I get the same alarm alert on my watch. It will show a pill for medication alarm which lets me know it’s time for my meds. This is awesome bc I don’t always have my phone on my person.  The HEART RATE MONITOR works AMAZING!  Love this function as it is matching my monitor.  The music control will play whatever music was last played on your phone. You can’t see the song list on watch but can start, stop, and pause plus skip. Handy feature.Worth the money!\n', '\n  \xa0I have tried numerous fitness trackers for quite some time now and this one is absolutely fantastic for the cost.It arrived fully charged.  The app was easily downloaded and pairing was pretty much automatic.  I love that it is waterproof for swimming (IP68) and actually utilizing the functions of the watch are simple and easy to learn.First thing, the watch face is easy to read.  I\'ve had numerous trackers with the display text so small it was impossible to read.  You can even see the display outdoors in bright conditions.2nd, the instruction manual is readable, too without a magnifying glass lol...and it\'s been written in full & complete English sentences.  The packaging is also handsome & the tracker comes in different colors.3rd, the watch band is so cool!  Instructions are provided for band removal and any traditional watchband in the appropriate width can by purchased for the unit.  It is also very secure with the band supplied.  I have lost a few trackers walking because the bands were trash and did not secure the tracker correctly to my wrist.4th, the applications work great and are easily customized to your individual specs via the app you bind the tracker to.  The button on the side of the watch allows you to scroll through to the unit you want to measure and the touch screen is responsive even though it is a bit sensitive and it can be easy to scroll too far.  Just pushing the button will take you back to whatever screen you want.I will update my review after I have utilized the tracker for a couple weeks.  Also, it comes with a full 1 year warranty which is important since a lot of economical trackers tend to die within a few months if not sooner.  Hopefully I\'ll get tons of good use from this one.All in all, I highly recommend and it would be a great gift, too!6/23/2020 UpdateI\'m still in love with this watch.  It has not failed me yet, no glitches.  I charge it for about 1/2 hr a day just to ""top off"" the charge.  I\'m positive this watch could go a full week and still have charge.  I seriously do not take this watch off unless I\'m in the hot shower.  It\'s the perfect and simple tracker for those who are on a budget, have never had one, had trash trackers, or those who are electronically challenged.  It is also perfect for elderly because it might encourage activity and good sleep...yes it tracks sleep but you have to wear it. Eww.  Anyway, nuff said.  Get this watch. ✌❤\n', ""\n  I am very impressed with this watch/fitness tracker. I have had a few fitbits that have died on me. I wanted to try something different.This watches battery life is amazing. Im not sure if you can see well in the pictures or not. I charged this up on Tuesday last week. Today is Wednesday. It is at 48% battery life remaining. I am blown away with that.It has find your phone feature. Which is really cool if you are like me and have kids that walk off with your phone. Just push the button on the watch. They will come running out with your phone! 😉The ease of the app is awesome. And pairing it was a very simple process.The only thing I warn and it is absolutely not a problem. Is this watch is called green in color. It's more of a tealish blue. Again not an issue. Just look at the pictures. The 'green' is pretty true to color of photo.The size is pretty awesome too. My 4 year old wanted to wear it for a few minutes. Fit him. Fits me. And i even had a friend try it on. Fit him too.Definately would recommend and repurchase this. Wish I hadnt wasted money on fitbits before!$$\n"", '\n  This is a fantastic smart watch fitness tracker for the low cost. But to start it needs mobile apps (VeryFitPro) which is easy to download and setup via QR code.It’s looks and finish is cool 😎  and look like Apple Watch.After use of a week it’s BATTERY 🔋 life is very impressive which stands for long and quickly charged.It has different mode Sports, Alarm, Relax and Heartrate. It help to track heartbeat and relax your breath by doing inhale and exhale.Now it is easy and I can  track my steps and calories on daily basis & weekly.My son (4.5yrs) try it and it fits and works for him as well.

The display is always highly visible, even in bright sunlight .I have been wearing a wilful watch (exactly the same model) for about 2 months now and it has always functioned flawlessly.

It monitors my heart rate.  It reminds me that i am being lazy.  It tracks my steps.  It receives my Arlo notifications every time a squirrel runs in front of the cameras.Today i setup a fitness tracking and chose the activity i was doing and it monitored my heart rate and provided my calorie burn.It probably does other stuff, but I haven’t figured out everything yet.

This has been especially helpful for work as I've been able to put it on different patients as were doing activities. When measuring pulse ox it does require that the person stay relatively still which can be somewhat challenging if I'm trying to get a reading as they're up and moving. I like that it has gentle vibrations to let you know with the alerts. This has been really nice when we're trying to do a timed activity and I can set the stopwatch or timer for countdown and easily let people know when they should start and stop an activity. The touchscreen works really well and I have the watch paired to my phone so I can easily monitor how my patients are doing.

Some of my other favorite functions include being able to control your music, oxygen level checking, calories burned, and heart rate tracking throughout the day.The watch's battery also charges very quickly (less than 30 minutes) and the battery life also lasts a long time.

And while it was in the training session, I had zero access to the other watch functions.If I'm doing something wrong, please, please, please! tell me how to do it correctly.Other than that, I like it.

It seems to go about 4 days to get down to 40%. The charging cable is easy to use as it’s magnetic. The price is definitely attractive.\n']"
