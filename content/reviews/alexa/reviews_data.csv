The Show 10 is now attached to a swivel base that lets the Show 10 constantly rotate to face you as you move around the room.  Other changes include:  a new speaker configuration, MUCH better camera, better processor, and Amazon Sidewalk support.  Here are my thoughts so far:THE GOOD:-SETUP – Setup was super easy.  The Show came configured to my account, I didn't have to log in or even enter wifi passwords.  It connected, downloaded some updates, and then walked me through customizing the range of motion.-MOTION- This is the most obvious new improvement.  The Show 10 will now track your movement and turn to face you as you move around the room.  The Show seems to have very good facial tracking, and it will rotate on its horizontal axis to follow you (you can also manually tilt the screen up and down to your desired vertical position.)  We tested this while playing movies and while viewing our remote cameras, and it worked perfectly.  We also tested with multiple people in the room; and the Show seems to lock onto one face and moves to follow that face, until it can't see that face anymore and will move to another face.  Or if someone uses the Wake Word “Alexa,” it will turn toward where that voice was coming from.  This also works for video calls, though we noticed that on video calls the Show will rotate to try to keep ALL of our faces in view.  Sometimes this might mean it faces in between two people so that the camera can see both of us, and then automatically zooms the camera in or out to adjust.  Which brings me to the next big improvement:-13MP CAMERA – We were very impressed with the quality of the new camera, and with the tracking technology it uses.  Not only are images crisp and detailed on video calls, but the camera will actually automatically zoom in and out to adjust to the people in the shot.  For example I can back up from my kitchen into the living room, and the camera will zoom in and follow me.  When you combine this with the movement and facial tracking, it is almost like having your own camera man follow you around the room on your call.  The family members we called said they could see so much more detail.  There is also now a physical shutter that you can close to cover the camera if you want to.-SPEAKERS – The old 2nd Gen Show 10 had dual 2” neodymium drivers, but this new 3rd Gen Show 10 has two 1” tweeters and a 3” woofer.  I can definitely tell the difference, although I really don't use the Show for listening to music very often.  In testing out a few songs, I noticed that the new 3rd Gen seems louder at max volume, and less muffled.  Definitely an improvement, though maybe not quite on the level of the Echo Studio.-PROCESSOR – The new Show 10 has both an upgraded main processor, and also a second Amazon AZ1 processor.  This should result in slightly faster repose times, and better future performance; although I really haven't been able to tell much of a difference so far.  AZ1 is supposed to be faster and more efficient, and allow voice commands to be processed locally instead of having to go to the cloud; so we'll see if this is noticeable in the future.-ZIGBEE/SIDEWALK – The previous version included a Zigbee hub, but this version also includes Amazon Sidewalk compatibility.  Sidewalk is a long range connection technology that Amazon plans to use for devices that will be able to reach much further; (the initial announcement estimated up to half a mile).  This technology isn't really being used yet, but it is nice to know this future tech is built in.THE BAD:-WHITE POWER CORD – Yes, for some reason that same white power cord that ships with the Echo 4th Gen is also included for this Show 10.  No matter what color Show you get (I got black), you still get a white power cord.  I'm a little surprised that they went with this decision again, but it really doesn't bother me much at all.  Just thought I'd mention it in case that matters to you.-LARGE FOOTPRINT – Since the device rotates, you really have to be careful about where you put it.  The Show 10 comes with a footprint guide, that suggests that you make sure you have enough space around the device to avoid the screen knocking over a glass of water, for example.  This also wasn't a big deal for me, but keep in mind you will probably need more space than the previous version.  The specs recommend a 10” by 15” space, but I think you could get away with less.*Note – You can disable the movement by saying “Alexa disable Motion,” or by turning it off in the Alexa app on your phone.  Also, when you first setup your Show, there is a slider bar that let's you choose how far the screen should rotate in each direction.  It seems to go almost 360 degrees maximum, but you can limit the radius so it turns much less.  You can also change this in the 'Motion' menu under Settings.Overall, I am VERY pleased with this new Show 10.  The camera clarity is great, and the face tracking technology is so impressive; there's just nothing else like it for video calls to our family.  This is a huge upgrade!\n"", ""\n  First the camera is offset, so the screen is always offset when it follow you, that is when it does actually follow you, because more than half of the time it does not, and God forbid you try to touch the monitor, because it will constantly tell you the screen has bumped into something... It has way too many bugs in the software ... I am not at all impressed with this update, because it doesn't seem like a lot of thought went into this model!BUT ... My biggest gripe has to do with the electrical cord, it is way too short, and plugs into the bottom of the base, which is also insanely difficult to reach without the monitor swinging all around, and good forbid you have to unplug it for any reason, because it will constantly make you put in your password over and over!I am sorry, but this update is a big fail! It is definitely not ready for consumers! They really should have worked out the bugs before releasing it to the public! This unit truly seems like it should be in beta testing still, because it has way too many issues that need to be addressed!Update: The advertisement makes it look as if you can use the device to scan one’s surroundings, when not at home, but what only the small print reveals, which most people will miss, that it only does this FOR A PRICE AND with a SUBSCRIPTION to HOME GUARD plus!At $250, this should have been included, at least for a year, free of charge! I bought this believing I could scan a room, from my mobile device, only to find out ... you can’t, NOT EVEN WHEN YOU ARE AT HOME! Really Amazon, you couldn’t include that at least for a year free! As a prime member, for many years, I find this totally unacceptable, from a billion dollar company, that is charging way too much for this device!\n"", '\n  \xa0My main issue with it are the bugs. The screen goes past you. The screen stops rotating on its own. Some of the apps that work on older Echo Show’s have issues. This one has potential but they need to patch it though.\n']"

Price is good.2. Long battery life, still have 69% after 3 days usage from 100% full charged ( auto sleep tracking and heart rate detection set to 5 min, and app alerts )3. Light weight no problem wear during sleep at nightCon:1. The weather need to improve on the Amazfit app, unable to locate the city i live, it detected nearby city with incorrect temperature. The app also won't auto detected my work city.2. The sleep monitor will not track afternoon nap, I took 2-3 hours sleep in the afternoon and the app has no data.3. Only 2 default watch face are customizable.4. No ECG5. No user guide manual, download from Amazfit or AmazonUpdate 9/3/20After 6 months of usage, I noticed the battery drain so fast, fully changed before bed time, after 6 hours 76%. This watch usually last 10 days per change, not sure if this relate to last update.Contacted Amazfit support hopefully they can figure out the issue, otherwise, this will be my last MIC product.\n"", ""\n  Initially I wanted to buy a Galaxy active watch, as I have sold my Apple watch 3 due to poor battery performance. But Galaxy active original has a very small dial, and active 2 is little big for me(  44 mm) and out of budget. Garmins are good but very poor display and plastic type looks like baby toys to me,(those are under $230)In such a situation, this is my first Amazfit product. I found a 52 hours battery life with always on heart beat monitoring.I don't keep it connected to my mobile continuously.Good screen, so far seems solid. I liked it. It has so many features which I have not used, but I was searching for a inbuilt thermometer.I am not much serious about the data I get from smart watches, they are near perfect about foot steps,  It showed me that my heart stopped for a couple of minutes while asleep, that was funny!!One can give it a try,The lie of 15 days battery life, I see it as art of advertise.\n"", ""\n  Bought this watch as a backup to my Apple Watch, as when doing certain activities I didn't want to risk breaking a $400+ watch.  My expectations with this GTS were fillfulled and I can recommend this to others.  Below, are my pros and cons to the GTS after using it for just under one month.Pros...1) Large screen that is sharp and provides good resolution.2) Battery life is amazing.  I normally charge at 10% power remaining, after using the watch for 8-9 days.3) Contains most key core functionalities that work sufficient ly. Steps, Heart Rate, PAI, sleep, SMS, and other alerting tools.4)  Satisfactory build quality.  The band is very comfortable to wear.5) Light weight and not bulky that you won't noticed you are wearing a watch.CONs... (As comparing to the Apple Watch)1) Screen is dim and hard to see outdoors2) Application software is limited.3) Accuracy to the HR and Steps... I find that it is 3-5% less steps than the Apple watch and HR about 1% less.4) Since watch is light weight, it doesn't feel premium or high quality.5) Moving better apps on the screen is slow... There is latency.Overall... I know I shouldn't compare this to the Apple Watch...it's not fair as the price point is almost 4 to 1.  I do have to say that it met my expectations and it is worth the cost and investment.\n"", ""\n  Pros:Good battery life (if you don't use the GPS)Good selection of watch faces (if you days wait for Zepp to populate copies to your app or hack third-party sites)Lightweight (you'll not notice you're wearing it)Incredible display with auto brightness (even readable in full sun)Cons:Distance tracked using watch GPS can be off by an order of magnitude. This might be an app problem, dunno, but I cycled 10 km and the report in Google Fit (auto exported by the Zepp app) was 0.7 km. Useless.Countdown timer only works as dedicated app, you can't switch to exercise tracking or anything else and have it continue to run. Almost useless since you can't even tell the time when the countdown timer is running.Only one downloaded watch face can be stored on the watch (why?). You have to sync any other choices, very slowly from the app. The watch has enough memory to store a number of .bin files, but it isn't addressable.No third party apps or add ons other than watch faces.\n"", '\n  The ""notifications"" and ""music control"" features do not work with my motorola Moto G5s Plus smart phone.  I\'ve followed the instructions but the Amazfit phone app does not show the same settings listed in the manual or the app\'s ""help"" section. Very disappointing since I\'ve had the Amazfit Pace watch for 18 months and it works great. Perhaps a future watch firmware or app upgrade with fix this?\n', '\n  I like this watch a lot. I bought it for my 12 year old grandson.  After seeing my amazfit bip he really wanted a smart watch for Christmas.  He would have been satisfied with the bip after I let him borrow mine and take it home with him.  But I found the amazfit gts and it was a lot more upgraded than my bip so I bought him this watch. He was really excited about getting it for Christmas.  It has a lot of activities to track and  a lot of watch faces to choose from. And being able to use your own photo for a watch face is really impressive.  The sleep tracking is accurate.  I checked my bpm with my blood pressure machine and it seems perfectly accurate.  The battery only lasted me about 10 days but that was with using the GPS for a 14 mile bike ride twice during the week I had it. So I think that is still a really great battery life.  So all in all I would definitely buy this watch again and have already recommended it to others. When I need to replace my bip I will definitely be buying this watch for myself.  My grandson wanted the black but I would get the pink or gold for myself. The watch band is soft and more flexible than my bip. Feels like a really nice band.  Yes I love this watch so go buy one. You will not regret it.\n', '\n  Espetacular muito bom, custo beneficio. Só deixa a desejar pq não atende ligação, mas ao adquiri-lo já sabia dessa limitação. Nada incomoda para dormir com ele.

My review will be divided into three parts: aesthetics, functionality and reservations.1. Aesthetics.  I initially was concerned about how these frames would look.  In particular, I was afraid they would be bulky - especially the temples (i.e. the part of the glasses connecting the lenses to your ears), where most of the electronics are.  Have no fear on this point -  I\'ve been wearing these frames for the better part of a year, and not only has no one ever said anything to me about them (unless I start interacting with Alexa), but I\'ve never even noticed anyone looking at them funny.  I think this may be because one tends to look directly at another person\'s face, thereby losing the depth perception that would make the temples more noticeable.The frames themselves are inoffensive.  While they may not be for everyone, they will look fine on most people, regardless of age or gender.  Think of them as new-nerdy-chic.2. Functionality.  Overall, I have been very pleased with the functionality of my frames.  I use them primarily for phone calls and for listening to music, podcasts or baseball games in situations were I need to be able to hear what is going on around me.  The phone call quality is excellent: not only can I hear exceptionally well, but I\'ve been told by those on the other end of the line that they can hear me better than when I am speaking directly into my phone.  Upon a moment\'s reflection, this isn\'t hard to understand.  The frames sit on your nose, an inch or two above your mouth.  The mics have been well placed to take advantage of this proximity and - unlike when you\'re holding a phone in your hand - their placement with respect to your mouth is not constantly changing.In general, listening to music, podcasts or baseball has also been a positive experience.  You shouldn\'t expect Bose-quality surround sound, and the frames definitely won\'t bring out the best of, eg. Yo-Yo Ma, but the sound quality is fine - especially for podcasts and baseball games.  In most situations, I can hear whatever I am listening to without entirely tuning out the outside world and without everyone around me hearing it too (something I wish I had 15 years ago, when I was working in a cubicle next to my supervisor).  This is especially useful for me now: since the pandemic began, I\'ve been at home with my 4 year old kid most of the time.  I can\'t afford to have earbuds in when I\'m watching him, since I need to be able to respond to him and to hear him when I can\'t see him.  My Echo frames allow me to listen to the news or make a phone call while watching him at the playground, going on a walk, or doing things around the house.  I also find them useful for outdoor activities near the home.  For instance, I have a flock of chickens.  I try to let them out in the yard as often as possible, but need to watch them closely to protect them from coyotes and hawks.  My frames allow me to interact with my wife by phone or listen to a podcast while also being able to hear, eg., my chickens\' warning cry when they see a threat.  Very useful.I have found the frames less useful in more urban settings.  I live in greater Boston, in one of those quaint small New England towns 10 minutes from the city.  When I am in the town center, I find the frames more or less useless.  Why?  When a car passes me on the sidewalk, I can\'t hear whatever I\'m listening to.  I can turn up the volume - but once the car has passed, the volume is ludicrously loud.  I can decrease the volume - but traffic is such that a car will pass every half a minute or so.  So to use them effectively in this setting, I\'d basically have to keep my finger on the volume button at all times - which would make me look kind of like Cyclops from the X-Men right before he blasts someone.  Perhaps I would find this less annoying in Boston proper, where a steadier flow of traffic would allow me to keep the volume on max all the time.In terms of battery life: I find I can wear my glasses all day, using them intermittently, without any difficulty.  In terms of continuous use: I can listen to a baseball game or talk on the phone for about 2 hours before I start getting a low-battery warning.  Overall, I find this quite satisfactory.3. Reservations.  As noted above, I find the frames more or less useless in situations where the background noise varies in its intensity from moment to moment.  This may in part be because my own hearing isn\'t great.  I also have sometimes had some trouble charging the frames.  Here\'s the problem: I turn my frames off prior to charging.  The charging process itself, however, turns them back on.  When they\'re on, they automatically connect to my phone.  What seems to happen is this: the battery fully charges, but then begins to discharge again immediately because the frames are connected to my phone.  Consequently, on a few occasions, I\'ve awakened after plugging my glasses in  the night before to find them almost completely discharged.  This seems like a bug that can easily be fixed - if it hasn\'t already been in Gen 2.I also find myself thinking a few easy-to-add features would significantly improve the Echo Frames.  A reading light would be really useful for, eg. reading in bed without disturbing your partner.  And a find-my-glasses feature would be much appreciated.  This latter feature represents a level of functionality that the engineers at Amazon have not yet explored: features designed for when you\'re *not* actively using your glasses.Overall, I am pleased enough with my glasses that I went ahead and purchased a Gen 2 set.  I think they are ideal for parents, for folks whose work spaces prohibit listening to the radio, and for certain outdoor activities.  If, however, you\'re going to use them primarily in an environment where the level of background noise is constantly varying, you should prepare to be disappointed.**A quick word on cost: I wouldn\'t pay $ 250 out-of-pocket for these glasses.  However, they are worth it if covered at least in part by any insurance benefits you might have.  The $ 250 cost is, moreover, in line with the (inflated) cost of frames these days*****UPDATE 02/10/2021*** A lot of reviewers have expressed concerns over privacy.  While there are very legitimate privacy concerns with respect to any Echo (Google, Facebook, Apple) device, as well as with respect to the Alexa app, I fail to see how the frames by themselves pose any greater privacy risk than ear buds.  Why?  Because at any point, you can turn off the mic or, if you prefer, disconnect them from the Alexa app (by stopping the app) and use them simply as any other bluetooth device.  Alternatively, you can just turn off the frames entirely and wear them as plain old glasses.  Even if left on and connected, it\'s hard to see how their ~10 hour battery life could result in ""24/7"" tracking, as some reviewers claim.Upshot: privacy concerns are real, but they pertain more immediately to the Alexa app or the various Echo devices that have Alexa built into them than they do to devices, such as the Echo frames, for which Alexa is not, in fact, an integrated component.\n', ""\n  This allows Amazon to track and record everything that you do and say. Amazon will know what you do 24/7. What you say will be recorded. It will know what you do on a daily basis, what you like and dislike, etc. This is Big Brother, Amazon edition. This is a total invasion of your privacy. Don't sacrifice your privacy for convenience. Please don't buy.\n"", ""\n  What is the point of these things?  The audio quality is not good enough to listen to music on them.  I imagine most of us already have echo devices throughout our homes, so why wear glasses to give echo commands or ask it questions?  most of us have our phones connected to our cars bluetooth systems, so these glasses are unnecessary there....and the battery (still in this second generation Frames) went from 100% to 20% battery after only 20 minutes, so you couldn't use them regularly for a whole day.  For me this is a useless, expensive product that misses the mark big time.\n"", ""\n  These Gen 2 Echo Frames are a slight upgrade from the Gen 1 version; with two new colors, slightly better sound quality, and longer battery life.Here are my thoughts so far:PROS:-Hands-free Alexa:  Having Alexa on your face is pretty nice.  I really like taking calls or listening to text messages on the Frames, and call quality is very good.  Everyone seems to be able to hear me clearly.  I prefer these Frames over earbuds for hands-free calls, partly because wearing these doesn't affect your ability to hear things going on around you.  I always feel like my hearing is impaired slightly when I'm walking around with earbuds in, but these make it feel like I can still hear everything else well too.  I also have enjoyed using these to access shopping lists, just to make having to shop in stores slightly easier.-Easy Setup:  Setup is super easy.  Just open the Alexa app on your phone, follow the instructions and you're up and running in less than a minute.-Stylish:  I personally like the way that these frames look; but of course that is personal opinion.  It is nice that there are now three different color options, so there is a decent chance that at least one of them will work for you.-Battery life:  These seem much batter than the Gen 1 versions so far.  It seems like they have enough battery power to easily last through the day, and I recharge them at night while I sleep.CONS:– Music Listening: While the speakers are great for phone conversations, or hearing messages from Alexa, they are FAR inferior to most earbuds for listening to music.  The nature of this type of speaker setup doesn't really lend itself to producing booming bass or crisp mid-range sound.  It might be adequate for elevator music; but if you are used to quality headphones or earbuds, these are not great in comparison.-Cost:  At $250 currently, these seem like they are a bit overpriced for what they offer.  Having Alexa access on your head is nice; but various earbuds including the Echo Buds offer that functionality as well, often with MUCH better sound quality for music listening, and longer battery life.  I personally like these Echo Frames, but it would be hard for me imagine them being the best option for most people.OVERALL:Based on the current price, it seems like these will only be worthwhile to pretty small number of people.  You have to remember that if you need prescription lenses, you are looking at an additional cost to get your lenses put in at Lens Crafters or another store.  If you were thinking about getting some new glasses anyway, and you would find the hands-free Alexa access and calling/texting very useful, then these might be perfect for you.  For many people though, I feel like any Alexa-enabled earbuds might be a better option currently, especially if you enjoy listening to music.(I will try to update this review after using these for a few more months if I have any additional thoughts)\n"", '\n  Poor sound, 2 right lenses, constantly disconnects from Alexa app. Even when I have Alexa app locked in memory. Waste of money, and failed to function even as glasses frames due to the incorrect lenses included. The glasses look ridiculous on my face with 2 right lens shapes, it makes my eye look droopy. This product is a disaster!\n']"

So when I asked if maybe we should consider getting a Bose speaker system for our den, my husband got on board because it's something he'd never had the opportunity to really experience.I will say: the Bose Smart Sound Bar 300 is just not what I had expected and hyped up to my husband. In fact, I am a little embarrassed. It seems that in 2020, the technology of today's TV speakers means a sound bar really isn't needed anymore. Alexa on the Bose Sound Bar tries her hardest, but doesn't perform as well as our firestick TV remote does, and when it comes to on/off syncing with the TV, it looks like Bose hasn't fixed that either because I recall that being an issue with their systems in the early 00s.Pros:- Incredibly streamlined- Attractive color and shape- Alexa or Google ready- Can be used with ARC HDMI cable, but is not provided- ResponsiveCons:- Weird TV/Sound Bar sync issues where one forgets the other is off and it has to be reset to work again- Lack of literature on how to operate the sound bar- Can be used with ARC HDMI cable, but is not provided and is necessary in order to use App, which helps set up the sound bar- Incredibly frustrating to set upOverall, it's been a fun toy to have. Like I said though, I almost feel embarrassed to have talked about what a great company Bose is and then have this experience. It was INCREDIBLY frustrating to set the Sound Bar up and the syncing issues with the TV got old FAST. I would consider myself very technology capable, but the Sound Bar doesn't sound much better than the actual TV we have, and just doesn't seem like a very good value considering.\n"", '\n  Bought new LG tv, love it. Bought sound bar to enhance experience, but have had all kinds of trouble with Bluetooth connection causing channels to flicker in and out. Not easy set up either. No real help in internet troubleshooting and no instruction manual at  all for help. It’s probably me but very very disappointed in a product made by Bose.\n', ""\n  Garbage sound when watching tv. Playing music through it isn't bad. Very displeased with the sound considering how much it is.\n"", '\n  This soundbar is exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price. The sound quality is great and it fits perfectly with my 42"" TV.I love having Alexa in the soundbar as it controls my TV and my FireTV. I use it to listen to music during the day now too working from home now. I honestly feel like the purchase has been 10/10, no regrets and I would 100% recommend to anyone. Great price, ample functionality, and amazing sound.\n', ""\n  I ordered direct from Bose & saved $30 with my education discount.  This is my first soundbar, reluctantly as I have an older but very functional and loud 5.1 system. I'm older now and just don't need the space it takes up nor earth-shaking bass. This new 300 is like a combination of the older 500 and 700 models in size and sound.It's loud, it's clear, and after adjusting the bass, treble, and mid sounds on the app - it's a very well balanced sound great for TV, movies, and Music.  I'm impressed.Alexa works great.  And the Bose Music App well it's awesome.  I do have the 300 Home speaker (which is also ridiculously loud and easy to use) so this prompted me to stay in-brand as I can connect the speakers with the app. My favorite part of the app is I can control the volumes anywhere in the house - so I when I go to bed and my wife is still up and the tv is too loud, I lower it myself.I set up with HDMI Arc on my LQ 75in TV - it took 2 tries but it works.  One LG remote controls the tv, soundbar, and AppleTV.I don't have cable TV but you need that in order to use the new Voice4Video Bose built-in.  Alexa won't control my AppleTV nor TV like 'change input'. It's really meant for changing channels on a cable box.Very pleased.  I can't imagine the Sonos Beam which this is meant to compete with, sounds as good.\n"", '\n  I connected this to the HDMI (ARC) of a Sony 85 inch TV XBR85X900 and it started working right away with no setup. Later the TV did ask what to do on power up, to use external or not.The sound is great for music, on TV shows the voices could be better. For such a little bar the base is pretty good. It does need a dedicated base though because there is no real base punch or rumble with the bar.I love the added Alexa and Google assistant. But I did find once you start using that to play music or other things and the TV is still on they get out of sync and the TV does not use it as an audio bar unless you power it off and back on.\n', ""\n  It works as well as it looks: has a nice look and feels well-built! It sounds nice, but it would sound even better with the whole set. It works well for me for now since I live in a small apartment, but I might consider getting the whole set someday. Otherwise it works great: I got it to work through HDMI ARC and optical connections. I can't speak for the Bluetooth connection since the other connection options work perfectly fine and as a result I didn't bother checking out the BT option. Overall I'm quite satisfied with this soundbar!\n"", '\n  Bose Smart Soundbar 300 Bluetooth connectivity with Alexa Voice Control Built in, BlackEasy to set up and connect to television and to music appsIncludes a small remote with a simple to use interfaceEasy to sync in order to use Apple airplayOnly item we’ve not been able set-up and Alexa voice control at this point is are cable box beginning to wonder if this is due to cable boxes age possiblySound quality is what you would expect from Bose it’s absolutely beautiful and strongWether we are watching television or listening to music the sound transfers beautifully and clearly.The Bose app does give the option to go through and adjust or tweak items such as the bass and trebleWe replaced and larger sound bar and sub woofer with this Bose sound bar and could not be happier with are choice in doing so\n', '\n  I was excited to try this sound bar but I was a bit put off by all the negative comments. I have to say that I absolutely love this speaker using it with both tv and music.It is very quick to set up and the speaker comes with both of the cables you need to get it working. It took about 10 minutes to get set up and that includes downloading the BOSE and Alexa app and setting up all my info to create accounts. The sound bar is 2 inches high and I have it set up right I front of my tv. The included remote can turn the sound bar on and off, switch between tv and music, Bluetooth, change the volume, and ship tracks and such. Once you set up the Bose app, you can connect to local radio stations as well.The sound from this sound bar is awesome. I have always found Bose to be the best at clear sound and accenting all of the smaller sounds normal speakers may not pick up. Our cable provided has a problem that the sound isn’t always synced correctly with the video so it looks a bit off. This speaker syncs perfectly.The music played sounds amazing! I’ve played everything from classical to hard rock and everything sounds crystal clear and awesome. I love how little space it takes, the remote, Alexa or google voice, and how awesome everything sounds.\n', ""\n  Bose has a big name when it comes to sound devices. I had high expectations receiving this to review.Hookup - It comes very well packed and extremely easy to hook up. Basically, take it out of the box, plug it into a power source, download the app, and follow the instructions.Design - Very sleek and rich design. Sturdy.🔊Sound🔊 - I have been spoiled by good surround sound in my living room with 5.1 speakers and a Yamaha Receiver. While I cannot do a direct comparison to my current settings, a small comparison is obvious whether such a soundbar can replace 5.1 or not(or even a 3.1). Saying that I am super impressed by the sound. The sound is 1000 times better than what is coming out of TV speakers, and I am talking 2019 TV. The lows, mids, and highs are clear, although the lows can be a little better. The bass is good but I find a little flat. Lacks a little in softness as well. The surround sound is pretty good!📶 Smart - > This soundbar is smart - it has inbuilt Alexa and Google voice- You can set up either or and works flawlessly. It connects to your wi-fi and you can also connect it via Bluetooth!🈸The app is also simple to understand, and has radio channels that you can listen to - and also pre-set the channels. Alexa hears you no matter how loud you are playing your music/movie/tv... From audio setting perspective, it only has 3 options - Bass, Center Channel, and Trebel. Anyone on your Wi-fi network can be allowed (or not) to download the app and use the soundbar.There are 2 buttons on the top of the bar - one is to turn of the mic so that Alexa won't hear you 😁 and the other is the on/off button. If you want🛑Cons-------Does not include HDMI cableCannot be hooked up to a receiver or any other speaker/subwoofer. If you want to expand this, you have to buy more Bose products.Audio setting thru app is very minimalMy final verdict - If you do not have room for surround sound speakers, even 3.1 (Center speaker, 2 side speakers and a subwoofer), go for Bose Smart Soundbar, otherwise, my recommendation is 3.1. You can build a good 3.1 in almost the same range as the cost of this Bose 300 soundbar!!\n"", ""\n  I am quite impressed by the quality of sound from this slim soundbar. We have an open-concept living room, and the soundbar is still able to fill the space with sound that is clear, clean, and immersive. The soundbar is small enough that it slides under our TV, so it essentially takes up no room at all.Setup is very simple--use either an optical audio cable (included) or an HDMI cable (not included) to attach the soundbar to your TV and then plug it in. Done! The Bose app will help you finish setting up some other settings. And, if you choose to connect via HDMI and your TV supports ARC, the soundbar will turn on with your TV and you can control it with your TV's remote.The soundbar has BlueTooth capabilities, so I've paired it with my phone and often use it to play music. We've also used it when watching movies and playing games, and the sound in all situations is great (and noticeably better than the sound provided by the built-in TV speakers).\n"", '\n  Sometimes asking Alexa to turn OFF the TV requires 2 or 3 tries as the TV will shut down and turn ON again.Also command to tune to chanel 1211, it will only tune to chanel 121. Way around that is to command to tune to channel 1209 and then command ""next channel""  (there is no channel 1210 through our provider)I like that we can listen to other options with this system such as podcasts, radio, and Sirius XM, etc., all on the same device......all using voice command - as I am blind and this increases my independence.\n', '\n  Lo más nuevo de Bose, y ofertada a buen precio, y lo mas importante, se escucha muy bien, sus bocinas laterales hacen eco en las paredes en ciertos sonidos, simulando sonidos provenientes de bocinas en paredes, excelente tecnología, los bajos se escuchan bien, aunque para completar compraré el Bass Module 500.La configuración de la app Bosé cuesta un poco de trabajo, pero finalmente se logra, Alexa tiene buenos chistes.., en fin, un producto altamente recomendable para gente exigente en calidad de audio,  la Barra de Sonido Smart Soundbar 300\n']"

My review will be divided into three parts: aesthetics, functionality and reservations.1. Aesthetics.  I initially was concerned about how these frames would look.  In particular, I was afraid they would be bulky - especially the temples (i.e. the part of the glasses connecting the lenses to your ears), where most of the electronics are.  Have no fear on this point -  I\'ve been wearing these frames for the better part of a year, and not only has no one ever said anything to me about them (unless I start interacting with Alexa), but I\'ve never even noticed anyone looking at them funny.  I think this may be because one tends to look directly at another person\'s face, thereby losing the depth perception that would make the temples more noticeable.The frames themselves are inoffensive.  While they may not be for everyone, they will look fine on most people, regardless of age or gender.  Think of them as new-nerdy-chic.2. Functionality.  Overall, I have been very pleased with the functionality of my frames.  I use them primarily for phone calls and for listening to music, podcasts or baseball games in situations were I need to be able to hear what is going on around me.  The phone call quality is excellent: not only can I hear exceptionally well, but I\'ve been told by those on the other end of the line that they can hear me better than when I am speaking directly into my phone.  Upon a moment\'s reflection, this isn\'t hard to understand.  The frames sit on your nose, an inch or two above your mouth.  The mics have been well placed to take advantage of this proximity and - unlike when you\'re holding a phone in your hand - their placement with respect to your mouth is not constantly changing.In general, listening to music, podcasts or baseball has also been a positive experience.  You shouldn\'t expect Bose-quality surround sound, and the frames definitely won\'t bring out the best of, eg. Yo-Yo Ma, but the sound quality is fine - especially for podcasts and baseball games.  In most situations, I can hear whatever I am listening to without entirely tuning out the outside world and without everyone around me hearing it too (something I wish I had 15 years ago, when I was working in a cubicle next to my supervisor).  This is especially useful for me now: since the pandemic began, I\'ve been at home with my 4 year old kid most of the time.  I can\'t afford to have earbuds in when I\'m watching him, since I need to be able to respond to him and to hear him when I can\'t see him.  My Echo frames allow me to listen to the news or make a phone call while watching him at the playground, going on a walk, or doing things around the house.  I also find them useful for outdoor activities near the home.  For instance, I have a flock of chickens.  I try to let them out in the yard as often as possible, but need to watch them closely to protect them from coyotes and hawks.  My frames allow me to interact with my wife by phone or listen to a podcast while also being able to hear, eg., my chickens\' warning cry when they see a threat.  Very useful.I have found the frames less useful in more urban settings.  I live in greater Boston, in one of those quaint small New England towns 10 minutes from the city.  When I am in the town center, I find the frames more or less useless.  Why?  When a car passes me on the sidewalk, I can\'t hear whatever I\'m listening to.  I can turn up the volume - but once the car has passed, the volume is ludicrously loud.  I can decrease the volume - but traffic is such that a car will pass every half a minute or so.  So to use them effectively in this setting, I\'d basically have to keep my finger on the volume button at all times - which would make me look kind of like Cyclops from the X-Men right before he blasts someone.  Perhaps I would find this less annoying in Boston proper, where a steadier flow of traffic would allow me to keep the volume on max all the time.In terms of battery life: I find I can wear my glasses all day, using them intermittently, without any difficulty.  In terms of continuous use: I can listen to a baseball game or talk on the phone for about 2 hours before I start getting a low-battery warning.  Overall, I find this quite satisfactory.3. Reservations.  As noted above, I find the frames more or less useless in situations where the background noise varies in its intensity from moment to moment.  This may in part be because my own hearing isn\'t great.  I also have sometimes had some trouble charging the frames.  Here\'s the problem: I turn my frames off prior to charging.  The charging process itself, however, turns them back on.  When they\'re on, they automatically connect to my phone.  What seems to happen is this: the battery fully charges, but then begins to discharge again immediately because the frames are connected to my phone.  Consequently, on a few occasions, I\'ve awakened after plugging my glasses in  the night before to find them almost completely discharged.  This seems like a bug that can easily be fixed - if it hasn\'t already been in Gen 2.I also find myself thinking a few easy-to-add features would significantly improve the Echo Frames.  A reading light would be really useful for, eg. reading in bed without disturbing your partner.  And a find-my-glasses feature would be much appreciated.  This latter feature represents a level of functionality that the engineers at Amazon have not yet explored: features designed for when you\'re *not* actively using your glasses.Overall, I am pleased enough with my glasses that I went ahead and purchased a Gen 2 set.  I think they are ideal for parents, for folks whose work spaces prohibit listening to the radio, and for certain outdoor activities.  If, however, you\'re going to use them primarily in an environment where the level of background noise is constantly varying, you should prepare to be disappointed.**A quick word on cost: I wouldn\'t pay $ 250 out-of-pocket for these glasses.  However, they are worth it if covered at least in part by any insurance benefits you might have.  The $ 250 cost is, moreover, in line with the (inflated) cost of frames these days*****UPDATE 02/10/2021*** A lot of reviewers have expressed concerns over privacy.  While there are very legitimate privacy concerns with respect to any Echo (Google, Facebook, Apple) device, as well as with respect to the Alexa app, I fail to see how the frames by themselves pose any greater privacy risk than ear buds.  Why?  Because at any point, you can turn off the mic or, if you prefer, disconnect them from the Alexa app (by stopping the app) and use them simply as any other bluetooth device.  Alternatively, you can just turn off the frames entirely and wear them as plain old glasses.  Even if left on and connected, it\'s hard to see how their ~10 hour battery life could result in ""24/7"" tracking, as some reviewers claim.Upshot: privacy concerns are real, but they pertain more immediately to the Alexa app or the various Echo devices that have Alexa built into them than they do to devices, such as the Echo frames, for which Alexa is not, in fact, an integrated component.\n', ""\n  This allows Amazon to track and record everything that you do and say. Amazon will know what you do 24/7. What you say will be recorded. It will know what you do on a daily basis, what you like and dislike, etc. This is Big Brother, Amazon edition. This is a total invasion of your privacy. Don't sacrifice your privacy for convenience. Please don't buy.\n"", ""\n  What is the point of these things?  The audio quality is not good enough to listen to music on them.  I imagine most of us already have echo devices throughout our homes, so why wear glasses to give echo commands or ask it questions?  most of us have our phones connected to our cars bluetooth systems, so these glasses are unnecessary there....and the battery (still in this second generation Frames) went from 100% to 20% battery after only 20 minutes, so you couldn't use them regularly for a whole day.  For me this is a useless, expensive product that misses the mark big time.\n"", ""\n  These Gen 2 Echo Frames are a slight upgrade from the Gen 1 version; with two new colors, slightly better sound quality, and longer battery life.Here are my thoughts so far:PROS:-Hands-free Alexa:  Having Alexa on your face is pretty nice.  I really like taking calls or listening to text messages on the Frames, and call quality is very good.  Everyone seems to be able to hear me clearly.  I prefer these Frames over earbuds for hands-free calls, partly because wearing these doesn't affect your ability to hear things going on around you.  I always feel like my hearing is impaired slightly when I'm walking around with earbuds in, but these make it feel like I can still hear everything else well too.  I also have enjoyed using these to access shopping lists, just to make having to shop in stores slightly easier.-Easy Setup:  Setup is super easy.  Just open the Alexa app on your phone, follow the instructions and you're up and running in less than a minute.-Stylish:  I personally like the way that these frames look; but of course that is personal opinion.  It is nice that there are now three different color options, so there is a decent chance that at least one of them will work for you.-Battery life:  These seem much batter than the Gen 1 versions so far.  It seems like they have enough battery power to easily last through the day, and I recharge them at night while I sleep.CONS:– Music Listening: While the speakers are great for phone conversations, or hearing messages from Alexa, they are FAR inferior to most earbuds for listening to music.  The nature of this type of speaker setup doesn't really lend itself to producing booming bass or crisp mid-range sound.  It might be adequate for elevator music; but if you are used to quality headphones or earbuds, these are not great in comparison.-Cost:  At $250 currently, these seem like they are a bit overpriced for what they offer.  Having Alexa access on your head is nice; but various earbuds including the Echo Buds offer that functionality as well, often with MUCH better sound quality for music listening, and longer battery life.  I personally like these Echo Frames, but it would be hard for me imagine them being the best option for most people.OVERALL:Based on the current price, it seems like these will only be worthwhile to pretty small number of people.  You have to remember that if you need prescription lenses, you are looking at an additional cost to get your lenses put in at Lens Crafters or another store.  If you were thinking about getting some new glasses anyway, and you would find the hands-free Alexa access and calling/texting very useful, then these might be perfect for you.  For many people though, I feel like any Alexa-enabled earbuds might be a better option currently, especially if you enjoy listening to music.(I will try to update this review after using these for a few more months if I have any additional thoughts)\n"", '\n  Poor sound, 2 right lenses, constantly disconnects from Alexa app. Even when I have Alexa app locked in memory. Waste of money, and failed to function even as glasses frames due to the incorrect lenses included. The glasses look ridiculous on my face with 2 right lens shapes, it makes my eye look droopy. This product is a disaster!\n']"

I was a die hard Netgear owner for about 15 years. i decided to try something new for a few reasons.1. new routers are stupidly expensive. most Wifi 6 routers with any reasonable hardware are going to run $270+2. firmware issues are reported for both of the popular Netgear and Asus routers. lots of negative reviews.3. ""gamer"" price increase just because it is branded as ""gamer""4. sometimes trying new things is good.I settled on this TP-Link for a few reasons1. Wifi6 (AX####) if im going to get somthing new, i might as well get the newest technology (even know none of my devices can use it yet)2. it had a usb 3.0 ( most routers do at this point but it was on my list anyways due to network storage)3. less that $2004. gig+ Ethernet ports5. its a name i know of ( top 5 networking companies Netgear, Cisco, Asus, TP-Link, D-Link)Anyways on to the review.Design: pretty slick. thinner / smaller than i expected. antennas swivel with a little effort, but stay put when your finished moving them.  attaches to the wall with two screws ( not included ) the holes on the back of the device are roughly 8 1/2 inches apart. has an option to turn the LED\'s off at certain timesSetup: initial log in was done with a cable and my laptop, the rest of the setup was completed once i replaced it on the wall where my old router was ( hard wires / cable modem location ) pretty standard set up. my router was defaulted to 192.168.0.1. once i got to the page i was prompted to set up a password. i later changed my network to use 192.168.1.1 ( like my last router) there was some quick set up first run type questions it asked. i later went in a specified permanent ports for my wired desktops which was a breeze. i also updated the firmware which was painless. one major pro with this was you can make changes to the router configuration, and you never need to reboot the router ( firmware being the only rebooting action of all the settings i changed. )Speed: wired connections were reading 500mbps to the xfinity.speedtest.net which is what im paying for speed wise. my google pixel 2 wireless speed test to the google site was reading 320 mbps. i cant complain here, so im pretty happy with that.networked storage: i plugged in our families 256GB photo archive thumbdrive to the router, was getting consistent 30mbps transfer from desktop to thumbdrive. pretty happy with that, as its about as fast as i get when its plugged into my desktop.All and all  im pretty happy with it, will keep this review updated as time goes on.\n', ""\n  I am so pleased with this router in my home network. Unlike the Linksys, Cisco and Netgear models it has not dropped out or failed to see all my devices in the home network yet. With Windows 10 being so misbehaved most of the time with networking the TP-Link AX6000 makes up for it. I'm not all that interested in WiFi but it does work very well. I'd say a little stronger if not the same than my Netgear Nighthawk R7000.( In the garage now as Access Point)The TP-Link AX6000 IMO is the best choice if you need to upgrade a older router or need to stabilize you home network. I does such a nice job with the IP addresses that I was totally surprised. I have 4 NAS, 5 SAN an 1 DAS and Split the IP addresses all over and not following the normal protocol like 192.168.1.102,103,104 ext.. I even took over my Static IP in 2 devices one was WD My Cloud ,which I didn't care and Qnap NAS. It did keep my static IP in the Qnap NAS but bumped it on the LAG.The software interface is so nice and easy. I enjoy using it much more than the other routers. Theirs not to much and just enough to control what you need. I only have one minor complainant their Share (TP-Share) feature will only allow 4 HDD whether they are in one docking case or with a USB hub. I'd like to see more. I have  a 4 bay dock with 2 drives and two SAD in a USB powered hub and they work great. In a 1000 base network average transfer speed is 98mbs-120mbs, depends on the files though it can be way better but much better than my Netgear.I did add a TP-Link Range Expanded (RE450) on the second floor to balance the wifi and it made a huge difference with the TP-Link AX6000 router in the basement. I was limited to the space I had were I wanted the router is why I picked the TP-Link AX6000. Most likely I would have went to the top model TP-Link with all the tall antennas.I hope this helps. I don't know why some of the others have trouble. I wouldn't let the bad revues scare you. If youhave everything running properly and good equipment in your system It should run as great as mine.Feel free to contact me here thru Amazon and I will get back to you if you need help. Update 03/08/2020:This TP-Link AX6000 router also works perfect with Greenlight Fiber Optic Networks. I pay for 500mbps up and 500mbps down and get all of it to the i3, i5 and i7 PC's. All my Samsung streaming devices also get their capacity bandwidth. Update 03/31/2020While re-initializing my ACER Aspire Windows Home Server I disconnected the TP-Link AX6000 Router from the modem to have a single connection with the network. and used a Netgear Nighthawk R7000 to hook up the the server. That left the rest of the house and network without internet and in house networking, so I thought.My Lorex video security , a TP-Link WiFi range extender and a lot of other Androids plus more was still hooked up to the TP-Link AX6000 router. They weren't hooked up to the Netgear I checked. Maybe I'm missing something but in the past when I've done this with a Netgear as the main router and a Cisco as the slave for repairing the ACER the results weren't the same. Some how the TP-Link AX 6000 sniffed out the signal from the Netgear R7000.I have to say on the contrary of the other negative reviews that this TP-Link AX 6000 is an amazing home router.No matter how many times I do things to any of the PS's in the network the router is still not loosing the connection to all the devices in the home network. Not like the Netgear did. Windows 10 is usually the culprit if something is missing.If this sounds to confusing please contact me for help. I just think you all should know all the you can. Update 04/11/2020Just a quick mention for the already much loved TP-Link AX6000 router. I had to re-initialize my ACER Aspire H340 Windows Home Server and everything went smooth and fast  with no problems. In the past with a Netgear Nighthawk R7000 and Cisco models it did not go so well. I'd have to put he ACER WHS on its own network and go from there.  If I tried with the WHS on the same network it was never found  in the network to start the initializing software.That's it just another plus for the TP-Link AX 6000. I'm going to recommend this router to Greenlight Networks to ad to their trusted router list.\n"", '\n  Esta reseña la estoy escribiendo después de un mes y medio de usar este router. Vivo en México, en un pequeño pueblo de provincia donde la máxima velocidad de internet es de 16 MB, 13 MB en horas pico. Tengo el módem de la compañía telefónica configurado en modo bridge y ahí le conecté este router.Lo bueno:Físicamente el router es pequeño y delgado, estéticamente luce bien.Tiene los clásicos orificios en la parte de abajo por si lo quieres montar en la pared.La distancia de alcance de la señal es mejor que un router Linksys que tengo desde hace 4 años.La configuración fue muy fácil con la aplicación que tiene TP-Link.Tengo dispositivos que usan la red de 2.4 GHz y se conectan sin problemas al router, la de 5GHz también funciona muy bien, no tengo dispositivos que usen ax (wifi 6), así que no se cómo funcione con esta tecnología.El router tiene buen manejo del ancho de banda, ya que puedo estar descargando cosas mientras los demás usuarios están revisando sus redes sociales en sus teléfonos y no se quejan por lentitud en la red.No se alenta si hay varios dispositivos conectados al mismo tiempo. La página del fabricante dice que puede manejar hasta 256 dispositivos conectados. Yo solo le conecto 20 entre celulares, TVs, android TV box, videojuegos. Los maneja sin problemas.Es muy bueno para el streaming de Netflix en TV, youtube, etc. La verdad se siente más rápida la navegación en internet en general con este router en comparación con el Linksys que sustituí; esto aun y con la mediocre velocidad de internet que ofrece la compañía de teléfonos en México para los pueblos en provincia; imaginen las maravillas que hará con una buena velocidad por fibra óptica.Lo malo:Para las características de antivirus, parental control y quos, debes pagar una mensualidad o anualidad para que se habiliten y poder utilizarlos (5.99 USD al mes). Mi módem anterior tenía esto gratis incluido.Se caliente mucho, y más en la parte de abajo; apliqué el ingenio mexicano y lo coloqué sobre dos lápices, uno de cada lado para que estuviera levantado y liberar un poco mejor el calor. Quizá montándolo en la pared libere mejor el calor.Conclusión:Es bueno para navegar y ver Netflix, Youtube, etc. en 4K HDR.  Tiene buena cobertura wifi. Si buscas un router para jugar en línea, mejor compra un router más caro que tenga el quos habilitado de fábrica.  Y aun pagando, las configuraciones de quos de este router no son muy buenas. Lo mejor de este router es su precio, además es un modelo del año 2019 y tiene un buen procesador. Si no eres un gamer que juega en línea, este router te servirá mucho.Le quité una estrella a mi calificación por el tema del quos, antivirus y parental control, que hay que pagar para usarlos. Cuando mi hija era más pequeña, utilicé mucho el parental control de mi router anterior; para que únicamente su celular y su computadora se desconectaran automáticamente de la red a las 10 de la noche y se conectaran nuevamente a las 9 de la mañana del día siguiente.\n', '\n  Current date is 7 April 2020. The WiFi 6 standard is going to be changing which will make this product depreciated. This product advertises ""built-in"" QoS, TrendMicro Antivirus, and Parental Controls; this is false advertising. There is nothing ""built-in"" about those 3 features. It uses a cloud service (SaaS) where you expose login to your router via WAN (creates a vulnerability) to get a TP-Link Cloud ID to access these services (which could end at any time or have down-time without notice). TP-Link is notoriously bad for updating firmware after a couple weeks of a product being released. The current router firmware version is 1.06 which I doubt will ever get updated again given TP-Link\'s track-record. Even though it is advertised as dual-core CPU, they didn\'t advertise the clock speed of each core and for good reason; they are clocked in the MHz; while under virtually no load, they were floating at around 30% CPU usage. I would not recommend this product for anyone.\n', '\n  Podría decir que es el mejor router por el precio.Le llevo usando cerca de un mes con una tarjeta WiFi 6 en mi PC y los resultados son los siguientes.Pros:-Buena cobertura(Entiendan que para la banda de 5GHz hay una potencia máxima de transmisión por ley, no importa si el router tiene 1 o 100 antenas y sí, la distancia de 5GHz es relativamente corta unos 20m SIN obstáculos y con paredes unos 5m máximo)-Instalación sencilla.-Aplicación para administrar la red.Cons:-El QOS gratis es dinámico, es decir sólo permite seleccionar a qué dispositivo le das prioridad, más no permite asignarle un ancho de banda a cada dispositivo. El QOS de paga sería un equivalente a servicios como WTFast o similares, que redireccionan el tráfico de tu red para optimizar la latencia. En mi opinión, hay mejores servicios para el mismo propósito por un mejor precio. Además, redireccionar todo el tráfico de tu red con fines de seguridad suena contradictorio, no? Uno activa su vpn terceros cuando va a jugar y listo, no la tiene activa todo el tiempo.-Para los que tienen duda con lo de WPA3, el router no lo tiene y NO significa que no sea un router oficial, el estándar aún no está completo y los parámetros no se han definido. Si alguno de ustedes prefiere pagar 500 USD por otro router con un estándar incompleto, adelante. De igual forma esos routers van a bajar drásticamente de precio en un par de años cuando se migre a WiFi 6.-La temperatura, la ficha técnica menciona que la temperatura de operación es de 40°C, pero les aseguro que fácilmente debe estar a unos 55°C la mayoría del tiempo y se siente al tacto, en mi caso no me ha dado problemas de estabilidad, nunca se ha caído el enlace, pero definitivamente es algo que afecta el desempeño. Eso es un problema de firmware y diseño de ventilación/disipadores y es el único defecto considerable que le veo.En resumen, ¿Por qué comprar este router?1.- Lo más importante es que tengas dispositivos con antenas WiFi 6, de no ser así sólo desperdicias tu dinero. El estándar es retrocompatible, pero el dinero extra lo pagas por los beneficios y si la mayoría de tus dispositivos en casa son WiFi 5 o anteriores, mejor compra un router ac de última generación por el mismo precio, más ancho de banda y con firmware bien optimizado.2.- Crees que comprar un router te va a solucionar el ping. Estás muy equivocado amigo, en ese caso es mejor cambiar de ISP.3.- Haces cosas como subir o leer archivos muy pesados a un disco duro que está conectado al router, ese es un muy buen motivo. Para conseguir un router así.4.- Si lo que quieres es que no te de lag cuando alguien se conecta, busca un router con 2 bandas y un QOS del tipo que sea, dejas la banda 2.4 para invitados y la de 5 para tu PC, consola de videojuegos,etc. Seleccionas tu dispositivo como el de mayor prioridad (en QOS dinámico) o le asignas un ancho de banda mínimo (en QOS estático) y listo. Reitero, el router no tiene que ser de última generación si no tienes dispositivos de última generación, busca el router que se adecúe a tus necesidades y compra sabiamente.\n', ""\n  The basic feature of QoS is also not free, you have to pay monthly payment for this device.And shockingly, for USB sharing it does not support secure FTP (sFTP); it supports only plain FTP; that's not secure at all.Thus I returned this device.\n"", ""\n  This was a scratch and dent purchase but there was actually no discernible damage to the router or accessories. I was having massive packet loss issues with the ASUS AC3200 router while playing COD Warzone. This was even after a reset of that modem and all appropriate ports forwarded. The The TP-Link AX3000 works flawlessly with COD and I couldn't be happier with the performance. Another reviewer suggested there is some sort of subscription fee for enabling things like QoS. I can state that is patently untrue. You just download the free app to your phone and register your account. From there, management of the router is done through the app interface, including QoS and family restrictions. I have no reservations recommending this router!\n""]"
