Very elegant (even on my big fingers) and noticeable without being overstated.  Ring was true to size and comes in a lovely box.\n', ""\n  I have been wearing this ring as my everyday ring for about a year. I purchased it because I wanted a ring that I didn't wouldn't worry about losing, bending, chipping, getting extremely dirty, etc. This ring fit the bill. I work with heavy tools and this ring only had a few scratches. None of the stones have fallen out, it has not tarnished or is bent. I don't take it off when doing dishes or showering. I haven't had it cleaned or cleaned it with anything other than dish water and soap.\n"", ""\n  This is a lovely ring for the price. While not as bright as the stock photo, there's plenty of sparkle and shine. This ring had a beautiful vintage appeal. Sizing is true. It's sterling so it's easy to polish with a cloth. It's important to evaluate this ring based upon the quality of the diamonds. Both the color and clarity ratings are clearly listed. It appears to be higher quality and is unique in style. The back band is thinner and contributes to overall wearability making it very comfortable. I love it!\n"", '\n  This ring is absolutely stunning! It looks so real all the way around. The materials are top quality and the inside is so smooth. Very comfortable to wear and not too wide on my petite hands. I love the vintage look and feel of it and it\'s pretty lightweight still. Band is nice and thick on the bottom and it\'s sparkles and shines in the sunlight (or any light really) likes it\'s real diamonds all around. (The sparkle didn\'t show up in the photos, and frankly the photos don\'t do it justice)I\'ve been wearing for almost a week now and I love it more each time I wear it. Bought it as a temporary wedding band while my own ring is being re-done at the jewelers. (16 year anniversary update)Couldn\'t be happier with this ""stand-in"" ring.\n', '\n  This is a great ring for the price. Yes, for $40 you are only getting diamond chips and they are microscopic tiny but they do catch the light and the ring does have some sparkle. The design is great and is has an awesome vintage feel to it. It has easily be worn alone or paired with other rings. It has a great weight to it and is super solid. Overall I love my ring for this price.\n', '\n  This ring is beautiful. It has a vintage look to it and It sparkles just enough. It looks better in person. Just beautiful. I got it to wear at work. It is kind of thick so that will take some getting used to. I will post pictures. :)\n', '\n  This sterling band looks just like the photo.  I purchased it on Prime Day for around $33.  Great deal.  Arrived promptly.  Gift box is very nice.  Quality is good, I plan to wear it with my vintage wedding ring that is white gold.  This ring is charming and can stand alone or be stacked with any other sterling or white gold ring for a great combination as a set.\n', '\n  This ring is very delicate and pretty. I ordered a size 8, but it is a bit tight and fits more like a 7.5. The diamonds are pretty small, but the ring has a nice sparkle to it. Definitely recommend!\n', '\n  I have had this ring for about a year and wore it often.  Beautiful design and has a vintage look.  However, after about a year, it started to discolour.

My husband thinks its gorgeous too, he's probably happy I'm wearing a ring on my left hand again üòÇ.... There is a small piece of dark paper that came with it, not sure what its for?\n"", ""\n  I love this ring! It's my new favorite. It has a thick, solid band in the back and gorgeous art deco styling on the front, giving it an antique, vintage feel. It's not too flashy (yes, the diamonds are very small) but it looks 'quality' and has a nice subtle shine / sparkle when it moves in the light. Not too showy or pretentious but still classy.Can be dressed up or down depending on other jewelry, but still a good daily mainstay. Love it! And the price can't be beat!\n""]"

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô0, weigh 120 lbs and I bought a medium hoping it‚Äôd be big enough but not ginormous. The sizing is exactly what you would expect from reading all the reviews. The sweater itself is very soft and pleasantly not stuffy at all.

Any smaller and I don't think it would have been long enough.

After about five washes (following instructions), this has lost a lot of softness, even more than the other two brands have. It\'s still good quality but I was hoping the soft inside would remain soft for a while and it didn\'t. That being said, it is still thick and warm.Old review: This is super soft inside and very cozy! I was looking for an oversized fit and found a lot of the reviews were conflicting, so I just sized way up and got a large. I\'m 5\'5"" 110lbs and I wish i got a medium! The super baggy fit is still really comfortable and Im definitely going to keep it but I might order another one in Medium for wearing in public or underneath my jacket, as this large looks more like a weird dress on me and the sleeves are very long. But I\'m cozy!\n', '\n  I bought this as a gift for my father. At first, he and I were both alarmed at how thin it was. I offered to return it, thinking it was just cheap fabric. He decided to keep it anyway and within a few days had called to brag on how warm it was; ""Remember that sweatshirt you got me? It is really light and thin, but boy is it warm! Warmer than any of my others!""  This was only one month ago, so I can\'t testify to how it will hold up in the wash, but for now we are very pleased!\n', '\n  I bought the red sweatshirt especially for Christmas Season. XL size fit me good, thats my normal size.\n', '\n  I usually like my hoodies a bit big to wear with leggings. I am in an XL. It‚Äôs just the right amount of cozy! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and just had a baby. (195lbs) I usually wear an XL shirt so this was perfect. I bought several colors, added my own vinyl, and personalized them!\n', ""\n  Got a 5xl hoping for an extra baggy, long, sweatshirt. I'm 6ft size 3xl female. It's definitely baggy! Love that! It's no longer than a 3xl though which is disappointing. I'll still wear it and love how soft it is, but, I wont be able to wear it with leggings like I wanted.\n"", ""\n  Fits slightly larger than expected, but gets longer, not just wider.(For reference, I am female, 5'8'', 170lbs, and this sweatshirt fits around my 36J chest with room to spare, coming to rest at about crotch level)~ The inside is fleece-y and very soft, though it does pill slightly in the dryer..~ Washes well, but shrank slightly vertically~ The arm cuffs fit snugly while not constricting my man-sized wrists. The sleeves are maybe 2'' too long, which is nice because they can be pulled down to keep my hands warm.~ The neckline is a little bit tight, but not unbearable. It just takes a few minutes to get used to.~ I would call this a medium-weight sweatshirt. It's light enough to wear inside without sweating, and I would also wear it outside down to say 45F.Overall I am very pleased with this sweatshirt. It is cozy, washes decently, and is priced very reasonably.\n"", ""\n  I bought a 2XL so that I could wear it as a dress (I'm 5'5 105 pounds) and it goes to the perfect length on me - Just slightly above my middle finger when my arms are down at my side. When you wear the sweater with a belt, it does become a lot shorter so I do need to wear shorts underneath if i want to do that. The arms are quite baggy but its not a bad look. Overall I LOVE the sweater as it is exactly what I was looking for!\n"", '\n  It fits nicely, it feels warm and cosy, and it looks good (especially under a black leather vest).

The color is authentic to whichever you select, in my case it was dark green because I enjoy looking like a pre-ripened olive. I put it through the washer and dryer on high before putting it on, and it fits well. There is Elastic on the Wrists and Waist, and I think that is quite important if you're trying to keep the cold out. It is a bit thin for a sweater by my standards, but it's not meant to be a heavy sweater. Combine with other Hanes sweaters and hoodies like I did, and you can make a Super Sweater! Take that winter!\n"", '\n  I had to write a review on this sweatshirt because the value for me was primo. The price was outstanding. $10.99 before tax! And with prime I got free shipping. I am so pleased with this purchase that I‚Äôve bought three in total now. FYI -The sweatshirt is definitely a thin sweatshirt but that‚Äôs actually what I wanted was a thin sweatshirt that still had that oversized comfy sweatshirt look that I can wear with tights. I am a female and I usually wear an extra small or small top. I chose the men‚Äôs medium to get that cozy oversized sweatshirt look. It fits EXACTLY how I like and just covers my bum (5‚Äô2‚Äù, 113lbs for reference). I am stoked about this purchase. I love that the sweatshirt is thin because sometimes I get too warm in normal thicker sweatshirts (woodstove in my house). Plus it will be a perfect throw on sweatshirt in summer. It‚Äôs kind of like somewhere in between a cotton longsleeve and a warm sweatshirt in terms of the fabric weight. Hoping they do some other more toned down colours. I got the stonewashed green, the denim blue and the maroon  Those were the only 3 colours I likedüòÜ some reviewers say it seems cheap but it is totally what I wanted and yes it was cheap. So long as you hang it to dry rather than wreck it in the dryer it should hold up well for quite awhile\n']"

But it hinged instead of bending when we fitted it to her finger and it snapped and broke within a month. I ordered her a new one. The second ring broke in the same weak spot, leaving my daughter crying a second time. She wore it gently and with pride...she didn‚Äôt take it on and off, bending it over and over.

All in all it's worth more then 10 bucks to me. 9.6/10(i bought the regular gold and green opal for myself and i love it, everything is on point, and its the correct colour too)\n"", ""\n  It's very pretty but if you have small fingers like me (ring finger is size 4.5) you can only wear it on other fingers.

I am about a size 7-8 on my middle finger and it fit perfect without having to adjust it.  Wore for basically 7 days straight (including to the beach) and did not leave green ring.
