The only thing that I personally don’t like as a console player is the really long wire and that’s only because I have it connected to a controller right in my hands so I had to roll it up and now it is really heavy to a point that I can feel the weight either on my head or on my arms. However much I understand why the wire is the way it is because the headset was made for PC gamers as much as it was Console gamers, that’s my only problem. Overall amazing headset, exceptional sound quality and noise canceling. According to friends the mic quality is really good as well. I cannot stress how comfortable it is, all my other headsets with small ear muffs that settle on my ears rather than around it have always sucked especially since they never really noise cancelled, these fit perfectly around my ears and don’t feel uncomfortable to wear.\n', ""\n  Awesome headset!  For those who say they can't use the mic and sound at the same time, you have to remove the splitter attachment. The single plug should go right into the controller. I went to the Xbox menu and turned up the headset volume. Works perfectly, like complete surround sound audio.\n"", '\n  Amazing headphones, the design and lights are amazing. The places where your ears (I forgot the name) are very big and comfortable. The mic works well, but my friends told me that they could hear my breathing. The mute function works but my friends could hear static when I muted. I wish that they usb chord was longer because i use a mac and with the new one i have to use the 2 ports to charge and connect my mouse so I have to connect to a charger, but to do that I have to put a power strip on my desk. The other thing that i wish would change is the led. Right now the button turns it on and off, but it would be a lot cooler if you could change the color.\n', '\n  Absolutely like this item- my son has multiple devices so he’s able to use it for all. Thanks for the product- it’s worth it.\n', ""\n  The headphones arrived on time and are comfortable. Soft on the ears. The only issue is the USB jack does not fit the new Xbox series x controllers. Not compatible. So headphone won't light up.\n"", '\n  Our son really loves them!\n', '\n  Son is super happy and loves the color!\n', '\n  Dont know why this is suggested for the xbox series x when it is clearly ment for the pc. Its not ment for consol use but amazon suggested it anyway labeling every console. Its better to sell the more comfortable product to suit the gaming environment.\n', '\n  They arrived, box looked like it was already opened and the Mic did not work.Utter cheap rubbish.Please do not give this company your money.\n', '\n  I am so annoyed with this product! It says it is simple just plug it in. My Son has just got an x box series s and we cannot figure out how to get it to work. We have had the mic working, we have also had headphones working, unfortunately just not together. One of the key things I was looking for was that they would both work together, crazy I know. The thing that mainly annoyed me is the lack of user manual or ability to find one on line. I don’t need a video telling me that “This makes the L.e.d’s pop! I need to know what wire goes where? Also don’t expect your L.e.d’s to pop unless you put your face actually in the tv, as the wire is so short. It also doesn’t link to the new x box without a separate adapter. If this is my fault because I have got it wrong, fine. However, the lack of help anywhere is beyond frustrating.\n', '\n  This headset provides the perfect balance for my requirements.I am self employed and currently working from home and this headset has been truly excellent for Zoom meetings during the lockdown. It just looks very, very classy. I often turn off the lights when on a business call using the in-line remote pad which is a nice touch.The headset looks like it could have been bought solely for online video meetings but after working hours when I switch into gamer mode, I don’t need to change headset and can simply turn on the headset lights, dim the room lights and it’s a whole new setting!I can crank the volume up to max without any sign of crackling or interference which is superb and a big plus with this headset. As for the sound itself, it is crystal clear and the noise cancellation just drowns out any background disturbances and immerses you fully into gameplay. Could not ask for more!\n', '\n  My intention was to use this for gaming purposes. Sits comfortably when I’m using it, sound comes through clear and easy to use. Beneficial on the receiving end as well. When I speak, my voice is heard crystal clear and without disruption, the noise cancelling system works a treat. I might use it for work purposes now too!\n', '\n  Love the headset like that my ears are cuffed which blocks outside noise. I only have 1 problem with this headset which is the same problem I have with every headset is that the wire which lights up the headset is not long enough to plug into my game console. I like to sit far and back from my consoles and in order to have my headset glowing I need to sit right up front. Other than that its a solid product\n']"

Furthermore, I did my research and was deciding between Razer, Steelseries and Logitech. Most review websites were raving about the superior sound quality of the Steelseries Arctis 7.Well guess what? The sound is crap. Fresh out the box, I updated the Steelseries Engine 3 software and patched the headset, but the soundstage in my ears was skewed around 30 degrees to the left. That means that everything I hear in my ears seems to be coming from the left. Sometimes, there was nothing to the right. Whether I was listening to music or playing games, the sound was skewed to the left. I tried tweaking different settings in the Engine 3 but to no avail.So I did what any logical person would do -- I contacted the Steelseris customer service on 30 September 2018. Every reply from them takes around 2 - 3 working days. Slow responses notwithstanding, the customer service representative did not seem to know why the issue was happening. He only suggested 2 options.Firstly, he told me to reset the hardware via a magical button hidden in the left earcup. I had to peel off the cushioning, find one of those iPhone pins, and then hold the button for a certain amount of time, at which point the headset should reset. There is no indication anywhere so I had to just hope it worked. (It works when you realise you have to re-pair the headset to the USB receiver that came with it.) After re-pairing with the receiver, the issue was improved by maybe 5 degrees but the soundstage was still skewed to the left. The issue becomes more apparent at lower volumes.The customer service rep's next solution was to go straight to the RMA process. After asking me to send in my receipt, they agreed to RMA the product conditionally if I send in evidence (screenshot) of the destroyed product - i.e. breaking off the left earcup and showing the serial number.Which I did on 14 October.It's 16 October and my reply from them was that my RMA is declined -- with NO EXPLANATION WHATSOEVER WHY.So basically, let's recap -- Steelseries sold me a product that has some weird issue, took 2 weeks to correspond with me, agreed to RMA my purchase, and then after I had destroyed it, proceeded to screw me over and tell me the RMA is rejected.Take this as a lesson learnt -- DO NOT BUY THEIR PRODUCTS. WONKY. FAULTY. PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE. AND WILL ABSOLUTELY SCREW YOU OVER FOR NO REASON AT ALL.\n"", '\n  Okay, these SHOULD be pretty nice headphones for $150, BUT there are quite a few caveats that put me off of these. I noticed a few other reviews mention these issues. These issues bothered me so much I returned them. Simply NOT worth the price!First off, I wear headphones 12-18 hours a day, 7 days a week. For work, recreation, and to help me fall asleep. I know headphones, and have a decent collection of a dozen or so.1) HOLY DISTORTION, BATMAN! Listening to music at volumes any of my other headphones can handle (including the cheap-o $30 bluetooth units), these units produce massive amounts of distortion. I cannot believe how bad these are at volumes over 50%! Give it one tonal range to cover, and it seems to do okay, but toss in two or three (like bass guitar and a high-hat at the same time.... or, ya know, almost all music) and suddenly you can\'t make out what you\'re listening to anymore.2) The volume roller is EXTREMELY easy to accidentally adjust. I mean, unbelievably easy. I am CONSTANTLY messing with the volume when adjusting the headphones or mic, and since it\'s so loose it\'s almost impossible to dial in ""just the right"" volume. Very very annoying!3) There\'s no media controls on these. Why? A push-button volume button combination would easily solve the ""too easy to adjust"" volume, and allow media controls through long presses.4) The ear pieces are EXTREMELY hot. I wear headphones quite a bit, but these burn my ears up in a matter of minutes, which makes me adjust or remove them temporarily. This also reiterates point #2 in that the volume knob is ALWAYS being adjusted by accident.5) These block absolutely no out-side sound, and people often can hear what I am listening to or playing. This doesn\'t make sense since the ear-pads don\'t seem to allow ANY airflow.6) The mic disable button turns ON a light........ What? So when your mic is on, there\'s no light. When you mic is OFF, such as when listening to music, hanging out, whatever, there\'s BRIGHT RED LED on 100% of the time....... Huh???? How does this make sense?7) the audio volume is easily 1/3 of every other headphone I own. I crank every setting up to 100% just to be equal to 30% on any other headset... Why?8) mic is garbage!!!! I can\'t imagine anyone with any sense of intelligence thinking this mic is anything other than painfully sub par. Everything either sounds tinny, or incredibly digital (like using one of those $5 voice oscillators that make you sound like a robot.9) while the ear pads do go around your ears, the speaker mesh is too shallow and will contact your ears. This makes it unbearable by itself, but combined with every other issue.....10) FINALLY the surround sound effect is negligable. Playing the same surround sound tests, I cannot tell a difference between regular 2.0 phones and these. At all. There\'s also a VERY VERY VERY specific place you HAVE to position these, or you\'ll only hear about 70% of what it\'s putting out. Unfortunately the VERY SPECIFIC spot these must be placed is absolutely HORRIBLE. You must bend and fold your ears to position them even remotely correctly.11) I know I said 10 was the final number, but it brings me to another point. These are so uncomfortable in almost every way. After a short session your jaw will hurt, as the bottoms press right into the hinge of your jaw, your ears will hurt and be sweaty from the complete lack of ventilation (it\'s like putting your ears in a wool coat in July in Florida -- a swamp!)From a company that specializes in headphones, these are full of awfully poor design choices! One of the worst overall headsets I\'ve ever owned.Do not recommend to anyone for any purpose!\n', ""\n  The ability to mix chat audio with regular audio using a physical dial on the headset is phenomenal. If you've ever been on a crazy boring t-con, this headset will change your life. You can mix the most life-draining phone call with epic background music. Soul-sucking meetings will cease to drain your life-force. People you wish were dead will become tolerable. It's that good.The quality of the wireless mic is as good as the best wired mics I've heard. Even in an environment dense with devices on 2.4GHz, I get great range.The quality of the speakers is good, but with some tweaking with PEACE (equalizer) the speakers are EXCELLENT. Do a quick search for Arctis 7 eq curves.Comfort-wise, the headset is very easy to wear for long periods. My ears get a little warm, but not sweaty.Battery life is good. I charge it once a week.Honestly.... there's nothing I can be critical of.\n"", ""\n  I've been looking at this headset for a long time due to the fact that I really hated the battery life on my 2015 Astro A50s. When they came on sale for $150 I figured, what the heck. After I received them, I really liked the look and feel of them, sound quality is good, the fact that I can listen to music on my phone is also fun, the wireless range is great; but I must say the mic is not as good as my Astro's (or at least so I am told). The listening experience is fun, but I noticed that the ear cushions were not deep enough as my ears were touching the speakers. At first I thought, no big deal, but after 8 hours... OMG get off my head! These are not comfortable for long periods of wear. I can sometimes have my headset on my head for 15 hours straight, but you have another thing coming if you think I will do it with this level of discomfort.Does this headset deserve a 1 star: No. It's not that bad, but for the money and drawbacks, you can do a lot better; and so I find they are completely not worth your time and money. I hate it when people review a product and say that there is better out there, but then leave it to you to find said product, so I will also say, I bought Razer Naris instead. Wireless range isn't as good, but is very comfortable.\n"", '\n  i dont know where to start with this one.... i bought this to replace my hyperx cloud 2 and was looking for something a bit cheaper. when it arrived it seemed fine but after about 10 mins of use i hated it. It HAS ZERO ADJUSTMENT TO IT comes with only one Velcro spot for the band and the sides dont adjust like most do.  ear cups are not deep enough so my ear is being highly crushed. and now for my big ones.... the audio is absolute garbage worse sounding than apple earbuds and about as loud as well, the ear cups swivel but its not loud enough to hear off your head so thats useless. THE WIRE IS THEN AND MADE OF LOW QUALITY RUBBER AND LOOKS VERY EASY TO ACCIDENTALLY BREAK. literally the only good thing about these headphones is the built in mic and the feeling of boxing it back up to get a refund\n', '\n  I read so many reviews, from Amazon, Eurogamer, and IGN and I was convinced that this would be a good headset... Not the case.Comfort: I thought the ""ski band"" style would be super comfortable, not the case. It\'s decent, but slides off your head and really applies alot of the headset pressure to one small area. Even with the 2019 edition your ears will touch the inside of the headset..Sound: worst part about them. Sounds suuuuper flat. I use hyper x clouds and i thought they sounded flat, but nothing compared to how flat these sound. Plus, max volume with these is not very loud.Mic: no complaints, picks up a fair amount of background noise.Wireless: works great. Wireless adapter seamlessly changes between outputs depending if the headset is on or off. My adapter had an issue and only played left audio.. which led to me returning them.\n', ""\n  Je donnerais 5 étoiles sans hésitation pour le casque si ce n'était du problème que j'ai eu avec les écouteurs blancs.Le son est excellent et le micro est tout autant.Je ne suis pas un fan de la strap d'ajustement pour la tête je trouve ca moins confortable mais ceci peut différer d'une personne à l'autre. Mon plus gros problème avec ses écouteurs est dans son choix de matériaux. Le plastique BLANC utilisé est très poreux et se tache ultra facilement. Et croyez-moi lorsque je dis ultra facilement, mon fils a remplacé ses ecouteurs corsair blanc pour se modèle car le mirco ne fonctionnait plus et il voulait essayer yn noyveau modèle. Il est habitué de jouer avec un oreillé derrière le cou pour un meilleur confort. Avec le casque Corsair, nous n'avons jamais eu aucun probleme, mais le plastique de steelseries est tres poreux et semble absorber la teinture de l'oreillé de mon garçon. Meme probleme si votre ado à l'idée de génie de jouer avec un kangourou et mettre sa capuche sur sa tête en jouant, la couleur de son kangourou a taché ses ecouteurs. J'ai retourné le premier casque croyant à un autre problème mais le résultat est le même avec le 2e. Choissez les steel series noirs afin d'éviter se genre de problème.\n""]"

It works very well on my Xbox, however the headline for product is misleading. The USB audio box(THX) will not work on Xbox. You will need a separate adapter that plugs directly into your controller for the 3.5mm connection. I was under the impression that this headset operated like the Astro Mixamp does where its a USB to mixamp, then mixamp to headset, giving you voice and game audio control. The headset feels great and works very well. I just write this so no one else will feel mislead.\n', '\n  Because I\'m usually listening to music on my phone when I\'m out-and-about, I have a ton of earbuds, so this is the first set of headphones I\'ve ever owned, and I can\'t compare against other headphones, but I love these. I wanted to get one for my computer because I stay up late to work and need my music or movies and don\'t want to wake my family.You do have to use the USB audio controller to get spatial audio by THX (where available). Otherwise , the 3.5mm jack directly inline is only going to give you stereo, so you wouldn\'t get 360 audio plugging this into your phone, for example. I don\'t think the spatial audio works on gaming consoles, just on your PC.Again, as I haven\'t owned any other headsets, I don\'t know how standard the comfort might be, but these are super comfortable. The ear cushions I\'ve tried out a bunch in stores don\'t fit my ears, and I don\'t think I have large ears. I wasn\'t sure about these since they\'re round (usually oval ear cushions fit better), but they completely cover my ears. I\'ve tried previous Krakens in store that didn\'t fit me for some reason, so perhaps they changed something with the size of the cups here, not sure. I wear glasses, and the ""clamp"" of the headphone aren\'t too tight, so I don\'t feel the arms of my glasses pinching me. They are snug enough for desktop use, not enough for street use if you\'re gonna be dancing wearing these or headbanging as they will slide forward or backward with moderate head tilt.The ear cushions do feel cool over extended use. I usually wear these for about 3-4 hours at night, and I don\'t collect any sweat on them. The leatherette is super smooth and feels luxurious.They are not noise canceling or noise blocking. As stated above, they don\'t fit so tightly that you can\'t hear your environment when there\'s no audio, but with a little bit of audio, any noise in your environment is easily drowned out.I like the convenient manual volume control on the cord so that I don\'t have to keep adjusting volume on my computer for different applications or different media. I\'m not a gamer, so I usually leave my mic off (again, convenient integrated off switch), but it\'s nice for teleconferencing with work.Nope, these don\'t light up like other Razer products.You can adjust the sensitivity of noise from the mic in the Razer Synapse 3 Configuration Tool, so you can tune out the keyboard clicking if desired. You can set audio equalizer, adjust mic volume, sensitivity, normalize volume, reduce ambient noise, clarify voice, etc.\n', '\n  This is the first good gaming headset ive bought, the first were sum cheap $25 turtle beach headsets from gamestop, returned those the next day. Then i used my apple earphones until i did enough research and found these. I play call of duty black ops4 and other C.O.D games and its vital to have a good headset, you can hear foot steps directionally from where theyre coming from. Its really a must have for playing the game to your best potential. My K/D went up and overall all experience of the game feels brand new, i had the game 3 months before buying my headset and its a new experience. I recommend spending atleast $100 bux on a good headset and this is the one to get. It has a retractable mic and very good quality, i bought 2 and gave my homie one for christmas and his voice sounds the same in person as it does on the mic, its not high pitched or dry nasal sounding. I get startled everytime i get shot unexpectedly because the quality of sound depth is so good. If your shooting close quarters itll sound loud and if theres shooting in the distance youll be able to hear it just enough and locate it directionally. Also the headset looks pretty hard its all black, and they have cooling gel ear cup cushions that actually feel cool to the touch and very comfortable. The headset is overall very comfortable and has a volume and mute on the headset cord, havent used the THX spatial sound mode but i cant imagine the sound quality getting better honestly. You wont regret getting this headset guarenteed\n', ""\n  Console owners!!!(PS4 and Xbox One) Be advised, the THX function does not work for consoles.  It is only for PC users.  So if you were like me and were debating between these and the Pro v2's, just get the v2's.  Other than that, these headphones are great.  They almost sound as good as my Denon AHD2000 hi fi headphones.  Highly recommend for those not needing wireless or 7.1\n"", '\n  My husband bought this headset at Best Buy, and I bought the next step down of the same brand. Once I tried his and used the remote, I was sold. Best Buy was out of stock, so I came to Amazon. The mic retracts into the headset when not in use, which is great to help prevent damage. It sits very comfortably on my head and ears. Some gaming headsets hurt your head after awhile, but after a 3 hour raid, I felt no discomfort. The sound is excellent, and my guildies said my voice came over perfectly. Very happy with this product!\n', '\n  TLDR; me iría por otro headset más caro.Soy bastante exigente en cuestión de audio y por lo menos esperaba un poco más por parte de Razer en este tipo de periféricos, no son la gran cosa al menos por el precio que los compré ($2k), si lo consiguen más barato seguramente valdrá la pena para muchos.El gel de enfriamiento a veces se nota y otras veces no, el software de Razer Synapse el cual es requerido para que este headset llegue a su máximo potencial o bien funciona o es una pesadilla total.Los drivers también fueron una pesadilla, tuve que reinstalarlos 3 veces porque Razer Synapse hacía cosas muy raras.La manera en que funcionan es la siguiente:Al conectar los audífonos, la computadora automáticamente va a instalar los drivers y te va agregar 3 canales de salida de audio nuevos y una entrada de audio.La entrada de audio como es de esperarse es el micrófono, que a mi parecer no es ni bueno ni malo, bastante regular.Los 3 canales de audio nuevos son los siguientes: Chat, Game y THX.Se recomienda que el canal de THX se ponga en la salida de audio predeterminada para un uso correcto de Razer Synapse, la salida de Chat y Game ustedes deciden en que aplicación o juego será su respectiva salida de audio para manipularlo con el controlador (el cuadrito de volumen THX de los audífonos).Esta funcionalidad en diferentes tareas es sumamente cómoda y eso debo de reconocerlo, antes tenía que hacerlo manualmente en Windows, pero ahora con el headset puedo tener lo que estoy jugando a bajo volumen y el chat a alto volumen y cambiarlo cuando quiera con el controlador, estoy encantado con esta función.Otra cosa, quizá quedes decepcionado por la calidad de audio como yo, prueba estos niveles en el Ecualizador de Razer Synapse y activa el THX desde el controlador.Los números que daré a continuación van de izquierda a derecha en los niveles del ecualizador:4 4 8 0 -6 -3 3 -6 8 8Así al menos tendrás un audio decente en videojuegos y música, para chat este tipo de audio no lo recomiendo.Para un audio más general el ecualizador es el siguiente:2 4 2 0 3 0 5 2 8 6Me parece bastante más cómodo esta configuración para todo.Ya como último, las almohadillas personalmente me parecen muy cómodas, ninguna queja en eso.Espero y haya sido de ayuda, saludos.\n', ""\n  Came in today and was excited to use it.

It will randomly turn off or just not turn on to begin with and in order to fix the issue you have to restart your PC. When it does work it makes the sound quality a lot worse, instead of being able to pinpoint a particular sound it just muffles everything together into one big mess-Cannot use the THX adapter with Xbox as it is USB powered and Xbox does not support USB headsets, you have to use the normal 3.5mm cable that's built into the headset.-Sound quality in general is just not the greatest, the bass is good but you dont get that clear mids and hi's that you can get with other headsets around this price-Headband slightly starts to hurt head after an hour or so of use\n"", '\n  I bought this for my 19 year old boyfriend, and as he is a gamer boy he loves playing games a lot on his xbox so I bought them for him and he has not put them down since I first gave him them!

Por otro lado la constitución física es completamente diferente al Kraken X, en el X cuando usas la rueda del volumen sonaba completamente al dar la vuelta, esta no, además tiene unas almohadillas de gel muy suaves que te mantienen frescas las orejas y no te hacen sudar,  cosa que el kraken tampoco tiene, hablando del RGB es para colores estáticos si esperabas efecto arcoiris, no se puede, pero hasta hoy 2020 dicho por el soporte de razer, no hay auriculares con efecto wave (arcoiris).Estos si son mas pesaditos que los kraken x, pero no son molestos.En resumen si hay MUCHISIMA diferencia física y sonora entre los X y estos, realmente no son lo mismo, estos son muy superiores, por los que dicen que el micro es malo, tambien estan equivocados, con el sofrware de synapse puedes configurar la cancelacion de ruido a tu gusto, claridad de la voz y demás, bastante decente para streamers y videos de youtube, digo tampoco es calidad de un micrófono de estudio, pero su calidad es bastante buena.Como todo lo razer, son excesivamente caros en México, creo que es lo único malo.Mi conclusión es que son unos excelentes audifonos muy diferente a lo que cuenran en internet, y NADA QUE VER con kraken X.Yo los uso en mi streaming y mw sirven muchisimo.En juegos el sonido 360 es ... Sublime, da una ventaja competitiva que hasta parece trampa.\n']"

They are bulky, strong, soft on the ears, beautiful, top quality for the dollar.The sound: It does not oversell the surround sound, you will hear everything from every direction as if you were in the battlefield of the badlands. The quality of sound is beautiful as well, not muffling or diluting despite size, crisp and fresh. Noise cancellation? You\'ll be able to hear enough outside to make sure no one is going to play a game of SAW with you but give you peace of mind. Want more control of volume? No sweat, it comes with a small volume wheel.The mic: Wonderful work of art. Ignores outside sounds (except mechanical keyboard clicks of a certain type, those are loud.) You will be heard clearly, you will be clearly understandable and able to communicate with the most effect compared to other headsets, and is good at making sure only you are heard. Need to insta-mute that mic? It comes with a button that turns it off before anyone can hear what\'s going on.How does it feel? It surrounds and cups the ear, instead of pressing tightly against the tips and giving those horrible headaches. It gives your ears breathing room and the protein foam for the top of your skull is so pleasant that you can easily forget it\'s even there. The mic is comfortable to move around without getting in my way. Out of mind, the only thing you\'ll focus on is the sound blessing your ears. Want to wear it for three days in a row in your chair without visiting the bathroom and having a system of snacks and drinks at your desk for that ultimate WoW session? Go right ahead, it won\'t feel any different than when you put it on to begin with.Will they break easily? NO. These things are built like tanks for your skull, if you drop it, it will brush it off and laugh at the poor attempt to even crack it. This thing might even be a good tool for self defense with how strong it is, these aren\'t poor quality materials.How does it look? It looks like you\'re about to perform an impossible feat on your new favorite game. It\'s beautifully designed, has a red glare that will bring fear into your fellow gaming buddies when you hear their every breath in the game. They are equipped for any situation, they are scary to be against, and highly fashionable to show off and brag to your fellow gamers on Twitch and Steam. They are thick, but that makes this beast seem even bigger and more dominating than those sad little Skullcandy mobile headphones.What can I use it on? If it has either a USB port or can take those little round plugs, congratulations, this works on it. PC is what I use it on, but if I wanted to I could use it on any other single device a gamer could ever imagine using. Even old systems take this beast and let them in, it is perfect.Price vs Quality: Anything that claims to be better will either be a liar or something extraordinarily developed and thus be very costly. This competes with other more costly ""top rated"" headphones. This packs the features, the looks, the comfort, and the durability all for a considerable price that anyone would be right to simply choose this on first sight. I almost was a foolish mortal and thought about others, but no, I made the right choice to take this set and buy it. If it ever breaks I will be surprised and heartbroken. It has improved everything in my games, I cannot possibly appreciate any headphones more than this.You will regret not knowing what beauty is here before you by buying some lame headset for more of a price, because I feel very comfortable that this one will certainly out compete it without a SINGLE QUESTION. Buy it sooner than later, TREAT YOURSELF. I will be getting another for my brother without a doubt.\n', ""\n  Throughout this review, keep in mind that I'm comparing this headset to my brother's $100+ headset. People usually start with the pros, so here are the cons first:CONS:1.) Your ears get warm playing for any length of time which I'm getting used to. In comparison to my bro's headset, the earcups around the ear don't even touch your ear, giving ventilation to the ear to keep it cool.2.) It's wired, which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but the wire is just over 6 feet in length and can get caught on things when you're moving it. Maybe the long wire would be good for the XboxOne (IDK), but for the Playstation 4 all you need to do is plug it directly into the controller, and it automatically connects to the system, so you'd only maybe need half the length that they give you. My bro's headset is wireless.That's it for the cons, as for the pros:PROS:1.)  Comfortable. It's heavily padded around the ears and the top of the headset where it rests on your head. I've worn this for 5 or 6 hours straight, and it still felt extremely comfortable. My bro's headset is similarly comfortable, maybe slightly better, but not by much.2.) The sound is great. My brother's headset claims 3D sound with amazing clarity, but in comparison, I've found that there isn't a great difference (if any!) with this headset and his own.3.) The microphone works crisp, even though I only sometimes hear echos of myself through other people's TV's, I've told they're clear by other players.4.) I've only owned this headset for two weeks, but feels well made, and you can definitely tell they built it smart, even though there's a lot of hard plastic covering the expensive materials, it's sturdy. However, if I were to compare it with my bro's headset, there would be a measurable difference between the two in weight and materials used (on the outside). Like I said, the inside seems like the best part (which is the part that matters, I believe).So, if you're looking for a $28 dollar headset, then get this one. If you're wanting to spend $100+ dollars on a headset, you can find some marginally better in almost every way. Just depends if you want to spend another $80 dollars, or if you want to get a good quality product from a seemingly smart respectable company.\n"", '\n  The product complies with everything the manufacturer promises and the following aspects can be highlighted:1. The headset is quite comfortable, the material of the pads is very soft, which allows them to be used for a long time while the game is going on.2. The headset aid is made of excellent materials, which makes it very robust.3. The cable is long enough, and the volume control gives the user a lot of freedom to raise or lower the volume quickly when needed, without having to pause the game or get too close to the console or PC.4. The maximum volume it provides seems appropriate for long gaming sessions, since the idea is to enjoy the game and not damage the ears.\n', '\n  to keep it short and simple, I play on the Xbox one, I have had zero issues with this headset, no issues or interference conveying my voice or hearing others in a chat, the 50MM magnets work well and I can turn the volume plenty high, and I trust this cable to last, this has been an outstanding value for the $25, I do not see a reason to choose a more expensive headset unless you are more concerned with picking out your style.\n', ""\n  Purchased these because my other headset wasn't working and after reading the reviews on these, I said what the heck. I received them Sunday night and so far they are excellent. The sound quality is really good and the noise cancellation is awesome. They are pretty comfortable as well although they do feel a tad bit heavy but I'm sure I will get used to them. I like the Red Lights on them but I won't be using that at all. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase. You can't go wrong with the price of these for playing video games.\n""]"

Let me start off by saying that the blue glow is amazing. Second the shipping was phenomenal. Came in 2 days which I loved. The next thing is how much noise it canceled out in the background. I love my wife and kids but when I’m gaming this does it all. No more hearing the kids screaming or my wife’s conversations with her girlfriend on the phone. The last thing I want to talk about is how comfortable they are. They don’t hurt my ears and I can wear them for hours with no repercussions. Take them off like I was never wearing them.\n', '\n  I have a week with the headset, I have to say that I am impressed with the sound quality is totally of another level, you will not find anything better for this amount of money also they look great, I am testing the sound when playing The Division 2 and overwatch and perfectly meets my needs\n', ""\n  *Update at bottom*Not too sure how I feel about this headset. I'm always skeptical about new things and only bought this set because my old one finally died and is no longer available on Amazon. With that being said, I likely have a bias with expecting these to live up to my old set. I'll be writing this review as I listen to a playlist with this headset in case my initial opinion changes. Let's start with some first-opinion pros and cons:Pros:-Pretty headset. Colors and style are just like the picture.-Long cord. Twice as long as my old headset. For someone bad with measurements, about two arm lengths.-Cord ends with a USB and 3.5 mm jack. Connected to the 3.5 mm jack is a short two-jack cord in case your device takes two instead of one. This can be easily taken off.-Will be pretty comfortable once broken in. Cushion seems to fall around the ear, so there isn't really any pressure on the ears themselves.Cons:-Left ear sounds a bit more prominent than the right, but that may be because the headset is still tight. When I put the headset on backwards it seemed to sound normal, so it likely just needs time to loosen up (or I'm going deaf).-Sound isn't as forward as my old set or earbuds. It sounds a bit muffled/distanced in comparison.-Kind of quiet. I usually play my laptops volume around 10. With this headset (with the cord on max) I have to turn the volume up to 20 to get the same sound.-USB plugged in alone does not play sound. You have to have the jack plugged in, as well. As far as I can tell, the USB is only for the lights on the head set.-Bass isn't that distinguished.After listening to different types of audio, the muffled sound kind of goes away as the volume is turned up and I can differentiate between more quiet background instruments and louder forward vocals (if that makes sense). But I'd prefer to have that effect without cranking it. I'm a little disappointed that the USB doesn't play audio, but not enough to return the set. I listened to a fan-mashed song that on my old set had me keep the volume down because half of it was louder then the other half. With this set, I didn't have to turn it down as they kind of blended together volume-wise. If I had to choose between this set and my old one (a Sentey gaming headset around the same price) I would chose my old one. But, this will do.*Update*After sending my review to the company, they sent me back a lengthy email either explaining why certain things worked the way they did or how they plan to work on it. I’ve never had a company try so hard to improve customer satisfaction, so I’m bumping my 3 stars up to 4. They’ve even offered to send me an extension cable for the USB just to make up for me not understanding that it didn’t play sound. Although the headset wasn’t exactly how I though it would be, the company has tried hard to fix matters and that means something.*Update 2*1.5 years later and the headset still works like the day I bought it. The ear pads have squished a little bit and start to hurt my ears after wearing it for ~8 consecutive hours, but otherwise it’s fine.\n"", '\n  Fantastic sound quality. Terrific value. Perfect for gaming. Super easy setup and you can clip the cord so it moves with you. Plug-n-play into the Xbox One controller and voila!  Highly recommended this headset!\n', ""\n  I got these because I just needed a headset for gaming. I only paid 20 so I wasnt expecting much but I was blown away by how great this headset was. The fit was really good over the ear on on the top of the head. Idk what material they used for the cusion but it's great because after a few hours of gaming my ears finally got hot. Usually with other headsets my ears heat up fairly quicker and becomes an annoyance to continually wear them. The sound quality was what made everything all worth it though. The surround sound is so legit that it enhances multiplayer shooter and single player RPGs. When playing games like battle field I can hear enemy players run up behind me and it actually sound like the sound is coming from behind me. Its helped a lot of times during pvp matches. For zombie games like state of decay it comes in so clutch because you can hear where the zombies are located and their proximity. Perfect for sneaking around hordes without having to look around. The noise cancellation is pretty good to. Sometimes my wife walks up when she needs something and I can't even hear her walk up until shes right there next to me. Overall I'm very impressed with this product and anyone that rates this product with a bad review has had a bad shipping experience or is just a negative person.\n"", '\n  I bought this hoping it was an either/or setup for the 3.5mm audio jack vs. the USB port.  It is not.  This is not a USB headset.  All the USB port does is provide power to the blue lights in the headset.  This headset requires a 3.5mm audio jack for both the headphones and the microphone.Edit:  I have updated my review and added another star.  The headset is functionally fine.  My disappointment is that the description is not clear on the input connectors.  All the USB jack is for is to provide power to the LEDs in the headset.  This headset requires 3.5mm jacks for the speakers and the microphone.  It is not a USB headset.  Seller should update their description and specifications making this clear.\n', ""\n  I got these headphones delivered back in June, 2019. Bought solely for PS4, been playing Black Ops 4 most of the time and I Love them. Specially when playing Blackout solo you can definitely hear footsteps and your surroundings. Mic works perfect too, most time I play my girl is sleeping so I gotta keep it quiet, talking low I've never had somebody said they can't hear me. Dropped them from the couch a few times they still working perfect. I've used them to talk on the phone occasionally when I'm playing and somebody randomly calls.\n"", '\n  Purchased this headset to use within X-Plane 11 to practice instrument flight procedures to keep myself current during lockdown. Still waiting for the controls to arrive so the picture shows the headset connected to a MacBook Pro as a temporary solution.Sound quality and comfort seem excellent and a test with Skype reveals a very high quality of input via the mic.I\'m not a gamer so need a headset that will cause minimum distraction and discomfort and be most similar to the in-cockpit epxerience of working with an aviation headset. This gaming headset meets those criteria admirably.The only issue so far is that the jack and USB plug are close together and I can\'t put the USB into the ""C"" ports on the MacBook Pro. I had to find an extension to be able to plug both in at the same time (see photo). A minor gripe but a USB C plug option would bring the headset up to date.\n', ""\n  Did some research prior to buying a new gaming headset. I wanted one that was affordable but with good audio quality and possible surround-sound - this headset matches exactly what I wanted. I'd be surprised if you could find a better one for the low price. Is the surround-sound the best available? No, but I wasn't expecting it to be. I could spend £200 on a super high quality one, but I'd much rather spend £30 on a headset that still does the job and sounds good. 5 stars for quality in relation to the price.\n"", '\n  It is a present for my son who is really happy with the mic sound and the RGB. It is confortable and the headset looks good. They also light up. He can hear better than with his other headset which were more expensive. So happy with my purchase.\n', '\n  My favourite part of the headphones is the shape, design and material which covers the ears - it is really comfortable.  Really easy to set up and use.  The colour is really vivid and goes well with my other gaming station LEDs.  Hoping the product also proves reliable, as really pleased with the initial performance.  Would highly recommend!!!\n', '\n  Very comfortable over ear headphones.Sound quality is fair for the price.Microphone seems to work well, with no complaints from my colleagues.Like the split lead giving you a choice of USB or headphone jack connection.\n']"

I absolutely love it. I hope my video review is helpful to you!~ :)EDIT: I noticed a lot of people forget... please make sure you're PLUGGING the cable ALL THE WAY IN! ^_^\n"", '\n  This was my very first HyperX Product. I was pretty hyped up to receive these! Unfortunately I did not like them at all. While they work great, the comfort is horrible. I have an average sized head and I feel like these are not able to extend enough. On top of that, you can feel the audio drivers on your ears constantly when wearing, which is an extremely hard and uncomfortable feel and the headset feels tight on my head, giving me headaches whenever I wear them. I tried contacting their support about this issue and they said they would send ""new"" earpieces right away. Upon receiving them, they were the exact same ones I had. I tried to open that case back up, but he strongly claimed they were different and basically would no longer help me.All I could find online is that the person either had to purchase new earcups (Not their brand) or they doubled up on the ear pads, meaning they put 2 pairs inside each other so you wouldn\'t feel the audio driver. Sadly, even though I don\'t feel those terrible drivers anymore, the headset is even more tight on my head. I have a beating headache whenever I use them.If you look it up, many people are having this problem.I am sad to say that with my first HyperX product, I had all these issues. As of this moment I\'m not sure if I will look to them for another purchase. At this point it\'s just as if I paid for something to give me a headache, both figuratively and literally.\n', '\n  This headset has a lot of goods going for itself, especially at this price point - decent sounding headphones, detachable cables and mic, solid build quality, and extremely comfortable even with my extra large head. I was left disappointed, however, when it came to use with PS4 despite it sounding fine on PC. When I connected it to my PS4 controller I was treated to a set of headphones that was too quiet. After doing some research I found out this headset has an impedance rating of 65 ohms, and that the PS4 controller does not have enough power to drive the thing. Whose problem is it to fix, Sony or HyperX? Regardless, while this is a great headset, it does not work well enough out of the box with a PS4 like the product description claims.\n', ""\n  I tired many headphones Astro A40, A50, AKG 7XX, Sony gold headset and planutain. I got this just now. Once I open it and try it on I felt this headset are light and bit tight on ears. I feel no pain on ears or head level however this headset are so good that can beat the other headphones I owned. No joke Astro does have great sound but their headphones are heavy and won't feel comfortable after 3 hrs of gaming. I wear glasses to play so it will be a bit difficult. The bass and sound are great however if you guys want to boost up the sound on a console I suggest u have to buy an amp like astro to increase the sound if you willing to spend more I will go with Sound blaster X7. Have a good day reading I hope my words are helpful to anyone going to buy gaming headset. And once again thanks for reading😂😁\n"", ""\n  I have had these Cloud Alpha headsets now for about 3 weeks and have nothing but great things to say.... well maybe one minor gripe; the ear cups.  However, a quick upgrade to the Brainwavz (red velour) ear cups have made a 200% difference in comfort!  You barely even feel the headsets and they are still tight enough to feel solid on your head.I have been using Astro A40s since 2013 and have often used some of my audiophile headphones when I wish to not use a microphone.  Thus, I've never been truly happy with the A40 sound.  They are muffled and lack fidelity and presence.I tried these new Cloud Alphas and wow.  Immmediately impressed with them all around. Great construction, feel, and sound.  The mic sounds amazing... they absolutely kill the A40's mic; makes them sound like cheap $3 microphones.  The A40s sound anemic compared to these headsets. I will never go back to Astro, accept for using their TR Mix Amp Pro; which when combined with these headphones I believe make the perfect mid-range <$250 headset combo.  I have a background in audio recording so my ears now good sound.  Get these headsets; you won't be disappointed.  Spend the extra $20 and upgrade the earcups and you'll be hooked on the sound.\n"", '\n  \xa0Son los segundos audífonos para gaming que adquiero, los primeros fueron uno gold headset de sony, y debo decir que los HyperX Cloud Alpha son excepcionales en comparación aparte de ser mucho mas durables por su estructura de alumnio, el sonido es claro y nítido, donde al jugar podemos escuchar claramente donde provienen los sonidos, los probe con Forza 7 y con Doom, en Forza el audio te ayuda a envolverte mas en la experiencia de conducción, ya que puedes como dije, escuchar la fuente del sonido, por ejemplo al poner la cámara de la perspectiva del conductor, claramente puedes escuchar como el sonido de frenado y derrape de las llantas provienen de abajo, como si realmente estuvieras manejando dentro de un automóvil de carreras, en Doom que puedo decir, simplemente el sonido de la atmósfera te hace mas sentir la emoción al jugar, y mas cuando acabas con los demonios con los rugidos de tus armas.Los audífonos aíslan muy bien el ruido exterior, para que nada te saque de la inmersión de tus juegos, y uno de los puntos mas fuertes, es que son super cómodos, con lo cual puedes jugar horas y horas sin que te cansen o te lastimen las orejas como otras que hay en el mercado de menor calidad. Ahora hablando del micrófono también es bueno, es claro, evita que tus amigos escuchen ruidos, cumple con su cometido a esa hora de hacer las salas de juego y platicar y divertirte con tus amigos, ademas que es removible lo cual los hace muy prácticos.Son unos audífonos geniales que no puedo mas que recomendarlos totalmente, por su calidad, por su precio, los convierten en una compra de la cual no te arrepentirás. Les dejo un vídeo y unas fotos que realice de los audífonos para que las puedan apreciar.\n', '\n  Mis respetos para HyperX, quienes entregan una calidad mejor a la esperada por el cliente (debido al precio), se siente que tengo un producto el doble de caro. Son mis primeros audífonos para gaming y ya los amo, los utilizo en Xbox one y en PC para jugar pubg, me gustan mucho los juegos FPS y la verdad es que se incrementa bastante  la experiencia de juego, nunca pensé necesitarlos tanto. Los recomiendo sin duda.Actualización después de 10 meses de uso:El único pero que les pongo ( y es un detalle muy importante que pasaron por alto los diseñadores) es que no tienen almohadilla dentro de los auriculares, por lo que tú oreja está en contacto directo con el metal de la bocina, a las 2 - 3 horas te empiezan a doler las orejas y tienes que descansar, lástima que se les haya escapado ese detalle, lo noté desde un inicio pero pensé que era normal y que me acostumbraría ya que son mis primeros audífonos.\n', '\n  This headset is genuinely great for £119.99 however its HyperX who are limiting its potential?As a predominantly PS4 gamer I\'m disappointed of the lack of hardcoded mic monitoring to the USB DAC that\'s included that companies like Logitech and SteelSeries offer. However, the sound quality (When not activating the genuinely laughable ""7.1 Surround Sound"" feature) is by far and away the best due to the high quality drivers and closed back cups. It seriously baffles me that no profiles actually save to the DAC? This is due to the software that accompanies the headset called ""HyperX NGENUITY"" which I should note is technically still in Beta. However its so so poor, you cant adjust any settings for sound profiles using a equaliser.... or do any detailed changes for that matter.I find with this headset that its a simple case of 1 step forward and 2 steps back. The lack of hard coded mic monitoring to the DAC for PS4 which other companies offer, The tinny sounding 7.1 surround sound with next to no base with the sliders on the cups being on max and finally the overall poor software that accompanies the headset in terms of customisation.In all its a headset that\'s worth £70 max when looming at where it sits in the market and I would heavily advise the overall far superior experience from SteelSeries!\n', '\n  Bought this as a Christmas gift for someone who has already been using the Hyperx Clouds, though there really was not much difference between the two apart from the price.Bass adjusting feature: The bass adjusters did nothing - there was literally no difference.Noise cancellation: this was actually pretty good to be fair, definitely better than the clouds in that regardDesign: I purchased the blue pair and I have to say that this was probably the best feature, the blue looks really cool and I wish they did this colourway on their other headsetsComfort: can’t complain, classic hyperx comfortPrice: overall, it really is not worth spending about £80 more on a headset that does not differ much from hyperx’s older versions for about £30. Either go save yourself some money and buy the Cloud version or try out something different, it’s not worth that much\n', '\n  Mic is very poor the volume levels make it hard for people to hear you.

I have yanked these things off of my desk to be flung to the floor or hang by the cord and not once did it do anything to damage them and i blame this on the cord length3)i wish the cord was longer but ill just buy a extension because when i go to get up i set my headphones on my desk and somehow the cord hangs off in my seat and i don't see it when i go to sit down and it sends my headphones flying every time i'm actually writing this review because 5 mins ago my headphones got flung off and picked them up to see they were fine and put a smile on my face thinking about all the hate these headphones got so i wanted to write this review4) my ears re not huge but there above normal size and i could wear these for hours back to durability and comfort i have fallen asleep with these on having the headphones only on one ear there just that good and there slim they feel awesome and i have woken up to find them on the floor, no i'm not trying to abuse them i'm just so confident they wont break and the sound quality and comfort keeps these on my head whenever i'm at the house.2 Year Update hope your reading this BretAfter owning these for nearly two years, i have to say that these things sound as amazing as the day i bought them.  They have held up really well with no cable kinks, no loss of the rigidity to the comfy ear muffs, and no stretched out head band.  Most of the negative reviews talked about the plastic being cheap and breaking off, this isn't the case with mine.  Still to this day from my original review i wear these nearly everyday because i started online school when the pandemic happened.  I hardly ever play games anymore with school and work, but while using these for music 6+ hours a day i couldn't be happier with the sound quality.  I still have not bought the extension like i said i would and yes these still get flung around.  If your looking for cheap headphones you will not be dissatisfied with these i promise.\n"", ""\n  This is a great headset.  The sound is clear and the microphone works well and blocks out all of the outside noise.  It is very comfortable to wear, even with glasses.  I'm probably most impressed by Corsair's customer service though.  After only two months and zero use after my initial set-up testing, the microphone just didn't work.  I found the number for customer service online and called to see if they could help me troubleshoot.  The automated answering system only asked me one question to direct me to the correct place and I was only on hold for about 15 seconds before a tech support person was on the line.  When I explained the issue and told him I was running Windows 10, he immediately knew what the problem was and walked me through the steps to fix it.  As it turned out, Windows had a recent update that automatically changed the privacy settings to disable access to the microphone from all of the installed apps.  All I had to do was enable access and now my microphone is working again.I will definitely use Corsair products as much as possible and I recommend them to everyone.\n"", '\n  I\'ve been looking for a new headset ever since and have kept my eye on this Corsair HS60. I finally decided to buy when I saw it went down to $49.99! Best decision I have made. The sound quality is probably the same as the Kraken Pro V2, with the major draw for this headset being the advertised 7.1 surround sound. When listening to music or games the base is good and sound is sharp. My friends love how clear this headset is when I use this to talk, no static or background noises! The build of the headset is very solid having an aluminum feeling band and outer ear cups, so I\'d assume this headset will be very durable. What caught me by surprise was the actual ear cups, they appeared to be shallow and I worried about it being too small or uncomfortably tight, however to my pleasure they were soft and deep enough for my ears to sit comfortably within! Also the top of the headband has a nice ""braided"" leather cushion to keep it from digging into your head. Headset comes with a handy USB adapter if you want to use the headset for the PC which I mainly do, much appreciated!Only downsides to this headset would be that even though the ear cups are nice and comfortable for me it\'s kind of just the right size for my ears. Like there\'s no extra space for my ears and it kind of feels like my ears get warm when wearing this headset as there isn\'t as much airflow. Another complaint is that the volume control and mute button are on the back of the left ear cup which is a strange position to have it at. A couple times already when putting on the headset I would accidentally mute or lower my volume all the way and be confused for a bit as to why no sound was playing back or my friends wouldn\'t respond.  Also something minor, but to fully use the functionality of the 7.1 surround sound on PC you need to go to the actual corsair website and download the driver for this headset. Which some people might have missed out on if they didn\'t take the time to read the instructions.I previously used the Razer - Kraken Pro V2, which was a hand-me-down from a friend. I loved how comfortable the large ear cups were and the sound was loud and clear. However, my friends would mention the mic would sometimes be oddly static-y at times and even had this weird sharp sound coming from it whenever I would talk. Keep in mind the Razer Kraken Pro V2 only has a 3.5mm headphone jack for both the mic + headset. I had to use a USB adapter in order to fully use the mic functionality with that headset.Comfort - 4/5Sound - 5/5Mic - 5/5Ease of use - 4/5 (once driver is installed, just have to plug in usb and works fine)\n', '\n  Corsair\'s HS60 Pro Headphones do not provide driver support. The site has been down for over a week for ""maintenance"" while the support staff claims it\'s up. (Cleared my cookies, caches, etc.) Their site does not work and you cannot get drivers. Their headset is not supported by Realtek audio so you can\'t toggle between that and your speakers. You also can\'t make adequate sound adjustments. They sound too quiet for stereo headphones (a problem I think that would be rememdied with proper drivers and support software which you can\'t get.)  I don\'t recommend these at all.\n', ""\n  Was trying to figure out whether to buy the Steelseries Arctis 3 or the Corsair HS60's s I bought both.  After trying both I found that the sound quality of the HS60 to be far superior and the mic quality better.  The ear cups are great.  They are plush enough yet firm enough to keep your ears from bottoming out.  I also like that they are plain looking so they don't make your head look like a Christmas tree with leds all over the place.UPDATE 1 Year later: Been a year since I bought these and still working great.  Wore these pretty much daily for 5 hours minimum per day.  Still comfortable on the ears though I did puncture one of the pads with a rough sharp fingernail a week ago.  My fault but it means they will begin to shed faster. May buy another pair as a spare set.\n"", '\n  Como dice el titulo, los audifonos son excelentes, y se ven de muy buena calidad, no se ven baratos o corrientes sino al contrario profesionales. La calidad del audio es muy buena, no he tenido problema con esto. Para poder utilizar el 7.1 se require una PC con el software de iCuE (que no es tan bueno pero cada vez lo hacen mas estable). El microfono segun el feedback que me han dado suena muy bien, casi no hay distorsion de voz (quizas ligeramente mas aguda pero en realidad es poco perceptible).Los uso tanto para gaming como para el trabajo, en reuniones remotas no tengo problemas con estos y durante las sesiones de juego tengo buena calidad. No son pesados asi que no cansan, he estado con ellos cerca de 10 horas puestas constantes y no sientes el peso ni cansancio por usarlo. La tela es fresca asi que no estas sudando y yo que uso lentes no he tenido problemas de que sean incomodos (en comparacion de muchos otros que lo son cuando usas lentes).Corsair me ha resultado excelente, sus productos han salido muy buenos y no son tan caros. Puedo decir que ya soy fan de la marca.\n', ""\n  While it worked this was a good headset, sound quality and features as expected. However, I purchased from the global store without realising you don't get a warranty on the product. I ordered on the 12th Jan and the returns closed on the 23rd Feb. Which was just after the product was delivered. The headset mic stopped working after 6 months and had to replace with another product which worked perfectly.  Maybe worth considering from the UK Amazon store or another retailer.\n"", '\n  Los compré principalmente porque mucha gente decía que el audio era increíble. Al probarlos tienen un audio muy saturado y en juegos de battle royale los pasos son difícil de escucharse y los disparos se escuchan muy saturados. Son muy bonitos, buen diseño y son cómodos pero a fin de cuentas lo que importa es el rendimiento y el diseño solo es un plus. En calidad-precio es un 2/5 porque unos audifonos de 2000 pesos mxn no debería de tener ese sonido.\n', '\n  I use this for flight simulator and the sound quality especially of the aircraft engines and the ATC instructions are very clear.  The cable length is excellent with plenty of slack. Looks fantastic with my Corsair keyboard, mouse and mat.  Must save up for the RGB headphone stand.\n']"
