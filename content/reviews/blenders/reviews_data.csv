However, there are a couple of design flaws. Small amounts of liquid shoot out of lid and it does not blend things very well.  The unit has a few programs that run automatically as well as pulse features. The programs start with a few pulse blends before going full throttle. During the pulsing, liquids are pushed all the way to top of the lid and small amount of liquids shoot out. Also, some combination of the blades and wideness of the container create very chunky blends. I'm not happy with this and intend to return it.\n"", '\n  Graduated from an decade old programmed Oster blender to this when the older one stopped working consistently. This is an OK blender, blends fine. The plastic chassis seems a little cheap and thin over the traditional thick black plastic of all the older Oster blenders I’ve had. The smoothie cup is helpful.This model has a safety latch on the blade base that prevents the glass or cup from coming unseated from the the base during blending. Never seen one of these before but it works fine on the glass pitcher, easy to screw on. Unfortunately the smoothie cup isn’t designed as well and you can easily think you are screwed on tight but actually it’s loose. The pitcher has the latch stops designed with slight angles so the latch is pushed up over the stop as your are screwing it on. The smoothie cup doesn’t have the angles so if you don’t pay close attention, the latch could hit one of the stops and fool you into thinking the base is on tight. We already had one moderate mess from that design flaw.The automatic settings are sort of mysterious to me. The older Oster blender had several presets that once pressed, would run and then stopped. This model, for example, has three “smoothie” settings when activated do slightly different routines but then go into a perpetual blend mode and don’t stop. Perhaps I haven’t waited long enough but quite frankly if your smoothie isn’t done after 2 minutes I don’t know what I’ve been doing wrong all these years.\n', '\n  Product does not handle ice well at all.

The demo videos were great, most reviewed were great. I couldn’t have been more disappointed I don’t think. First I arrive home to find it sitting in my front porch in plain view of anyone who drives by (as always) but the problem was it was not revised. So everyone could see there was a NutriBullet sitting in my front porch. Second, it came via UPS. They are notorious for rough handling of packages so my purchase was not protected from the physical abuse of UPS. It was scuffed up and corners dinged in. Fortunately the unit inside was not damaged. So in summary of these issues, product not shipped in amazon box which protects it physically and doesn’t advertise for hthe neighborhood what I bought. Now the third issue is the product itself. Cheap. Doesn’t blend well. Bounces around in the counter as it’s blending. I used 1 cup of milk, 1-1/2 cups frozen fruit chunks and a 1/2 scoop of protein powder. That didn’t take up much space in the cup. The instructions do say to fill to the max line with liquid. I was making a smoothie for myself, not a whole family. So, it spun and spun just the bottom part. Then the thing would jump as another piece of fruit slid down into the blades. This went in for several minutes before it finally had all the contents whirring around as it should. So now it’s done and I have a giant cup not even half full, pop a lid on it and go. I ordered this to replace my Ninja that quit working. I plan to send the Nutribullet back and get another Ninja.  The Ninja cup was about 14 ounces or so, and my smoothie was ready in a matter of about 30 seconds or less. The unit had suction feet so it didn’t bounce around on the counter. This was my first and last NutriBullet. NEVER again.\n', '\n  The unit is way to fast. At first I thought this was normal but after a couple of weeks the rubber below the blades started to rip appart.The cup contact ears broke within a month.\n', ""\n  I really like my NutriBullet Pro and have made a number of great smooties.  I did get some leaking early on, but once I reversed the order of ingredients from what the book recommends I had NO more problems.  The instruction say to shove the green stuff in first with frozen items and ice on top, but you're flipping this thing over!  When I loaded as recommended, the frozen items gave it a hard time and the greens stayed up in the top.  Numerous stops, shakes, and re-starts caused the leaking!  I put frozen items in first, then layer on fruit, yogurt, greens, then a few ice cubes on top - works great!  Pulverizes everything, including whole almonds.  Make sure the lid is tight especially if you stop and re-start, or pulse.  Afterwards, the lid can be a bit difficult to remove but not a huge problem.  Experiment!  Some smoothies look pretty gross, but taste good nevertheless.  I definitely did NOT need all these parts - will probably never use the flip top lids or handle attachments.  The blender cup is large, and I just pour everything into a different glass.  Save your money on that one.  The book was useless and is just a big advertisement.\n"", ""\n  Unit arrived in good order, but I believe the NutriBullet Company's products are made cheaply compared to what they were just a couple of years ago.  I tried my new unit yesterday and I do know that you have to seal the blades onto the plastic glass container rather securely.  I did.  However, quite a bit of my drink ended up leaking out and dripping down into the motor housing...what?!!?  I'm not a weak person, and I do know how to secure the unit prior to mixing a smoothie...but it leaks, simple as that.  Totally unacceptable, not to mention somewhat dangerous - I imagine.  Returning item for refund.  NutriBullet needs to use much more effective gasket, I guess.Roger\n"", ""\n  We've given this a good shot and we're not happy. We had the original NutriBullet and used it every day. We decided to upgrade to the better model and it is SO, SO Loud you need to leave the room when it's running, not to mention it unscrews the base from the container making a mess. We actually think there might be something wrong with this specific one, but can't figure out how to exchange it through Amazon. We'd like to try a different one and hope ours is just defective. If not, then we would prefer to go back to the original model.\n"", '\n  This is my third NutriBullet, and I am very displeased with the NutriBullet Pro.  I purchased it to make Bullet Proof Coffee every morning for my husband and I.  It has leaked 10 out of the 12 times I have it.  It leaks so badly that the motor smells like it is going to burn up.  I have tried everything to keep it from leaking, including having several other people look at it to see if I was doing something wrong with the device.  Do not buy this model.  Something has to be wrong with it when you take it out of the box and it leaks immediately.  I will be contacting Customer Support about this model.  I will return it and buy another model if that is possible.\n', ""\n  THE NUTRIBULLET STOPPED WORKING TODAY.  THERE IS AN INHERENT DESIGN FLAW.

The included ""Nutribullet Pocket Nutritionist"" and ""Blasting For Optimum Health Recipe Book"" are absolutely pathetic!

Love this thing... especially for the price.Edited to add: I've seen a lot of people complaining that it doesn't blend all the ingredients, gets stuck, requires stirring, etc. I've found that when this happens to me, it's usually because I didn't add enough liquid to compensate for the solid ingredients. I just pop the top and pour in a little more - water, milk, whatever - and it solves the problem right away.

I use it to make pudding, puree split pea soup, and some drinks and it's really a good blender. It surprised me how much better it does the job than my Cuisinart! I love the pouring spout on top as sometimes it was messy pouring from the corner of my old one. I've owned this for a while now. I don't like reviews from folks that do it right out of the box. I like to use the product for a while to test it out. This one definitely passed.\n"", '\n  This is the second time we have bought the blender. We thought the first one was a fluke.  I did research and the description states that it crushes ice and frozen fruit.It does crush ice and frozen fruit. However, after about a month the motor burned out. We tried a second as the manufacturer said that was a  malfunctioning blender and the same thing happened. No amount of extra liquid helps. It doesn’t even crush it well. Unless, if you count it leaving big chunks of uneven pieces.If you’re really looking for something where you need frozen fruit or ice crushed I would spend the extra money to get something that actually works. I will be speaking to the manufacturer on this one as well because it is doing the same thing as the last.I would not mind at all if they did not say it was specifically for crushing ice and fruit etc. ( in the description of the item )So beware, I would hate for you to have to go through what I have went through with burning out motors after just a few uses.\n', '\n  The collar of this blender (the piece that holds the blade and screws the pitcher to the base) broke within two months. I probably used the blender 10 times. I called the customer service department which took a while to get a hold of, and they were not very helpful.  The representative asked me what did I put in the blender.  I told her ice, almond milk, flax seed oil, and 6 frozen strawberries.  She asked did I thaw out the strawberries first, and I said no.  She then informed me that I should let the strawberries thaw first.  Hmmmm.  It did a fairly good job of blending my morning smoothie before the collar broke, now I do not have a working blender.\n', '\n  I have only owned 4 Hamilton Beach Blenders in 25 years. The last HB Blender, a housewarming gift lasted four months.  This one I purchased last June but used less than half a dozen times.  It has been a disappointment for all my smoothies, and I do not dare use it for any other processing.  The part labeled collar is open and performs as a trap for food particles to lodge at the bottom of the glass jar below the cutting blades.Nut, Fruits, Vegetables, Seeds, and Ice are trapped never participating in the remaining blending process.  After cleaning, those particles are usually still trapped until they are sorted and individually picked out.I do not recommend.\n', ""\n  I bought this blender two years ago, mainly to make smoothies and occasional milkshakes. It was used, on average, once a day for less than five minutes. It was excellent for what I wanted and had a design which greatly helped the blending process without need for constant stopping to get unmixed material down to the blades.  After about a year it started leaking and I discovered that the plastic 'nut' that attaches the blades to the glass jar had cracked. I tried to repair it with different adhesives but nothing worked.  Thinking I had just been unlucky with the first one I purchased a second of the same model. It worked just as well as the first one until the same problem occurred. Now I was a little upset and so I submitted warranty claims for both to HB. They accepted the claims and agreed to send replacement parts but with a charge of $6 for S/H for each. I replied asking them if they would guarantee the replacement parts without charging for anything if they failed (since I suspected a manufacturing problem in general with that part) and have heard nothing back, which I take as a 'no'.  Too bad--I'm now using an Oster which is supposed to be pretty bulletproof. It's OK, but I liked the HB better, except for the leaking part.\n"", ""\n  I was really disappointed in this purchase. It barely blends fruits especially if they are frozen. You''ll have to pause the blending midway and stir. I noticed that the blender cup was hard to pull out of the base and today the piece got stuck and came apart leaving me with a smoothie all over my counter. JUST A WARNING.\n"", ""\n  Don't you love the lovely sound of construction workers drilling holes in the ground at 6 am in the morning? NO? Well me neither. And this blender sounds a lot like that.

AWFUL!!!!!!!!!I didn't like that all the ninja blenders where plastic so I decided to get something different this time .. something made out of good old fashion glass. And that is the only part I liked about this blender. So I guess its just me because everyone loves this blender.\n"", ""\n  I've used this blender more or less on a daily basis with frozen fruits and vegetables for about two months. I knew that I would be getting a lot of use out of it, and have had experience with both low end blenders (always disappointing) and high end blenders (from working at a smoothie making business), and was a little bit hesitant to purchase one at this price point, rather than investing in a higher end, more powerful one.However, I was happily surprised by both the quality and easy of use of this blender. It has a very solid glass jar (I've had bad experiences with cracks in the jars of cheaper plastic blenders). It also comes apart for easy cleaning and can go in the dishwasher. It's so easy to clean and used so frequently in my household that I rarely need to put it in the dishwasher unless I'm in a rush. The motor may not be as powerful as some more high end blenders, but as long as you make sure to start with a liquid base, it has no trouble blending frozen foods.The only caveat that I have is that, about a month into use, my unit started leaking. At first, I thought it was because I was putting it back together incorrectly, but then I noticed a small crack in the plastic/rubber ring in the cutter assembly. After wondering how difficult it would be to get the part replaced, I continued using it for a few weeks, but finally made the call to the Hamilton Beach office in Canada today.The real reason that I had to post this review was the pleasant and quick service that I got while making that call. All I had to do was give them the product model/series and describe the part that was affected. There was no fuss about proof or purchase or anything else. The new part is free because of the 3 year warranty and they charged me $5 for shipping (which I knew I would be paying anyway because of the clear warranty policy). It should arrive within 7-10 days. When you purchase a product that is not so high end, you sometimes worry about the service that you'll receive if any problems come up. I will not hesitate to purchase similar products from Hamilton Beach in the future if they have such an easy to access warranty service.\n"", '\n  After less than 3 months the blades completely fell off randomly and my protein shake went all over the stove.\n', ""\n  I got this yesterday and have used it a few times.

First from 2012.12, second one 2015.06. Now it's 2017.02. Both time, got burnt motor after frequent/daily usage. First time, the plastic bottle also cracked and started a little leaking. I was pissed off that the motor on my second one burnt off again, lasting even shorter than the first one. But to be fair, I do use it almost every single morning for my green thickie. This Hamilton is definitely not the most powerful. By only crushing small ice-cubes and careful pulse motion with plenty liquid, handled by a very experienced user, the motor burns out every two years or so.Yet I keep coming back. Because it's cheap, does the job, easy to use and to clean. I've tried other two popular blenders from Amazon in the past (Ninja and Epica I believe), but no. At least for my purpose of making green thickie and occasional almond milk, this cheapest Hamilton Beach simply beats all the other cheap blenders so far. I like the design, large mouth for easy pouring-in of oats, liquid. It stands up instead of upside down which makes adding more greens or liquids while operating easier. Once I got the hang of it, it actually never spills, and only takes a rinse to clean. It's part of the reason my breakfast-in-a-rush stays the same thing for almost four years...It does have a burnt-chemical smell, especially when it's new. Mines don't have the smell anymore after several days usage. It does still smell if I venture to press it on hard ice or frozen fruit for too long (which I don't do very often, even though I do love banana-icecream. I can still make them but do have to remember to leave the frozen bananas out for 10min or so before crushing them, and even then, I need to be very patient).In hind sight, I could've gotten those three-year warranty back at the first purchase, probably saves some bucks. But what can I complain?! With $15*2 it has served me four years.  That probably amounts to a thousand times usage!One star off for the burnt-chemical smell which I always somehow associate with potential cause of cancer, another for the very weak motor and the plastic build. But I do love it. Wonder how long the third one will last me. I really hope the company is not going further cheaper on the motor quality.That's a long hell of a review\n"", '\n  I wanted something that could make me a one person smoothie away from home and after looking at several of these types of blenders, comparing prices and reading the reviews, I settled for this one. I have been using it everyday for the last 3 weeks and it has met all my expectations, and more. I have a, Nutri-Blender(Bullet) at home that I am accustomed to using and one of my concern with the, Hamilton Blender was, if it would be able to blend all the fruits combined with things like; beets, ginger, carrot, and mainly the nuts. Well, it has been doing so successfully. Just remember that blenders were meant to be ran in short intervals of about 30 seconds, giving the motor a break, of at least 1-2 minutes, allowing it to cool off or it will definitely burnout, the  Hamilton Blender is no different. If you use it correctly it will perform as expected.\n', '\n  ➕I pulse the pulse button (off & on button motion) some ppl have recommended it so you don’t kill the tiny motor➕YOU CAN NOT PUT ANY HOT LIQUIDS IN THIS BLENDER IT SAYS THAT REPEATEDLY IN THE USER MANUAL (it’s a plastic cup it can’t handle that kind of heat of course like most plastics it would eventually break or crack  if you continuously put hot liquids in it people let’s think)➕ it does crush ice and frozen fruits➕super easy to clean I wasn’t sure how clean this blender would get since you can’t detach the blades but it definitely does get cleaned pretty well as long as you don’t let whatever you blended seat and dry up in the cup...add some water and dish detergent and let it soak for a few mins➕for the price and the tiny motor that this thing has I’m surprised at how great this blender performs it took me less then 8 minutes to make my smoothiesAll and all if you’re looking for something to cheap and good quality to make your quick smoothies or protein shakes then this might fit the bill for you it definitely does for me❗️\n', ""\n  I truly love this blender!!!  Used to spend $6 to $7 on smoothies... Not to mention having to be out and about in order to get one. I literally dump all my ingredients for the smoothie into this blender and hit the button... In 30 seconds I have a delicious smoothie. I use regular old bagged frozen vegetables and fruits... Soften them up in the microwave for 60 to 90 seconds... Dumped in with whatever else I want for that smoothie... ranging from banana, yogurt, milk, chia seeds, oatmeal, cacao powder, a fruit cup, Splenda, unsweetened cacao, chopped walnuts, chopped up ice. Literally less than 30 seconds I have a perfectly blended smoothie. I'm honestly amazed. Recommend this to everybody, point blank!\n"", '\n  Lo compre para hacer batidos de proteína, a estos les Agrego fruta congelada , sin embargo al parecer la potencia no es mucha , ya que se escucha forzado (si ves el vide hace un ruido similar) pero en momentos si le dejas presionado por varios segundos se puede percibir un olor a “quemado” del sobre esfuerzo que hace,\n', '\n  \xa0It’s literally making huge noises, but cannot even shred vegetables or fruit as soft as cucumbers, it could shred oranges tho.

My next blender will be a different brand.\n"", ""\n  No, it's not elegant-looking, and it is indeed loud.  But what do you expect?  Black and Decker is known for its loud, macho power tools, and basically that's what you have here - a loud, macho kitchen power tool.  I appreciate the sturdy glass container and the fact that the basic design is a simple one.  I do recommend following the instruction book's advice to press the pulse button a few times when blending frozen fruit or clunky items into a drink before setting it to a full blend.  Even doing that, though, smoothies can come out a bit lumpy.  For the price, though, it's a bargain and does the job well enough.\n"", ""\n  It's OK. I mean, it's a cheap blender, but it has a glass pitcher. It works fine. It seems to do a better job than its predecessor at mixing frozen drinks with ice. Probably as good as it gets for the money, and if you want something better, more versatile, more powerful, etc. then you'll need to fork over more cash I expect. Quite satisfactory. Copacetic. Bueno.\n"", '\n  These blenders are so cheap. I use it as one would use any blender, and I go through one a year. If  we were able to make a better blender in 1950s that would last longer, or even a lifetime, this company makes a product that is part of the throw-away culture. I guess I am supposed to put down the $200 for the blender that actually does what a blender is supposed to do: blend in normal use without breaking for more than a year.\n', ""\n  Needed a bigger blender so I gave this one a try. I looked at this same one in-store and it was $20 more so I purchased on here. Very simple setup and packaging. The glass part just sits on the base for easy removal once blending is finished. It has 10 speeds low and high for different blends depending on what you're working with. Cleanup is very easy with this blender as the bottom unscrews so you can clean the blades separate. And of course all parts are dishwasher safe which is a plus! Overall a great blender for the price!\n"", ""\n  If it wasn't for the inexpensive price tag ( I paid around 30$ ) I would have given it 3 stars. Reason being 1: the weight of it. The glass part is really heavy to me. I found it tired out my wrists from trying to scrape and get all my smoothie out. Reason number 2 is the sound. Its really loud.. even on the lowest setting. But let's give credit where credit is due. It works really well , it blends really fast. Ive made smoothies and hummus so far and it took me no time to get the ingredients blended. Its a very strong blender. I found it to be worth keeping even with the weight and sound issue\n"", ""\n  Bought this blender and it doesn't even blend properly.Smells like rotten eggs like the engine is burning out.Not even 2 months old and the buttons don't even work properly.Name 'Black and Decker' is already fadingVery disappointed with this inferior product. I had bought this before at Canadian Tire and it was awesome. Bought it again online (b/c i accidently broke the glass container from the previous one) and noticed immediately it was inferior product. I am even questioning if this is even truly a Black and Decker product or if its a knock off overseas version....very upset 0/10. Wasn't going to say anything but today was the last straw with all the smell and non functional buttons.\n"", ""\n  We like this product.

It was awesome and I loved it, using it constantly for smoothies (yes, frozen fruit). I couldn't even complain when it finally died after such a long life. So I immediately bought a second one. It felt different from my old one, it was more 'plastic' and flimsier than my old one. I used it exactly the way I used my old one and for the same type foods, mostly smoothies. It quit after only two months, the gears stripping and sending tiny black pieces of plastic into my food and an oily residue from the motor onto my counter. Unfortunately it was too late to send it back, so I wrote to the seller to no avail, never heard a word. I tossed it out. I thought perhaps I had just gotten a lemon and decided to try again. I bought a third one. This one set a new record ....broke on the second use! Are you kidding me? Again, the gears stripped and it sent up a smelly oily puff of smoke. I can't believe that TWO of these things quit after such a short time after my last one lasted for so many years. This is most definitely NOT the same as they used to be. I am returning it today (thanks Amazon!), and will not buy another ever. Anyone care to recommend a small blender that can do what it promises? sheesh.\n"", ""\n  This is pretty much exactly what I expected when I bought it: a better-than-average representative of the cheaper drink blenders.  I bought this one rather than the cheaper ones because it's possible to get replacement cups and blades for it and I do lose things, not because I expected it to be strong/faster/better than its competition.There's no point in buying this if you want an all-purpose blender.  The whole reason for this is that it has excellent design for blending shakes/drinks.  It's very cleverly designed to be easy to use and - really important - easy to clean.It's not super powerful.  It doesn't even handle my frozen strawberries well right out of the freezer, and I certainly wouldn't give it normal-sized ice cubes.  (After it failed to fully process the frozen strawberries, I didn't even bother trying ice.)  I also haven't tried it with anything without liquid, so I don't know how it would do for grinding or pureeing.  I would probably use other tools for those purposes.  But for shakes, fresh fruit, half-thawed frozen fruit, and similar things, it does a fine job.If I wanted a great blender, I'd pay 2-3 times as much and get something that was 900 watts instead of 300, sharper blades, and a stronger motor.  But I didn't want to spend 2-3 times as much, and I'm satisfied with what I got for the price.  After reading reviews, I feel fairly confident that I chose the right one in its price range.\n"", '\n  The Magic Bullet blender did not live up to our expectations. We bought it to make smoothies from frozen fruit, yogurt, and water/juice. We also tried making a smoothie with fresh fruits, vegetables, water, and ice. Even after breaking up the ice cubes into smaller pieces the magic bullet blender could not pulverize the ice to make it ""drinkable"". When making the frozen fruit smoothies with yogurt, the contents never fully blended together. We had to constantly take the cup off the blender and stir or shake it to distribute the contents adequately. The instructions say to not let the blender run for more than 60 seconds or it may overheat; there is absolutely no way this blender will make a smoothie in less than sixty seconds if you are using either frozen fruit or ice as it just doesn\'t have the power the chop up the frozen ingredients. I would definitely not recommend this product.\n', '\n  Do NOT buy this if you wish to make smoothies... This thing does horrible with ice.... it takes me at least 5-10 minutes to make an 8oz smoothie because the blade is not sharp enough to cut the ice.\n', '\n  Blender has been probably used <10 times in the last 2 months.started making hiss noise and can smell as if something is burning.Such a cheap product. dont buy this\n', '\n  i can only operate the item today and that s*** is burned, almost burn me actually\n', '\n  I had a Nutri Bullet that all of a sudden stopped working so I purchased this as an inexpensive replacement.- if you are expecting a Nutri Bullet, this is not an exact replacement! It is much smaller and clearly not as strong of a motor- if you are looking for an inexpensive blender to make smoothies or shakes, this will be perfect- it can blend a few ice cubes with, say, a banana, some PB, and milk, pretty easily. Any more than that and I could see the motor dying quicklyOther than that, I say it’s worth what you pay and it’s a great small blender for making smoothies\n', ""\n  Initially, i was happy with the purchase- BUT after using this for 8 months, i started seeing the blade wobbling and vibrating  randomly while spinning and making a lot of noise. This is when all the problems started .Update: i year now since i bought and used this, the blade became too lose, couldn't be fixed by tightening the screws. I even opened the blender blades housing, cleaned the junk around the blades and put them back but it would start again after 1 minute of rotation.,Now the blender is lying  in the storeroom and gathering dust and is unusable.  i am going with a different brand now whose quality is much better around the same price point.Overall, the blender's quality is good except the main workhorse where it should have been better BUT is NOT!!\n"", '\n  A mi parecer llegó muy bien todo llegó completo , y el plástico x lo q veía antes de comprarlo q hablan d la mala calidad , la verdad a mi parecer está muy bien , es resistente.
