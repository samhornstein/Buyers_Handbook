I can honestly say it was worth every penny.

The Hydro Flask has allowed me to keep water cold at work and doesn't sweat, allowing me to drink cold and refreshing water all day at the office. It is also great at the gym for the same reasons. And it looks great! The matte finish feels good and the sports cap provides a nice seal. It is pricey, but I haven't bought a diet soda at work in over a month and a half (I was spending at least  $1.75 per day on a 20oz bottle) so it has already paid for itself!

I haven't achieved the 6/8+ hours of ice that some people claim, but I also don't use a lot of ice and often don't close the lid out of laziness.

It's gotten a couple tiny knicks and slight scratches on the lid from general use, but that's to be expected. I love the coating on the outside.
