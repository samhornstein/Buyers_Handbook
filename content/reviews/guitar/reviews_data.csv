I read the reviews prior to purchase and there were some that referenced the ""tuneability"".  These are nylon string guitars they take many times of tuning and re-tuning for the strings to stretch.  This is normal.  A text label on the packaging (wrapped around the neck) cautions the buyer regarding this.I purchased 4 of these guitars at the same time for gifts to aspiring young players from 8 to 15 years old.  I work on/repair guitars often and these were pretty good.  I did have to raise the action / strings on two of them by placing a 3/32 piece of wood under the bridge saddle.  This is common for guitars of this price / quality.  It is great the action was too low rather than too high.  That would have been a much harder fix and probably would have ended in a return and re-order.I wish I had had one of these when I was 10 or 12.  I had to wait until I was 16 for my own first guitar (what a happy day).  The kids will love them.\n', ""\n  After reading a lot of the negative reviews on here, I thought maybe people were being a little too critical for something that is so cheap and obviously meant as a little starter instrument for kids. Of course I wasn't expecting it to be good, but it really is that bad. Might as well throw $30 away. Like everyone else has said, it doesn't hold a tune, no matter how many times you tune it and finally get it right. It will go out of tune almost immediately. Not to mention, on tuning the high E the day I opened it, the string snapped. There's no real excuse for that. I've tuned 1000 different guitars before.So do yourself a favor and do not buy this. ESPECIALLY if you are wanting to get something for your kids to learn on. Spend a little more and get a real instrument for them. Trying to learn on something like this will just discourage anyone from wanting to continue learning to play, because it would just be so frustrating\n"", '\n  I am very familiar with guitars having one for at least 25 years and even changing my own strings.This guitar arrived with rusted strings. I tried tuning it and by the time I got from E to E it was back out of tune. Fine change the strings.  Changed to quality strings. Still WILL NOT hold for tuning.  If you think you want to teach your kids some chords and basic guitar—this is NOT, I repeat NOT the guitar for you. If you’re looking for an out of tune, loud toy, I would still suggest saving your $ and shop at goodwill or Craigslist. The sound can’t get any worse than this.\n', '\n  Guitar plays real nice. I took it on tour and used it as a bus guitar. We play all oldies and this guitar makes me feel like a giant human but in reality im a small man boy that wears womens jeans\n', ""\n  Great little beginner guitar, as long as you change out the strings and tune it up. Mine arrived with three metal strings of the same guage and three nylon strings of the same guage installed. I'm sure the strings it came with would've been fine for playing around with and probably would've eventually held tune after proper break-in and stretching, but I wanted to put the correct size on there so my daughter could watch and learn how to do it. Holds tune well now...but still some improvements needed (fretboard work...better bridge). Overall this is a decent little instrument and perfect for a beginner, and can be made even better with minimal cheap upgrades (strings, bridge, nut, etc.).\n"", ""\n  When the strings stop stretching (you can literally watch them stretch on a tuner) , the one I received plays quite nicely. Pretty easy, easiest acoustic I've tried to play. Still tough for beginners w acoustic till you build up finger tone n dexterity but this may work. Love the blue. Sounds like a nice soft nylon but louder than most acoustics ive heard. Not a musician, disabled back guy. Very light for those who like or need that like me. Quality n value for price, mind blown! Giftable, teachable small light inexpensive nylon acoustic that sounds good. Nice. Im adult so past 15th fret not much use to me w adulthand arm size. Still very glad i bought this. The cord w strap is to tie onto an acoustic, through or around the head stock. 12/10...12/16..update, did i say the strings would stop stretching? Apparently not w nylon.lol Just ordered more strings, sounds very good. Have to tune frequently but getting...a little better. Still plays easy n sounds dreamy. Love the harmonics. Power chords slide pretty easy! =)\n"", '\n  The only reason I’m giving this 3 stars is because it CAN be a good deal for a toddlers beginner. However.. it lacks the fret markers and strap buttons. Neither are much of an issue for me because I already have spare strap buttons laying around, and my daughter is turning 5, I can just use glitter star stickers. I already bought this with the  intention to upgrade the tuning machines, and relic the crap out of it because I’m not a fan of gloss finishes on acoustics.With that being said.... I guess expecting this to have a trust rod was expecting too much, but does the company wanna explain why in the world they painted over the frets!?!? At least the neck is straight but the frets and nut need major adjustments. *I’m using a little acetone on some steal wool to get the paint off the frets.So if you’re not familiar with guitars and set ups enough to MAKE it a dope beginner guitar for your 4 year old? Then this is just a toy.Also, this arrived with old nasty strings, a chip in the headstock, and pretty big scuff the top of the body.Update- because the genius who made this decided that it would be a GReAt IdEa to put lacquer over each layer of paint that COVERS THE ENTIRE GUITAR -Black, red, black, white, pink, then fished with black on the ******* fret board????<(why... just why???????) I am now replacing the frets 🙃I didn’t expect much... but there is seriously no excuse for this\n', ""\n  It's really lovely & my little one is really enjoying it. Really lioks better in person than I expected. Nice touches like embossed metal & pretty inlay. I am very happy with it & so is my sweet little.\n"", ""\n  We purchased this as our 7yo had expressed an interest in learning guitar; knowing how she can be a little clumsy we were hesitant at spending lots for something she would probably fall on and smash!When it arrived, for £20 I was expecting to have to assemble and string, to my amazement this came fully strung (but understandably out of tune) and suitable paper slipped under the strings to protect the fretboard.As you would expect the finish is in part cheap, but tidy and I would say good value for money.This did take a while to tune and for the strings (especially the three thin nylon ones) to fully stretch before they would hold a note.  Seriously; we gave this to our daughter for Christmas and with daily use this took a good 3 weeks before you could play for half an hour with good note retention.  You could re-string with steel to ease this but beware of tiny fingers and the harshness of steel strings on soft fingertips; personally I would persevere with the nylon and the dullness of note until they have got a bit more experience.Size wise, our daughter is 7, but is tall for her age; this is marginally too big for her.  She can reach a 'C' chord, but only just.  This is a grower for her and would probably best suit and 'average' 9yo onwards.  As an adult demonstarating, it is playable, but very tight!!!In summary; it's £20 so don't be expecting Fender or Larrivee sound quality, be prepared to spend time letting the strings stretch out before they hold a note but for what you pay and what it is designed for it does the job.\n"", '\n  Brought this because my 5 year daughter was pestering me to have a go on my guitar (which was a present from a relative, therefore too sentimental to be broken). I didn\'t want to buy a tiny plastic guitar which can\'t be tuned but at the same time wanted something good enough that if my children did want to take up guitar it was there for a potential chord learning.The quality of the guitar seems good to me for the price, obviously not professional standards, I think one of the low strings twangs a bit, doesn\'t bother me. It\'s a nice solid wood, fully varnished, strings have enough tension to be tuned properly and the fret-board/neck is about the right size for a 5 year old\'s fingers in my opinion.I saw a review on here whereby the bridge completely unstuck after it had been ""professionally tuned"". We didn\'t have any problems, had it over two months now. I tuned it myself, and just very gently pulled on the nylon strings upward when tuning it for the first time to give them a little bit of flexibility (don\'t do this on steel string guitars by the way). It naturally de-tuned itself in the first couple of days, this is normal for new strings, after that it\'s been fine. I just re-iterate to my 5 and 3 year olds to just respect the guitar, i.e. not leave it on the floor, put it in the corner when you\'re not using it etc. etc., normal with children, and a nice learning experience on how to treat instruments.I\'ve found myself picking it up and have a few practice runs myself as it\'s in the living room to hand! Cheap price and a reasonable quality considering the price. Design is generic enough to out live a child\'s fast changing trends and tastes, so should do until they leave primary school and then until they want to get serious with guitar playing. Excellent and would recommend.\n', '\n  Our 8 year old son had this a present for Christmas and started lessons  mid January. He’s had 5 lessons for 20 minutes and over night the whole bridge snapped off! The guitar was  professional tuned and well handled/stores so there is not reason for this spontaneously happening  apart form poor quality .  I can’t figure out how to return as it’s after the cut off. But I would like my money back if anyone is reading this!?\n', '\n  La chitarra è arrivata nei tempi, la confezione non presentava difetti, tutto come da descrizione.All\'interno della scatola troviamo la chitarra con corde in nylon, dei plettri duri e grandi (apposta per bimbi inesperti) e una corda di ricambio, e alcune avvertenze poste su punti strategici, in inglese: 1) la chitarra all\'inizio si scorda facilmente - ma tutte le corde in nylon hanno bisogno di qualche giorno per il giusto assestamento; 2) le corde potrebbero rompersi (e basta cambiarle... è una caratteristica comune a tutte le chitarre.).E\' un regalino di Natale anticipato per mio nipote, e prima di dargliela ho pensato di dare una stiracchiata alle corde, passando un paio d\'ore ad accordare, e direi che il compromesso qualità/prezzo mi sembra buono.L\'accordatura ora sta tenendo (al contrario di quanto letto su alcune recensioni inglesi prima dell\'acquisto), in pratica basta partire da un\'accordatura più bassa e portarla fino al La con calma (e girando i piroli lentamente): dopo essere saliti di qualche semitono poi tutte le corde iniziano a stabilizzarsi e si può arrivare all\'altezza giusta, e tra l\'altro la tastiera è anche abbastanza precisa (es. nelle ottave... chiaramente non stando a guardare il capello!).Si, qualche difetto nei dettagli c\'è, si nota qualche sbavatura, e il suono che ne esce fuori non si può proprio definire caldo, pastoso e ricco di armonici... ma stiamo parlando di una chitarrina fatta in serie, e per questo prezzo è tutto più che accettabile (ce ne sono più care, con gli stessi identici difetti), soprattutto se pensiamo che vale la pena spendere 30 euro per ""distrarre"" un bimbo di quell\'età da uno smartphone, o dalla TV).In sintesi: se qualche bambino tra i 6 e i 10 anni (sotto l\'1,40 di altezza, diciamo) di vs. conoscenza manifesta il desiderio di imparare a suonare la chitarra, con poca spesa potete vedere se effettivamente è così, oppure se si tratta di un capriccio passeggero caratteristico a quell\'età: nel primo caso, tra un annetto o più (così c\'è tutto il tempo di fare i calletti nelle dita, capire come si accorda, imparare i primi accordi semplici, un pochino di teoria, le scale, qualche canzoncina, ecc.ecc.) si acquisterà poi uno strumento migliore (e di misura adeguata); nel secondo caso... 30 euro direi che non cambiano la vita.\n', '\n  My 8 yo boy bought this for himself. The size is perfect. Overall great guitar for a child to play or learn basics.And the price is right too, under 20£!\n']"

Gave it a quick tune and played a couple of songs that I remembered from my teenage years. The guitar sounded very good. Can't believe you can get that kind of sound for a hundred bucks. When I was her age you had to get a Fender to get decent sound.\n""]"

None of this is true.  It’s a straight up ukelele and says so on the box.  Second of all, it’s ukelele sized and not a classical guitar at all.  Third, half of the strings are steel and only half are nylon. The nylon strings are stretchy and do not hold a tune whatsoever for longer than 5 minutes.

I'm so glad to have it!\n"", ""\n  First thing is that this arrived almost falling out of the box. As soon as I began to tighten the strings the nut snapped off the end of the fretboard. Amazon rep decided that it was my responsiblity to find a new function box for it and to deliver it to UPS, so I chose to repair it instead.After a lot of filing and removing of poor quality glue, I was able to fix the nut. Only to find that the sound hole is absolutely covered in the same sticky glue all around the edges and also need to be filed down. The guitar was also full of loose wood shards, which took a while to get out. The staining on the neck is shoddy and the tuning pegs wiggle more than they should. One of the pegs is so hard to turn it almost needs a pair of pliers to tune. I'm happy I didn't spend much on this.I will say the sound quality is decent. If you can get through all the repairs it needs right out of the box and the rushed finishing job, it's not bad for a beginner.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone above beginner status.\n"", '\n  This guitar is ok.  I bought it during quarantine to see if I could pick up playing again after several years of not playing. For the price you pay it is good. I would recommend it if you aren’t sure if you’re going to keep up with playing but if you know you are going to use it pay a little more for a higher quality. The D string is almost impossible to tune because it’s quite hard to turn the key - it feels like the string is always on the verge of snapping and it makes a loud clicking noises when you tighten it. Probably defective but not worth returning as it took almost a month to receive it in the first place.The sound quality is better than expected for the price. Size is slightly small but good for me.

Well this guitar is really nice and for me this is great for my son since he is just started practicing.Really good for beginners.  The tune is like those of the professionals.
