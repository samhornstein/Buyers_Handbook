After using it for several day, I'm pretty bummed and will be returning it tomorrow. Here is my list of pros and cons:Pros:* GPS - This is the biggest reason for my excitement; finally a Versa with GPS!  I wanted a way to track my runs without taking my phone with me. (read cons for why I still can't go without my phone) The GPS lost signal during a portion of my run my run..... My phone still had good signal, so not sure why the Versa lost GPS signal. It wasn't for a long period of time (maybe a 0.10 of a mile?), but still disappointing.* SpO2 % - Pretty cool that it can track this....but it only gives a range from when you are sleeping. No way to spot check this. Cannot figure out why they didn't make this possible.* The flat back - the Versa line is the only fitness/smartwatch I have been able to tolerate. I despise the raised round backs of so many others. The back of this watch causes no discomfort.Cons:* No music storage - wth Fitbit?!?! So you added GPS, but took away music storage. Major design flaw. It can only stream music when connected to a phone via Bluetooth, so I *still* must take my phone on runs with me. This is the reason I am returning the watch.  ***EDIT*** - So....you can store music for offline use *ONLY* if you subscribe to Deezer or Pandora. So, It will cost at $10/month to store music. Spotify will only allow to to control the music from the watch, but doesn't allow for offline music. You can't upload your own music to the watch.* SpO2% - like I mentioned above, there is no way to spot check this. I would love to see what happens with my SpO2 during runs, when I go up to higher altitude and workout, etc. But, nope, it only tells me about the values from when I was asleep. *eyeroll*I am going to try the new Garmin Venu Sq Music Edition and hope the back of it is not as uncomfortable as I have experienced with other similar watches. It is about $20 more but can do all the things that the Versa 3 can do PLUS the things the Versa 3 can't. Onboard music storage, and spot checking SpO2. I'll miss the Fitbit communities and my familiarity with the Fitbit platform.\n"", ""\n  I was not thrilled with this Fitbit Versa 3 after using it for a few of days. The screen kept freezing when I'd try to swipe, I couldn't get any music on it because you have to have a paid subscription to Pandora or Deezer, you can't run a timer while using the running app, it won't run my google calendar, and since I am an iPhone user, it doesn't allow me to respond to calls/texts (which I knew beforehand). But I thought, no biggie, Fitbit has a 45 day satisfaction guarantee. I called to initiate the return process and they told me that they would not honor it because I didn't purchase from Fitbit.com. Never mind that this is the Fitbit 'store' on Amazon and never mind that when I originally tried to purchase it through fitbit.com, the order wouldn't process because of a glitch on their end. Bye-bye fitbit, hello Apple watch.\n"", '\n  Cant add local music.  You have to pay $10 a month to store music on device\n', ""\n  Background:I had the Ionic for about 2 years and we all know how that went. When it worked it was great but it had its flaws. My first Ionic lasted about 5 mons. and Fitbit sent me a replacement that lasted another 18mons. That Ionic died at the end of July 2020. So I made a big upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 which with tax set me back almost $500. After a month I absolutely hated it and was sick that I spent so much. I couldn't get more than a day of battery life, it was uncomfortable and honestly I just don't see what extra value it adds over a Fitbit type smart watch. What was worse was after 1 month the watch was marked down about $75 and the resale value was only around $275. So I lost my shirt on that watch....Review:So after dumping the GW3, I opted for the Versa 3 over the Sense as I don't think the extra sensor is worth the premium for my use case. Still has built in GPS which is great and everything I know and love from fitbit. In spite of all the negative reviews for this watch I think it is amazing. The display is bright and smooth, its comfortable, and there may be a tiny lag in the OS but its a FITBIT so honestly, it isn't like it freezes constantly it is just a small infrequent hiccup. Which my $500 GS3 did as well. Most important, I dont need to keep a charger with me at all times as I can get a solid 5 days off of a charge +/- depending on GPS use etc. So for those fitbit lovers who want to upgrade or for those who want a reasonable smart watch or fitness tracker this is for you. Is it a GS3 or Apple watch, No. But IMO, it isn't trying to be something its not. You don't need a bunch of Apps of games on your watch. That is what your $1000 phone is for. A watch is a tool to complement your phone. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy it.\n"", ""\n  So, I am an ex-Pebble watch owner having funded the first Pebble smart watch way back in 2013 and have had various smart watch devices over the years. I have owned the Amazfit Bip and GTS for the last few years and have been really happy.Unfortunately, my Amazfit GTS had a falling out with my tiled bathroom floor recently, which resulted in me needing to find a new watch.  I had ordered a replacement GTS, but noticed that Fitbit were launching the Versa 3 so thought it might be time for a change.For context, I use an Android phone so Apple is out of the question, I'm sure the Apple watch is great and if you are in the Apple eco-system (or walled garden depending on which way you want to look at it!) then I would recommend just going for an Apple watch. I'm sure it will do everything you need and work seamlessly with an Apple phone. For those on a more limited budget and who prefer Android devices then ironically we have more options, but not quite as much quality.So on to my experience with the Versa 3, so far its been pretty good (although do see my Edit at the bottom!).The GOOD+ Comfortable to wear and not too big (Android Wear OS devices Im looking at you!)+ Receives notifications and has been pretty stable so far+ Have set it up to send emails,+ You can see the DNA of a Pebble watch is in here with the UI, payment methods for additional apps and watch faces, which is a good thing as Pebble got a lot of things right.+ Ive found the step count to be fairly accurate so far, requires a bit more a longer term test but seems fine to me, I'm not the sort of person who religiously checks every step so its ok.+ I like the weather details that you can get+ I like the fact I can load my payment card on to the watch fairly easily and use to pay for things+ I like the notifications for apps from my phone.+ Sleep tracking seems pretty accurate, it doesn't show up immediately in the morning as its trying to figure out if you are awake, but does pop up on the Today screen after a short while.+ Alexa works reasonably well and I could imagine if I put in the time I could get it to do all sorts of things.+Lots of potential if the software could catch up with the hardwareThe SO, SO+ The watch band sizing is a bit odd, this is a bit unique for each user but Im actually in between a small and a large size, so have opted for large but do find the remaining strap a bit too long as its tucked into and under the watch band. Tolerable.+ The capacitive button. Not too bad a bit weird at first as really why not a physical button? Its on the left hand side of the watch. Honestly not too bad once you figure it out and really no different from a physical button after a couple of days!- The app store is a bit light on apps! It looks like Fitbit released a new SDK and not a lot off apps have updated yet  so not a lot of choice. Miss the Pebble store as it had some great apps.- The screen is a bit smaller than I expected, I only have the GTS as I reasonable point of reference and that device had a superb screen, bigger and still a normal watch size. Tolerable and not a deal breaker.+ The Fitbit eco-system seems interesting and I quite like the fitness reminders and functionality - but yet to fully get into this yet having just moved over.- I did have to fiddle around with Do Not Disturb and Silent settings on my phone a bit to get notifications set up. I used to just have the phone on silent, but doing this means you get no notifications on Fitbit. So I've had to reset everything to work with Do Not Disturb. Which is fine but a bit of a faff.- Vibration is a bit weak for notifications and no way of changing the intensity. Interestingly the alarm notification is reasonably strong and has a pattern. But the normal message one needs to be stronger in my opinion as I do find I ignore it more than previous watches.- Responding to text messages, I cant use voice which the later Pebble watches could and were half a decade older in tech(!), so maybe something that will get implemented in the future- Kiezel Pay - still going and a Pebble thing. Bit weird the Fitbit app store uses this. Im sure they could implement something slicker but see point below around the Fitbit UI.The NOT SO GOOD- Music. Oh dear, naughty to say that the device can store music when in reality its a very poor option. The Versa 2 as I understand it has a specific offline Music app which you can transfer your own MP3s to the watch. Its not really particularly clear that on the Versa 3 only Deezer and Pandora allow music to actually be stored on the device. Two services I haven't really used in the UK, pretty sure Pandora isn't really available in Europe. The Spotify functionality only controls Spotify and there is no offline storage for this app which is a bit disappointing. There is no way to actually transfer MP3s to the watch as this app looks to have been removed. So if you do want music on the device in the UK, looks like you are out of luck.- The speaker. Well there is one as the watch made a noise when I first booted it up. But unfortunately it doesn't actually do anything. I haven't tried a voice call yet. I suspect this will is a 'coming soon' feature and I'm sure Alexa and Google will start talking to me one day, but until later this year the speaker serves no real purpose at present for me.- No Google Play Assistant - well yet anyway! This is coming later in the year too....- The Fitbit eco-system / UI seems a bit clunky, in fact its a bit of a mess to be honest. Feels a bit like multiple team developing there own tools and features and then somehow it just about hangs together rather than a slick and polished experience. There are all kinds of options and I'm sort of a bit confused what I'm really supposed to be looking at sometimes. The best example is switching the watch faces from 12hr to 24hr clock. You need to log into a web dashboard to find an obscure option to set. Which is a bit daft when I have an app and the watch which would be much better places for this setting! Maybe its just a learning curve Im on....- The watch bands are expensive. They are also specific to the Versa 3 and Sense and use a clip mechanism, so you cant just use a standard watch band or quick release bands of any kind (of which I now have a load of 20mm bands sitting in a draw from my Amazfit devices)- The screen on when you move the wrist, possibly the most disappointing aspect. The Amazfit GTS was spot on in this regard and would flick on instantly. Not so here, you need a fairly good forced motion to get the screen to come on to view the time and a few times Ive just given up and tapped the capacitive button on the side to wake the screen up. You do have the option of an always on display, but if you want your watch to drain after a day and a bit go for it, I quite like the comfort of a reasonably charged battery. I think I can just about deal with it but I'm sure this should be much better.- The charger cable! What were they thinking here. Its about 25cm long. Im unclear what the expectation is here but I tend to keep the devices near my phone which has a cable that stretches to the wall. Not sure why they don't give a reasonable length cable. I'm lucky(!) as Amazfit also do the same thing, so I already have a simple USB extension cable to solve this problem. But honestly!TOP TIPS- The capacitive button!  Its fine really, I'm surprised at the one star mentions...Basically put your index finger on the right of the watch and then press with your thumb just under the watch back on the left a little to 'press' it with a good proportion of the thumb. Honestly, when I first opened box and started to use the watch I thought it was going to be massively irritating, but its fine once you figure it out. Not a problem at all.- Notifications on the watch show the notifications on your phone and if you clear on the watch they can be cleared on the phone and vice versa.- My Agenda app wasn't syncing. Agenda shows dairy appointments. I uninstalled the app via the Fitbit app store and then re-installed it. It then woke up and I could see my calendars and I could select which one I wanted to show on the app.- Logging water intake is hidden away in the advanced settings when you swipe up, this can be adjusted on the watch. If you turn water logging on you can then log water when yous wipe up and scroll down and press the log button under the water area.- Disable battery optimisation on your phone! Constant disconnects are largely to do with how your phone deals with background apps. If you let the Fitbit app run in the background and then lock the app on the recent apps screen using the padlock you have a better chance of not having disconnections. This is pretty much the case for most smartwatch companion apps on a phone.Ill come back and update depending on how i get on and when features are released.EDIT: So....Ive returned the device!!!, why? Well Garmin have launched the the Venu Sq and to be honest although I like the software in the Versa 3 the actual capability of the Garmin offers pretty much the same (although a bit less polished) functionality and allows me to use my small collection of watch straps. The Fitbit could be great, but the watch strap just didnt fit well and was starting to get annoying, the fitness functionality is limited (in comparison to the Garmin). The music services felt like a bit of a cheat on the Versa 3 and the speaker functionality doesnt really do what it should. Maybe in a few months time this will all get sorted but the Garmin feels more robust and just seems to work out of the box (no fitness subscription, complicted setup or half baked services). Will be interested to see what Google will do with Fitbit, but for the time being Ill stick with the new Garmin Venu Sq.\n"", '\n  \xa0Llevo probando este smartwatch desde el mes de septiembre, en su lanzamiento.Ya por entonces realicé un análisis, pero quiero matizar algunas cosas que han cambiado y otras que no. De entrada haré un repaso de sus características y especificaciones más destacables.PROS:✅ DISEÑO Y PANTALLA. Aunque han seguido la estética del Versa 2( algo que veo acertado, pues es discreto, cómodo y elegante), han mejorado el tamaño de la pantalla, aumentando hasta 1,58"" pulgadas. Lo han conseguido haciendo unos marcos más finos y dándole una pequeña curvatura a su pantalla . Una pantalla que, por cierto, es Amoled, con una resolución más que decente de 336 x 336 píxeles y va equipada con protección Gorilla Glass 3.Es un reloj de tamaño medio, rematado con un bisel de aluminio, que queda y se adapta bien a tu muñeca. Viene con dos tamaños de correas fáciles de intercambiar y es muy cómodo de llevar.✅ GPS INCORPORADO. Es, quizás, la tecnología más destacable y esperada por todos los usuarios de Fitbit Versa.Ya no es necesario llevarse el móvil para salir a caminar o correr. Gracias a que el VERSA 3 también incorpora el sistema GLONASS de posicionamiento, los sensores recogerán todos los datos del recorrido, distancia, ritmo y mapa.✅ SENSOR ÓPTICO MEJORADO. El nuevo sensor Pure Pulse 2.0, aumenta el número de puntos de lectura sobre la muñeca, aumentando así su precisión. Todos los datos de variación de pulso quedarán reflejados en una gráfica para consultar en la app. Consiguiendo también una mejor monitorización del sueño.✅ CARGA RÁPIDA Y BATERÍA. Incluye un cable imantado que se acopla perfectamente a los ping de carga de la parte trasera del reloj y proporciona una carga rápida que en sólo 12 minutos, conseguirás 24 horas de autonomía y en 40 minutos el 80% de su carga. El fabricante promete una autonomía de 6 días, evidentemente sin activar ninguna función, como el GPS, notificaciones , pantalla Always On y demás funciones. Todas estas funciones harás disminuir drásticamente su autonomía.✅ ALEXA, SPOTIFY Y DREEZER. Cuenta con el asistente de Amazon( ahora, después de tres meses funciona). Los demás son previa suscripción claro. Pero ahí están para el que las crea necesarias.✅ OTRAS CARACTERÍSTICAS.- Pago por NFC, sólo en algunos bancos que vienen especificados en la web de Fitbit.- Más de 20 modos deportivos. Función SmarTrack, que reconocerá el tipo de entrenamiento e iniciará la sesión por su cuenta.- Resistente al agua, 50 metros de profundidad.CONTRAS:❌ Hay dos especificaciones y mejoras que llevan anunciando de manera oficial en su web desde su lanzamiento.Pero luego ponían que serían operativas en una actualización a finales del 2020:1.- MICRÓFONO Y ALTAVOZ. Características con las que podías recibir y contestar llamadas directamente desde el reloj. Recientemente han entrado en funcionamiento en la última actualización, demasiado tarde para mí gusto. Además creo que es duplicar funciones, ya que debes tener cerca el móvil para hablar, algo a lo que no le veo el sentido.2.- GOOGLE ASSISTANT. Otra promesa que hicieron desde el principio y que también entraría en una actualización a finales de año. Lamentablemente esta promesa NO SE HA CUMPLIDO. En la app pone que no está disponible en mi región. Soy de Barcelona, o sea que tampoco estará toda España. UNA DECEPCIÓN TOTAL!!!📢 En mi opinión, no se pueden crear unas expectativas en las especificaciones y luego decir que entrarán en una actualización a finales de año, ¡¡¡ DESPUÉS DE TRES MESES DE SU LANZAMIENTO!!! 🤬❌ APP GRATUITA A MEDIAS. La app está bien, aunque me costó bastante enlazar mi móvil con el Versa 3 y os aseguro que estoy muy acostumbrado a manejar equipos electrónicos. Lo malo de la app es que si quieres visualizar las gráficas y monitoreo completos de toda tu actividad diaria, TIENES QUE PAGAR UNA SUSCRIPCIÓN QUE NO ES NADA BARATA. EN SERIO? O sea que yo pago un precio por todos los componentes, características y especificaciones que tiene el Fitbit Versa 3, pero si luego quiero sacarle el máximo partido y conocer todos los datos recogidos de mi actividad, TENGO QUE PAGAR OTRA VEZ!!! Lo veo ilógico y ABUSIVO.CONCLUSIÓN:- El nuevo VERSA 3 no es un mal reloj, pero creo que se han quedado en tierra de nadie.Me explico:- No se puede competir con un reloj deportivo como los Polar o Garmin, y tampoco pueden competir con un smartwatch pensado para monitorizar la salud (aunque se han esforzado en este punto), donde los Apple están muy por encima.Pienso que hay mejores opciones que han lanzado sus competidores y rivales, en estos tres meses de espectativas incumplidas, a un precio muy competitivo y con mejores especificaciones y sin pagar de más para ver todos los datos recogidos en la app.Yo NO ME LO COMPRARÍA, porque pienso que no han cumplido lo que prometían.Por lo tanto NO LO RECOMIENDO.Espero que os sea útil mi opinión y experiencia con este producto 👍\n', ""\n  The new Versa 3 promises a lot, but ultimately it suffers from the inherent unreliability of all Fitbits. I have had several and all have failed in one way or another over the years, but one comment failure that I have had at some point with all Fitbits is difficulty to charge the device. Usually this occurs after several months, but with the New Versa 3, Fitbit have really excelled and produced a device which won't charge straight out of the box even though the charger is magnetised and snaps into place. After several resets and plugging into several different sockets, I still have no joy. It maybe that this is an isolated case and I just got unlucky. Time will tell I guess. In any case I will have to return the device to Amazon so its not a great start .Update... got replacement from Amazon and guess what it wouldn’t charge either. Before you ask I am capable of charging a multitude of devices so this is not down to me!\n"", '\n  Auf Grund einiger Vorstellungsbeiträge zu diesem Gerät hab ich mich entschieden die Fitbit Versa 3 vorzubestellen.Mein Hauptgrund, mich für die Versa 3 zu entscheiden, war, dass angeblich ein Lautsprecher verbaut wird und man sie damit auch als ""Freisprecheinrichtung"" nutzen kann. Ich wollte nicht jedes Mal in meiner Tasche nach meinem Handy suchen müssen oder wenn man die Hände voll hat alles weglegen, sondern so einfach schnell Anrufe beantworten.Wie sich herausgestellt hat gibt es diese Funktion aber überhaupt nicht! Es wird in der Gebrauchsanweisung (Download direkt von Fitbit) & laut Infos aus der Fitbit Help-Community darauf hingewiesen, dass nicht damit telefoniert werden kann. Man kann Anrufe lediglich annehmen & ablehnen (bei Annahme muss man dann erst wieder das Telefon zu Hand nehmen).Ein anderer Rezensent schreibt auch, dass Telefonate möglich sind... das fragt man sich ob er dieses Gerät überhaupt getestet hat oder ob er lediglich die Infos aus solchen Produktvorstellungen kopiert und eingefügt hat.Wenn jemand weiß wie es geht, dann freue ich mich natürlich über Info dazu.Da für mich der Hauptgrund das Telefonieren mit der Uhr war und für mich das GPS nicht wirklich wichtig ist, da mein Handy normal sowieso dabei ist, hätte ich mir die knapp 80 Euro mehr sparen können und dafür die Versa 2 kaufen können... die hätte es wenigstens auch in ansprechenderen Farben gegeben.Ich hoffe jetzt weiterhin auf ein Update, dass das Telefonieren ermöglicht - da ja die Hardware angeblich vorhanden ist, sollte sich das problemlos via Update einrichten lassen.Sonst wirkt das Gerät schön, abgesehen davon, dass ich nach einem Tag daheim auf der Couch beim Häkeln schon eine kleine Mini-Schramme im Alugehäuse unter dem Display habe (ohne irgendwo angestoßen zu sein)... Ob das bei einer Fitness-Uhr normal ist sei dahingestellt. Ich hätte auf jeden Fall erwartet, dass sie unempfindlicher ist.Auffällig war, dass es auch bei der Schreibtischarbeit (tippen am PC) einige Schritte gezählt hat. Das konnte ich lösen indem ich die Handgelenkseinstellung auf ""dominant"" umgestellt habe (Dominant = wenn man die Uhr auf der Seite trägt mit der man schreibt oder isst, daher reagiert sie nicht auf alle Bewegungen so sensibel).Die Versa 3 reagiert aber hervorragend und lässt sich flüssig bedienen.Sie kam mit etwas über 60% Akkuladung. Erste Bedienung am Freitagabend. Trotz viel herumspielen und einstellen hatte ich am Sonntagabend noch knapp 20% Akkuladung. Wenn das so bleibt dann bin ich auf jeden Fall mit der Akkuleistung sehr zufrieden. Habe sie dennoch Sonntagabend geladen und sie war binnen 2 Stunden komplett geladen.Clock-Faces sind noch nicht allzu viele verfügbar, das wird sich wahrscheinlich auch noch ändern da sie ja ganz neu auf dem Markt ist.Ob sie wirklich so wasserdicht ist wie beschrieben kann ich derzeit noch nicht beantworten, habe sie lediglich kurz komplett unter fließendes Wasser gehalten, was sie problemlos überstanden hat.Soviel zum Fazit nach 2,5 Tagen durchgehender Nutzung - mal schauen wie es in einem halben Jahr aussieht.\n', ""\n  I LOVE this fitbit! Trying to get fitter and needed some motivation to get going so I thought I would treat myself to a new fitbit.  And I am so glad I did! Firstly,  the fitbit came with 60% battery charge so I could use it straight out of the box. It comes with both a small and a large strap. Unlike my previous fitbit,  changing straps is super easy.Very easy to connect to the app. Unfortunately one down side is needing to subscribe to the music providers to be able to add music,  would be great if amazon music was included.What I love is the simple activity tracker with the built in GPS. Im no marathon runner but being able to just head out the door without needing to carry my phone and just track with the watch is brilliant! The watch is very easy to navigate,  GPS kicks in quickly and off you go. Once home it sends it over to the app so you can see a nice map of where you have been. Love the additional features that remind me to get up and move. Lots more features to explore further. All in all I'm very happy with it.6 Week UpdateSo since owning this fitbit I'm still very happy and super impressed!The battery life is fantastic! Lasts for days, only needs a short charge to give it a decent amount of battery.The best features is the 'get active' feature. I bought this fitbit to increase my activity level. Working at home and just being a bit lazy has seen my activity levels plummet,  sometimes not even reaching 1000 steps per day (!) And I could feel my fitness levels have dropped. Once the fitbit knew my average daily step count, the get active feature has set me a challenge to increase my steps over 2 weeks, first to 4000 steps per day and now after achieving that I'm achieving 6600 steps per day as my next target.  It has helped me learn how to add activity to my day, I'm not going out and having massive walks, I'm getting up and moving more around the house, getting up and walking for breaks during the day, doing running on the spot for 5 minutes etc. anything to up my step count and surprisingly I have realised I can achieve quite alot of steps in a relatively short period of time. Next I'm hoping to increase to 8000 steps per day which I already feel is achievable,  and after that to hit the golden 10,000 per day. All on track to achieve this within 8 weeks or starting! It really has changed my life. I can also feel a real improvement in my fitness levels and I now have way more energy during the day and am sleeping much better at night.\n""]"

It is an exceptionally poor product with a garbage heart rate sensor. How fitbit allowed such an inferior product to be sold I have no idea. The side button regularly activates unintentionally when pressed against the wrist but fails to press when you try to. The screen regularly fails to register swipes. But by far the most egregious design failure is the heart rate sensor. The whole workout it registered way off as demonstrated in the image.Professional reviews all made the same points but i assumed they were overstated or were software fixes that would be worked out. I was wrong. I will be returning the watch and getting a Garmin.\n', '\n  Pretty much a letdown overall. My main disappointment is that it doesn\'t come with the ECG or the Google Assistant available! These were the two main functions I bought it for, and was advertised that it had. It can be hard to find my phone and sync at times. The sp02 feature only works with one specific clock face so it must be in use before you go to bed at night for it to work (bummer).The new charger is really good and easily used, and changing bands only takes only seconds. Fit and finish are impeccable.I was told be Fitbit\'s tech support that there was a 45 day return window from the ""date of purchase"", which was the date that you pre-ordered. I didn\'t actually get the watch for about a month from that date though! That means I\'ve only got about a 15 day period in which to evaluate it then! Plus, Fitbit charges your card or account the day you place the pre-order, that sucks. Most companies charge you only when an item ships, the decent thing to do. I\'ve found Fitbit\'s tech support agents are very hard to communicate with because English is apparently not their first language. I\'m still debating sending my unit back depending upon how long it takes to get these advertised, but not provided, functions up and running as well as numerous little bug fixes, but I\'ll have to hurry! By the way, I purchased mine from Fitbit, not Amazon.\n', '\n  GPS doesn\'t work. It states ""GPS connecting..."" then, after a minute, ""No GPS Signal"". I\'ve used GPS to track my daily bike rides on my Versa 2. I was hoping, by getting the Sense, I wouldn\'t have to lug my phone around with me anymore.I\'ve contacted Fitbit Support. The first representative wasn\'t able to assist. They escalated the issue to a ""special team"". Now I\'m waiting on the next tier of support to reach out to me.I\'m leaving a 1-star review for now, seeing that the major reason I bought this device -- built-in GPS -- doesn\'t function at all. I\'ve been a Fitbit customer for years (having the Versa 1, Versa 2, and smart scales) so I hate to say that I\'m disappointed in this product. But I am extremely disappointed.\n', ""\n  So far the watch itself seems OK, but Fitbit burned me as a customer in the set up process. Not once, but twice during set up the user is presented with upsell screens (insurance and premium service) for which there is only an OK button to move on.  You have to back out of the screen and dismiss a warning to avoid buying the upgrade and then,  the watch did not leave set up mode until after updating (warning may take more than 20 minutes, and yes, 90 is more than 20. Ninety minutes during which you have to leave the phone on the Fitbit app's update screen and so cannot use your phone)\n"", '\n  I was so excited to receive my Fitbit sense since I suffer from SVT and like to keep close watch on my heart rate...what a huge disappointment.

I barely can get heart rate, watch is unresponsive.Unless I can figure it out quickly, I might be returning it. Previous fitbit was amazing experience, I don't know what they did to make this\n"", '\n  I\'ve been in the Fitbit ecosystem for a while, having owned a Charge, Blaze, Aria and 3 Ionics (They kept breaking) This is a super long review to help potential buyers as much as possible as this is a costly device. If I\'ve missed anything you want to know, please leave me a question and I\'ll try to answer. Skip to the bottom for the TLDR summary.Updated review 17/01/21====================Just a quick update to my review with the new features. ECG has now been added (in the UK anyway), it\'s a simple 30s affair. Just place your thumb and forefinger on opposite sides of the bezel and 30s later you either get told your heart beat is fine or ""inconclusive"". Is it accurate? Who knows, but there are a lot of hoops Fitbit have to jump through to get approval for such a feature, so let\'s assume it is. If you get multiple ""inconclusives"" it\'s worth a checkup. No complaints, good feature.Google Home has now been added to the voice assistants along with Alexa. Personally I still find them both useless as they don\'t work when you\'re not within Bluetooth range of your phone, and range does seem awful. If I walk to my kitchen (20-25ft) and leave my phone in the office it will lose connection, and only randomly reconnect when it feels like it (I assume when it next tries to sync). Even if you walk back within range and then try to use the feature IT STILL DOESN\'T WORK. It tells me to use my phone and do a sync. Well, if I\'m picking up my phone I may as well just use Alexa/Google on that? Again, this is just a battery saving exercise that cripples functionality.The speaker works! Well, Google/Alexa will respond with voice anyway. But I can\'t help but feel saying ""Set a timer for 5 minutes"" and getting a voice response saying ""OK"" should also mean when the timer expires I get some kind of sound. But no, the watch just still vibrates instead. Come on? I know Fitbit are a small company but a device with a speaker that doesn\'t give an option to make a SOUND when a timer expires? Come on.My original 3 star review stands at this point. The Sense is merely an Ionic (£140) with a bezel that can do ECG and EDA tests. Let\'s hope the Google acquisition which has now completed gives Fitbit the budget they need to push onwards. Is the Sense worth it? No. Can better firmware/software save it? Possibly. But I can\'t help but feel the next generation with Google funding will be the one worth waiting for.If you want a tracker right now? Well I\'d *love* to try the top offerings from Garmin or Huawei as they are definitely catching Fitbit but my budget doesn\'t allow for that. My opinion? Wait for a price drop, £300 is too much.Original review============Coming in at £300 RRP again, this is Fitbit\'s flagship model. Taking a look at the basics:* Aesthetics - 5/5Very impressed! Available in black/grey and a more effeminate ""pale rose gold"", the colour options are pretty limited. No steel grey, or shiny silver - for now anyway. Whatever colour you choose, you\'re stuck with as the entire watch is the same colour, so choose wisely. The watch itself has a ""squircle"" shape (a square-ish circle, or a circle-ish square :P) that actually looks much better than I expected. Quality wise, it all looks great. The Ionic looked a bit awkward and cheap, especially around the lip of the screen but the Sense looks well crafted and uses the good stuff like aerospace-grade aluminium and Gorilla glass. The screen also has big, smooth rounded edges making swipes super-comfy. A massive improvement, it looks simple yet elegant, good job Fitbit, best looking watch you\'ve ever made (Check my photos)The strap is the newer design that doesn\'t have a buckle and folds in and under itself for a lower profile. The whole watch and strap feel nice and light, secure and comfortable. No complaints.* Screen - 3/5Initially, I was very happy with the screen. At 1.58"" it helps my aging eyes a little. Bright and clear and now AMOLED so it outputs super-black blacks that really help make the screen blend into the surrounding bezel - you can\'t see where the screen ends and the bezel begins unless you\'re in very bright light. Also note that AMOLED gives the option of an always-on mode. I\'m especially happy about this, if only to get rid of the awkward but painstakingly long moments when someone asks ""what\'s the time"" and you do the ol\' ""Fitbit-wrist-flick and stare"" - waiting for the watch to turn on, often in vain. Being AMOLED any part of the screen that is black is using negligible battery power, so there\'s the potential for some really long battery life. It\'s worth noting the actual screen itself (or the part you can see anyway) is also a squircle. This means clock faces with a solid background look a bit odd and show the thick bezel and also means there\'s no corners to put stats in. With AMOLED I\'m not sure why they didn\'t just use a square screen and leave the corners black.So why 6/10? Well my first Sense had a strong red tint to all colours as they got darker. This meant all gradients appeared to fade out to red. My replacement (thank you Amazon) was much better, but now has a slight red tint all over the screen, along with more black crush and some greeny yellows. I\'m either desperately unlucky or the Fitbit Quality Control isn\'t that hot. I would feel bad abusing Amazon\'s goodwill any more, so I\'m keeping this one. You may not be as picky as me however but bear it in mind. I was, and still am, disappointed.* Default watch face designs and UI - 3/5For unknown reasons, Fitbit\'s watch face designs are almost always awful and there\'s no change here. Awkward layout and often with no settings to let you choose what stats you want to see (sigh) You can thankfully download a new one from 1000s created by 3rd parties (Fitbit really should pay some of these developers and use their designs) Note Fitbit still don\'t have a proper store payment method (Don\'t they want a cut from purchases?) so it means you have to go to 3rd party pages and pay a couple of dollars to random sites, which all feels a bit nasty. It\'s also worth noting if you download a watch face without an always-on display, you get stuck with Fitbit\'s defaults which are UGLY (See photos) And to make matters worse, only ""certified"" developers are allowed to make a watch face with an always-on display so the choice is a bit limited for that.The UI itself is an improvement, but it\'s still very basic with minimal animation and a lot of flat-shaded graphics. There\'s a fine line between minimalism and just looking too simple/basic, and it leans towards the simple side a bit too much. It\'s also a bit laggy at times. Sometimes animations just skip straight to the end, sometimes taps and swipes go awry. The compromises to save battery are starting to feel a little too much and the basic UI does take away from the premium look of the Sense somewhat.* Features - 5/5Firstly, let\'s not underestimate the importance of this one - A SPEAKER. Yes you heard correctly, it finally makes a noise! Well, it does when you initially turn it on, other than that I haven\'t heard a peep out of it. I\'m assuming eventually there\'ll be an option to have audible alarms and to make the UI and the buttons beep when you press them etc. but for now, it\'s just *another* feature to wait for. It\'s the 21st century guys, c\'mon.Microphone. Currently at launch we have Alexa integration. Well, there\'s a certain irony in using a fitness device to do things like turn the lights on and off so you don\'t have to get up, but the option is nice to have. It doesn\'t speak back to you, you just get text on the screen however. There is mention of taking and answering calls using the speaker and microphone, but it\'s not here yet so don\'t assume it will ever arrive.""The button"". You\'ve probably heard about this if you\'ve read any other Sense review. There\'s no physical buttons any more, just a weird single indentation on the left of the Sense, just below the strip used for EDA and ECG scans. However, in use it\'s not as bad as it sounds. You have to actually squeeze the Fitbit harder than expected to activate it, but otherwise it\'s fine, with a satisfying vibration. If you have hairy arms like me though, you\'ll keep tugging on them as you press with your whole thumb which isn\'t that comfortable :)Heartrate Sensor. It has the PurePulse2.0 sensor which is allegedly more accurate but I can\'t say I\'ve noticed it responding any quicker or being any more accurate than the Ionic. If it is an improvement, it\'s not much and a look around at some in-depth tests show it\'s lagging behind the competition a bit. For resting heartrate and steady state cardio it\'s fine, if you do lots of HIIT you may see more issues with accuracy.Blood Oxygen Sensor. As with the Ionic, right now this only works when you sleep - there\'s no spot testing. Also worth noting in the app you only get a graph showing the variance, not the actual percentage. If you can be bothered to select a certain watch face at night, and wear it for about an hour after waking, you get an actual percentage range but this is far from ideal. Let\'s hope Fitbit fix this to work with any watch face.Electrodermal activity (EDA) Sensor. Put your hand over the screen and it measures your stress level over a 2 minute (or longer) period, looking essentially at how much you sweat. How accurate it is, I\'m not sure, but the results definitely seem to be lower when I feel more relaxed. This goes towards a ""stress management score"", along with activity levels and sleep quality. Fitbit are a fan of these arbitrary numbers, but getting them higher (or lower) is almost like a game. This is a good thing as I find myself purposely taking 2 minutes out of my day to take the test which is good for mindfulness and relaxation. Also, I want to beat yesterday\'s score. In your face yesterday\'s me!Built in GPS. Took a couple minutes to connect the first time, under 20s the second time. Solid and accurate enough for me looking at the routes plotted on Google maps that it shows in the app on my phone.Electrocardiogram (ECG). Measure your heart\'s rhythm for irregularities that can lead to stroke, etc. It\'s been approved by the relevant bodies in the US, UK and various other countries but the app to do it isn\'t here yet. It should be soon (October), but until it is, it\'s another omission and a sign the Sense has been rushed to market.Notifications from your phone can be shown on your watch, but the usual restrictions apply. e.g. your phone has to be nearby, and you can only reply if you use Android. It\'s too clunky to really bother with imo.It also has the usual Fitbit specs (altimeter / gyroscope / etc) and now also tracks additional stats that are shown in the Fitbit app on your phone (discussed later)* Watch Apps - 2/5There\'s still a very limited selection of apps, and they\'re all constrained by the same simple graphics and low performance as the OS itself. I rarely find myself using any of them, bar the main ones for tracking exercise and the ones required to do EDA and ECG scans.Spotify - still only lets you control the music, not download it to your Sense for offline playback. Note the Sense has no data connection unless it is connected to your phone. This saves battery, but it necessitates the ability to download music! What\'s the point of onboard GPS if you need to take your phone too for music anyway?Deezer - who even uses this? I assume Fitbit have a deal with them but I have enough subscriptions thanks. Support what people use please Fitbit, not what you want them to use.There\'s also basic apps for settings timers and alarms but they\'re all a bit clunky. There\'s also apps to help you with breathing and mindfulness but unless you\'re trapped somewhere you don\'t have your phone, they\'re hardly worth the effort.* The main Fitbit App on your phone - 4/5It doesn\'t change much but is solid enough. I can happily say I\'ve had NO problem with syncing the Sense with the app. Literally every Fitbit I\'ve ever owned has had trouble with this. For the Sense there\'s a new section called ""Health Metrics"" which includes:Breathing rate - how many times you breathe in and out per minute as you sleepHeart rate variability - this is a new one for me. It calculates the difference in time between your heartbeats - worth reading aboutSkin temperature - you don\'t get a core reading (it\'s on your wrist remember) but you get to see the variance which may warn you of a possible rise in core temp tooOxygen saturation - if you use the special watch face at night...Resting heart rate - Same data as beforeStatistics are great, there\'s nothing quite like exercising, working hard to get fitter and seeing tangible changes in your numbers. Fitbit know this and are throwing more numbers than ever at you. Don\'t worry too much about absolute values as this is just a watch on your wrist remember, it\'s hard for it to be too accurate with such a limited amount of data coming in, but working on making those values move in the right direction is the core addiction. I can honestly say seeing statistics improve in the Fitbit app (and seeing how they tank when I\'m lazy and/or drink alcohol :P) is great motivation to do better each day.* Half a star off for:Fitbit Pay. One of the disappointments on the Ionic continues to disappoint, at least for us in the UK. Santander is still the only major bank represented, along with a ""who dis?"" list of others. I\'m worried by the continued lack of Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC, etc. Is it a security issue? Or Fitbit laziness? Either way, the UK is still considered not cool enough to pay for stuff with a tap of the watch. Boo.Fitbit Premium. Thanks for paying £300 for your new smartwatch, enjoy it! Oh and btw, if you want to access ALL the stats you have to pay a whopping and frankly wholly unrealistic £8.99/mo to see them. You get 6 months for free with the Sense and for now it\'s mainly the more advanced sleep statistics that are behind this paywall (and some coaching videos, but not many), but who knows what else may end up there - it really isn\'t clear in the app. This double dipping is not cool, the processing/storage required for these statistics is minimal. I really hope they remove this charge or at least massively reduce it. If you want £8.99/mo (same as Netflix) you need to provide something NEW for it every month Fitbit.* SummaryAt first I thought the Sense had been rushed out of the door somewhat to capitalise on the pandemic and peoples\' interest in their health, but I think it was more to compete with the 3 new Apple watches. Let\'s get this clear, the Fitbit is for you if you want a 24hr health and wellness wearable. The battery lasts for 5 days, and you *should* wear it at all times to accurately and properly track your health as much as possible. Ill health doesn\'t wait for your battery to be charged :) The Apple watch has a 16hr battery life. It looks better, runs much faster, does sp02 spot checks and uses a proper slick OS. If you just want an exercise tracker and spot checking, it\'s a better choice. If you\'re more interested in your general wellbeing and fitness trends throughout the entire day and just want to ""wear and forget"" something, the Fitbit is the one. I feel like Fitbit need to stop trying to compete with Apple, they\'re a different market imo, and just focus on themselves. That said, I do wish Fitbit would worry a little less about battery length and more on performance. The UI struggles at times to keep up, scrolling is still a bit lumpy and I am concerned that things will only get worse as more features get enabled and more compromises are made. Google are in the process of acquiring Fitbit so we can expect some positive changes in the future, but for now the Sense has done ""just enough"".* Should you buy it?If you\'re looking for an upgrade from a Versa or Ionic, I\'d personally wait for the ECG app to work and a more sensible use of the sp02 sensor. When they\'re here, it\'s a solid choice. If you have an older Fitbit, this is a nice piece of kit and a worthy upgrade. Consider the Versa 3 though if you aren\'t bothered about EDA or ECG.TLDR:The Sense is good, but not quite good enough right now - with the potential to be great.A slightly-generous 3 stars.This review will be updated as more features become available.

I get nothing from this other than knowing writing all this waffle helped someone out :)\n', '\n  Da ich auf der Suche nach einer guten Fitnessuhr/Smartwatch bisher nicht fündig geworden bin, hoffe ich das die neue Fitbit Sense mich überzeugen kann!Vorweg: Ich habe bereits die neuste Galaxy Watch sowie eine Fitbit Ionic und auch die neue Oppo Watch getestet. So das ich damit recht gut vergleichen konnte.► Optik und erster EindruckZuerst einmal muss ich sagen, das ich schon etwas von Fitbit enttäuscht bin!Die Ionic Reihe wurde aktuell bisher nicht weitergeführt und stattdessen kommt nun die Fitbit Sense in dem selben Design wie die neue Fitbit Versa 3.Versteht mich nicht falsch. Das Design an sich ist nicht schlecht aber warum spart man bei einem neuen Modell an einem neuen Design?Meiner Meinung nach an der falschen Stelle gespart.Abgesehen davon war die Ionic so interessant, weil diese eben ein ganz anderes Design hatte. Schlank, etwas größer und eckig.Warum macht man die Sense also nicht auch eher in die Richtung? Für mich absolut unverständlich und daher ein Negativer Punkt in meiner Bewertung.Wenn ich ein anderes Modell kaufe, hätte ich mir auch eine andere Optik gewünscht, vor allem wenn die halt 100€ mehr kostet.Ansonsten wirkt die Uhr solide! Qualität wirkt soweit super, Spaltmaße ebenso.Das Design an sich ist wie erwähnt sicher nicht schlecht, auch wenn ich oft nicht verstehe warum das Display nicht mehr an die Ränder geht, so wie andere Hersteller das auch hinbekommen.Ich finde das sieht dann immer nicht ganz so hochwertig aus, einfach weil wir alle wissen was heutzutage Möglich ist. Dies passiert vermutlich auch aus Kostengründen.► Ein paar Technische Daten zur Uhr- Kompatibilität: Android ab 7.0 / iOS ab 12.2- AMOLED Display- WLAN 802.11 b/g/n (2,4 GHz)- GPS / GLONASS- NFC- Bluetooth 5.0- EDA-Sensor- EKG- SpO2 Messung (Sättigung des Blutes)- Hauttemperatur- wasserdicht bis 5 Metern Tiefe- 6 Tage AkkulaufzeitDas sind die Daten womit geworben wird.► Akku/LaufzeitDer Akku bzw. die Akkulaufzeit ist eines der größten Faktoren bei einer Smartwatch.Ist diese zu kurz, ist der Spaß an der Uhr recht schnell vorbei.Denn der Sinn an so einem Fitnesstracker ist ja eigentlich möglichst viel von seinem Körper ""aufzunehmen"" also zu Tracken und zu speichern.Das ist natürlich nicht Möglich, wenn man täglich die Uhr für mehrere Minuten oder teilweise Stunden (bei anderen Herstellern) ablegen muss.Hier muss man sagen, war Fitbit schon immer eine der Top Uhren.Bereits meine Ionic hat locker mal 3-4 Tage gehalten.Die Sense wird nun aber mit 6+ Tagen angegeben, je nachdem wie man diese natürlich nutzt. (Kennen wir ja alle, wie die Hersteller immer werben...)Das ist vom Hersteller natürlich auch wieder um den heißen Brei geredet. Allerdings würde ich schon schätzen das sie vielleicht etwas länger als meine Ionic hält und ist somit trotzdem von der Akkulaufzeit her eine der besten Uhren auf dem Markt.Dank der Schnellaufladefunktion ist die Uhr aber auch nachdem der Akku leer ist, schnell wieder geladen.Fitbit wirbt zwar mit 12 Minuten und dann reicht es einen ganzen Tag, allerdings ist das natürlich alles Nutzungsabhängig.Sie lädt zwar schnell auf, allerdings nicht schneller als manche Konkurrenz. Was allerdings nicht schlimm ist, denn die Konkurrenz hält dafür nicht so lang.Die geworbenen 12 Minuten laden die Uhr übrigens nicht voll, sondern nur rein rechnerisch so viel, das sie einen Tag lang halten ""könnte"".► BedienungDie Bedienung ist wie bei allen Fitbit Uhren natürlich sehr einfach und schön geregelt.Die App leitet einen durch die komplette Installation und zeigt einem was alles Möglich ist.Ansonsten ist die Uhr genauso übersichtlich gestaltet wie bisherige Modelle auch. Dort sind tatsächlich keine großen Unterschiede.Vieles ist über die Uhr selbst aber auch über die Fitbit App zu verändern und anzupassen.Ich muss allerdings sagen, das der neuartige Sensorknopf mega nervt!Total schlecht zu bedienen, man muss irgendwie immer die richtige Position treffen usw.► EDA-SensorDer neuartige EDA-Sensor ist eigentlich DIE Neuheit bei der Fitbit Sense.EDA heißt übrigens Elektrodermale Aktivität.Der Sensor misst die im Grunde die Haut. Beispielsweise durch Schweiß.Die Uhr soll so erkennen, ob man z.B. man unter ""Stress"" steht.Dafür gibt es im System (also bei den Apps) eine App Namens EDA-Scan.Dort kann man einen ""schnellen Scan"" starten, welcher dann 2 Minuten geht. Währenddessen wird empfohlen das man die Uhr an den Arm drücken soll, damit die Kontakte vom Sensor tatsächlich aufliegen. Hier muss ich sagen, irgendwie schon blöd gelöst oder? Warum muss ich die andrücken? Warum sind die Sensoren nicht besser gesetzt?Also irgendwie schon blöd 2 Minuten lang seine Uhr auf den Arm zu drücken.Der Stress Test wird dann wieder ganz normal, wie alle Daten, in der Fitbit App gesammelt/gespeichert und dort dann ausgewertet.► Rückseite (Weitere Sensoren und Aufladen der Uhr)Die Rückseite sieht sehr aufgeräumt aus. Sehr sortiert und gleichmäßig und gut verarbeitet.Neben dem eben erwähnten EDA-Sensor hat die Fitbit Sense natürlich auch weitere Sensoren.Darunter zum Beispiel einen Sensor, welcher jede Nacht die Körpertemperatur misst.Ist die Temperatur abweichend, so wird die Uhr laut Fitbit anschlagen. Ob das natürlich geht, kann ich bisher noch nicht feststellen, da ich bisher Gesund bin.Toll ist aber auch der GPS Sensor, welchen einige kleinere Fitbit Versionen ebenfalls nicht hatten.Damit lässt sich also auch ohne mitführen des Smartphones z.B. beim Fahrradfahren eine Strecke erstellen.(Der GPS Sensor war übrigens damals der Grund für meinen Kauf der Ionic)Weiterhin gibt es ansonsten die üblichen Fitbit Tracker, also Strecken, Kalorienverbrennung usw. Das übliche eben!Ich denke dazu brauche ich nicht so viel erzählen.► Ladestation/ZubehörÜber die Ladestation hat man bisher ziemlich wenig gehört gehabt.Diese ist im Grunde aber recht einfach. Ziemlich genau so groß wie die Unterseite der Uhr.(Siehe meine Bilder)Die Uhr wird dabei einfach auf die Ladestation gelegt und lädt dann recht schnell auf.Gibt sicher schnellere Aufladestationen (Beispiel: Oppo Watch) allerdings hält die Fitbit Sense wenigstens recht lange, was bei der Konkurrenz oft das Problem ist.Schnell laden aber schnell leer, bringt mir im Endeffekt weniger Tragezeit, als wenn ich etwas länger laden muss aber dafür halt nicht täglich.Zubehör wird es für die Fitbit Sense eine Menge geben, denn die Versa 3 ist ja ebenfalls neu auf dem Markt und hat eigentlich genau das selbe Design.Hier ist der einzige Vorteil, warum die Fitbit Sense gleich ist.Für mich aber kein Grund ein neues Modell wie ein anderes aussehen zu lassen, denn im Grunde hätte man den Verschluss der Armbänder zum Beispiel ja identisch machen können und der Sense z.B. ein etwas eckigeres Design geben können.Mitgeliefert wird übrigens ein Armband in Größe S sowie eins in L. Also eigentlich sollte jeder erstmal direkt die Uhr nutzen können.Auch dies ist bei manchen Herstellern um einiges schlechter!Mein Favorit bei den Armbändern ist übrigens das Perforierte Lederarmband von Horween, direkt von Fitbit vertrieben.Es gibt zwar massig Hersteller aus China, die günstigere anbieten, allerdings zeigt sich dies immer in der Qualität.Auch bei meiner Ionic habe ich das Perforierte Lederarmband direkt von Fitbit. Einfach Top!► Farb- bzw. ModellauswahlZur Auswahl gibt es zum Start der Uhr zwei Möglichkeiten.Einmal die ""Mondweiß/Edelstahl Softgold"" Version sowie die ""Carbon/Edelstahl Graphit"" Version.Würde mal sagen das die eine eher Frauen anspricht und die andere eher Männer bzw. Fans von schlichteren Farben (Schwarz).Finde die Auswahl aber ganz gut. Viel mehr braucht man eigentlich nicht. Silber wäre natürlich schön gewesen aber wird bestimmt irgendwann auch kommen.Bei der neuen Versa3 im selben Design gibt es Schwarz, Altrosa/Softgold und noch Nachtblau/Softgold.Die letzten beiden Unterscheiden sich aber nur im Armband, mehr nicht.Direkt mehr Auswahl bei den Armbändern hätte ich mir auch bei der Sense gewünscht. Hätte es am liebsten direkt mit dem eben erwähnten perforierten Lederarmband gekauft.► BetriebssystemDas System ist wie bei Fitbit üblich ganz gut aufgebaut.Es ist so an sich recht flüssig und wirkt auch gut strukturiert.Allerdings hatte ich bei den älteren Modellen von Fitbit ständig Probleme mit dem Syncronisieren.So hat die Uhr teilweise tagelang nicht syncronisiert. Ich hoffe das ist hier nun verbessert.Sollte dies nicht der Fall sein, werde ich meine Bewertung natürlich zeitnah anpassen.Ansonsten gibt es eigentlich nicht viel zu sagen. Alles wie man erwartet hat.► Sense oder Versa 3?Kurz mal diese Frage eingeworfen für diejenigen, die unschlüssig sind!Wer gerne mehr Tracken möchte, also EDA-Scan (Stresstest) und Körpertemperatur (+ Warnung), der sollte zur Sense greifen.Will man das allerdings nicht bzw. braucht man das nicht, dann wird die Versa 3 vollkommen ausreichen!Immerhin sind das 100€ Unterschied, für nur ein paar Kleinigkeiten. Da muss jeder selbst wissen ob einem das Wert ist.Ich denke der Aufpreis ist nur gegeben, da in der Sense viel neue Technik ist, welche recht neu auf dem Markt ist.Anders hätte man vermutlich die 100€ Aufpreis nicht bewerben können, ohne einen neuen Namen. Auch deshalb wieder echt blöd, das man kein eigenes Design dafür überlegt hat!► Kaufempfehlung/FazitPositive Punkte:- Hochwertige Haptik/Qualität- Schnelles Betriebssystem (auch wenn es ausgereifter sein könnte)- Sehr tolles Display mit richtig guten Farben- Großer Akku mit viel Laufzeit- Tolle Auswahl an Zubehör (Fitbit üblich)- Geringes GewichtNegative Punkte:- Kein eigenes Modelldesign (Minus Punkt hierfür)- Kein Google Pay (Nur Fitbit Pay mit wenig Banken die das unterstützen, also eigentlich nicht nutzbar)- Nerviger SensorknopfDer Sensorknopf war wohl eher gewollt als gekonnt von Fitbit.Da Frage ich mich tatsächlich, wer sich das ausgedacht und ausgetestet hat. Man muss so nervig und verkrampft den Knopf drücken und das bei so einer teuren Uhr?Wie bei jeder Fitbit ist die Uhr eher eine Fitnessuhr und keine Smartwatch im klassischen Sinne. Das merkt man natürlich anhand der ganzen Gesundheitsaspekte/Apps.Sämtliche Sensoren die alles Mögliche Messen weisen bereits darauf hin. Finde ich aber auch soweit ganz gut!Was ich allerdings total schlecht finde, das Fitbit Pay immer noch kein PayPal, keine Visa Karten bzw. an sich mehr Banken anbietet.Man kann praktisch diese Funktion kaum oder gar nicht nutzen und das ist echt traurig!Dadurch ist die Uhr halt wirklich eher eine Uhr um sich selbst zu tracken und vielleicht mal die Uhrzeit abzulesen. Mehr eigentlich auch nicht.Fraglich bleibt für mich aber bisher noch ob alte Probleme gelöst wurden. Beispielsweise gibt es einige Versa1 und Versa2 Kunden deren Uhren kaputt gegangen sind. Darunter meist durch Wassereinlagerungen in der Uhr nach dem Schwimmen. Hoffen wir das Fitbit das Problem hier natürlich nicht hat. Auch hier werde ich nachliefern, falls mir etwas negativ auffällt.Kaufempfehlung: ✔️ JaDie Fitbit wirkt im großen und ganzen gelungen.Sollte es bei Fitbit Pay weitere Zahlungsmöglichkeiten geben, wäre das natürlich Weltklasse.Allgemein ist die Uhr auf dem Markt so bisher die beste Uhr, die ich hatte.Dazu sei aber gesagt, das ich kein Fan davon bin z.B. WhatsApp Nachrichten auf der Uhr zu lesen/schreiben oder ähnliches. Dafür hab ich schließlich mein Smartphone.Die Uhr kann aber Benachrichtigungen anzeigen, also das geht schon. Falls jetzt jemand sorge hatte.Vermutlich wird dies aber sehr auf den Akku schlagen!Wer also eine tolle Fitness Uhr sucht, die eine lange Akkulaufzeit, viele Sensoren und Möglichkeiten bietet, der wird hier fündig!Wer nicht ganz so viele Sensoren braucht sollte besser zur Versa 3 greifen und 100€ sparen!Ich behaupte das diese Uhr mit Abstand die bisher beste Uhr von Fitbit ist! 👍Dennoch gibt es ""nur"" 3 Sterne, da ich es schon echt Frech finde, eine teurere Uhr im Design einer günstigeren zu machen aber einfach einen neuen Namen zu verpassen um anzupreisen, dass es was viel besseres ist. Da hätte man sich halt einfach mehr Mühe geben können oder das Design der Ionic weiterführen und dort einfach die neuen Sensoren verbauen.Außerdem ist der Sensorknopf so dämlich gemacht, eine Frechheit bei dem Preis.An sich schwanke ich derzeit zwischen 2-3 Sternen, wegen der zwei-drei doch schon starken negativen Punkte.Mal sehen wie die Uhr auf dauer überzeugt! Dann werde ich die Bewertung natürlich noch anpassen!Danke fürs lesen meiner Rezension, ich hoffe ich konnte dir damit helfen 🙂\n', '\n  News (7.10.20): EKG App wird ausgerollt, somit kann ein 30 Sekunden EKG am Bildschirm der Uhr gemacht werden. Funktionsweise: mit Daumen und Zeigefinger diagonal Finger am Gehäuse wird Messung durchgeführt. Daten werden in der Fitbit App zu einem ""Bericht"" ausgewertet.((Nachträge - Updates -> werden unterhalb hinzugefügt.))Seit einem Jahr beschäftige ich mich mit ""Fitnesstrackern"" und habe mit\xa0 einem 25€ Fitnesstracker (besserer Schrittzähler mit Uhr und Pulsmesser, Akku läuft lange) gestartet, hatte zwischenzeitlich eine Garmin SmartWatch (Klotz! Täglich am Ladegerät, kaum Gesundheitsfunktionen) bin  dann zur Fitbit Versa 2 gelangt. (Ich habe mich Recht schnell in die Versa 2 verknallt.)Die Fitbit App in Kombination mit der Aufzeichnung und Auswertung der für mich wichtigen Daten war anfangs gewöhnungsbedürftig, nun begleitet sie mich täglich. Ich  schätze die Auswertungen, die in der App geboten werden. Und ich behalte im Blick wie ich schlafe, wie aktiv ich bin. Das sind auch meine zwei wichtigsten Funktionen.(Dennoch teile ich die Werte nicht bewusst mit Freunden oder der ganzen Welt.)Es war reine Neugier, die mich nun zum Kauf der Fitbit Sense verleitet hat. Neugierig war ich mehr auf das Stressmanagement, als auf alle anderen neuen Gimmicks, wie zum Beispiel GPS Integration.Mein Fazit vorab: ich hätte auch mit der Versa 2 gut weiterleben können. Die kostet aktuell die Hälfte der Sense. So wahnsinnig viel mehr bringt mir die Sense nämlich nicht. Ich geb ihr 3 Sterne weil sie mich nicht vom Hocker reißt und gemessen an meinen Erfahrungen und Erwartungen eher enttäuschend. (In den Nachträgen erkläre ich, warum es schließlich nur 1 Stern ist.)Zu den mir relevanten Punkten gehe ich in Schlagworten einzeln ein. Man mag sich bitte selbst ein Gesamtbild machen, welche Funktionen einem wichtig erscheinen.Armband: maximale Enttäuschung, aus mehreren Gründen:(-) Armband löst sich selbständig vom Gehäuse!!! -> No-Go! Hätte fast meine Uhr im freien auf einem Acker verloren. (Siehe Nachtrag 2)(-) Silikon:\xa0 Ich kaufe eine Fitnesstracker um mich nachhaltig und achtsam zu verhalten, und dann wieder ein allerbilligstes Silikon Armband!? Bei der Fitbit Versa 2 bekam ich nach 7 Tagen (dauerhaft tragen) eine unschöne Hautreaktion. Habe dann Gewebe und Leder Armband bachgekauft, das war nicht extra teuer, aber sinnvoll!(-) Ersatz Armband? Für die Fitbit Sense (und Versa 3) gibt es noch keine Ersatz Armbänder, die nicht auch aus Silikon wären.Die Fitbit Sense und Versa 3 haben ein neues Befestigungs-System zum Armband Wechsel. -> das find ich extrem blöd!Ich kann gar nicht sagen wie viele Stunden ich schon gesucht und recherchiert habe. Für die Versa 3 und Sense findet man noch keine ""Generika"" Armbänder aus Leder, das ärgert mich im Moment extrem, da ich die Uhr mit dem Silikon Armband (Original) nicht dauerhaft tragen werde können.(-) Stressmanagement: neue Funktion. Muss man aber aktiv messen, nennt sich EDA Scan. Dauert 2 Minuten (Handfläche auf Uhr legen).Ich wollte das im Laufe eines ""bewegten"" Arbeitstages machen, stell aber fest dass mich das zusätzlich aufregt, wenn ich 2 Minuten beide Hände blockiere um Stress zu messen, nur damit ich weiß dass ich mich gestresst fühle? Irgendwie habe ich da was anderes erwartet.(+/-) Fitbit Premium? Habe für 3 Monate\xa0 Fitbit Premium kostenlos ""aktiviert"", kann jetzt im Moment nur sagen dass die vielen guten Statistiken durchaus beeindruckend sind, aber ich kann das nicht mehr so einfach von der ""Standard"" Variante unterscheiden, da mit der neuen Versa/ Sense Generation auch in der normalen App neue Funktionalitäten dazu gekommen sind.Bei Fitbit Premium ärgert mich, dass viele Unterstützungen in deutscher Sprache angepriesen werden, dann aber nur in Englisch verfügbar. Auch bei Hilfe Seiten ist das der Fall. Wenn ich recherchieren möchte wie die Stressmanagement Messung oder Hauttemperatur Messung ausgewertet wird und überhaupt ... lande ich auf Fitbit Seiten im Englischer Sprache.\xa0Das überzeugt nicht wirklich.Werde Premium dann Rechtzeitig kündigen.(-/+) Premium Mitgliedschaft?Es kursieren auch unterschiedliche Angaben, wieviel Premium (/Jahr) schließlich kosten soll. Rund 100€ muss man wohl berappen.Bin noch unschlüssig ob es mir das Wert ist.(-) Geführte Trainings und Meditationen. Werden in der App angeboten, sind aber größtenteils in Englisch verfügbar. Gefällt mir gar nicht.(+) Schlaf Auswertung: Die überzeugt mich weiterhin. Kenn ich ja schon von der Versa 2.\xa0 Mir bringt das wirklich viele Erkenntnisse und somit auch Hebel zur Optimierung. Die Sauerstoffsättigung (SPO2) gibt\'s schon bei der Versa 2. Bei Versa 3/ Sense nichts neues. Aber das ist nun mal überzeugend.(+) Schrittzähler. Den finde ich auch zuverlässig (wie bereits in Versa 2). Mit einigen Tätigkeiten ist der Schrittzähler freilich überfordert. Mountainbiken oder Motorradfahren. Hier werden wohl Erschütterungen gezählt. Das habe ich jetzt zur Kenntnis genommen und es stört mich nicht.(+) Aktiv-Minuten Zähler: Klasse! Zeigt mir am Ende eines Homeoffice Tages super was ich hätte besser machen können.Am Ende eines Haushalt- und Garten-Tages auch spannend!Ne, im Ernst: man kann sich nicht immer den ganzen Tag aktiv und regelmäßig bewegen, und wenn man solche wenig aktiven Tage hat, kann man mit zusätzlichem Sport noch etwas entgegen wirken. Mich motiviert das jedenfalls. Auch aus dem Grund weil ich weiß wie schnell sich Verspannungen und Trägheit in Kopfschmerzen/ Nackenschmerzen bemerkbar machen.(+) Treppen Zähler? Ich dachte, dass sowas nie hinkommen kann, aber Pustekuchen. Die Sensorik in der Fitbit Versa 2 bekam das schon hin und auch in der Sense wird hier zuverlässig gezählt.(+) Hauttemperatur Messung: das ist mir noch zu neu, als dass ich hier viel dazu sagen könnte. Vielleicht wird es relevant wenn Schnupfen oder Erkältung im Anmarsch. So lange man gesund ist, schlägt hier nix aus...Die Hauttemperatur Messung ist jedenfalls neu im Vergleich zur Versa 2! Ich setze noch große Hoffnungen in diese Messungen und mögliche Erkenntnisse daraus.(-/+) Trainings Optionen:Es gibt schön viele Sportarten für die es Trainings Erkennung gibt, und die man auch manuell starten kann. Was mir noch immer fehlt, ist Ergometer (Fahrrad). Meine Lieblings Aktivität zwischendurch Zuhause ist nicht als solche auswählbar, das find ich enttäuschend. Immerhin gibt es nun Crosstrainer als neue Option. Oder auch Spinning.Das ist allerdings nicht so von bahnbrechender Bedeutung. Man kann ja am Puls die Fettverbrennungszonen erkennen, sofern man sich ein wenig damit beschäftigt/ auskennt.Die automatische Trainings Erkennung funktioniert gut, aber hier lege ich nicht unbedingt Wert darauf. Ich bin kein Sport Freak, mir geht es darum regelmäßig motiviert zu werden um fit zu bleiben.(+/-) Lade Zyklus: Angegeben mit 6 Tagen. Hängt aber schwer davon ab wie man das Display einstellt. Im Rahmen erster Tests alle Funktionen und verschiedene Ziffernblätter hat der Akku zwei Tage geschafft, ist dann aber wie versprochen ratzfatz aufgeladen.(!) Ladegerät für Versa 3/ Sense ist übrigens nicht mehr identisch mit Versa 2! Es sind 4 Pins die magnetisch an der Rückseite der Uhr abkoppeln. Das Ladegerät ist ein wenig praktischer als der ""Käfig"" von der Versa 2.Eine Ladestation kann man optional nachkaufen, für mich aber nicht erstrebenswert.(+) Bedienung am Display. Da ich durch die Versa 2 schon ein wenig Übung habe, komm ich mit der Sense gut klar. Zumindest beim wischen am Schirm.Ich finde die Bedienung von solchen Fitnesstracker-Bildschirmen immer etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, vor allem wenn dann nicht das passiert was man durch ""wischen"" erreichen hat wollen.(+/-) neues Versa iOS:Mit dem neuen iOS der Versa 3 und Sense kamen wohl neue Menü-  und Wisch-Optionen hinzu. Ich bin selbst ganz überrascht, dass ich das alles sofort verinnerlicht hab. Tippen, wischen nach oben/ unten / links ... Alles unterschiedlich belegt.Extrem unschön finde ich es, dass Fitbit dieses neue iOS nicht auch älteren Fitbit Modellen spendieren wird. :-((-) kein Bedienknopf mehr links am Gehäuse. Das ärgert mich tatsächlich sehr. Sehr. SEHR!Da ich kein Always On Ziffernblatt eingestellt habe, muss ich immer an der Uhr links mit einem Finger länger am Sensor dran bleiben, bis der Bildschirm angeht. Das nervt! Bei der Versa 2 war es ein Knopf -> man hat einmal draufgedrückt und Zack! Bildschirm an. Das ging mit dem Zeigefinger der anderen Hand.Diesen\xa0 versenkten Sensor den die Sense verbaut hat, betätigt man richtig schwer, unhandlich mit viel Verzögerung und das nervt extrem.Man kann diesen versenkten Sensor Knopf entweder einmal länger oder zwei Mal kurz drücken und dann in den Einstellungen verschiedene Schnellzugriff Optionen anwählen.Ich habe es bisher nicht geschafft zu kapieren, wie man zwei Mal drückt. Keine Chance. Keine Ahnung was ich hier falsch mache.DER SENSOR KNOPF NERVT.(+) Aussehen: Ist natürlich total subjektiv, diese ""Bewertung"", doch mir gefällt das Äußere, der Schirm\xa0 und Rahmen sehen brilliant aus, alles sehr hochwertig. (Bei dem Preis soll das ja auch so sein.)Gefallen tut mir die Sense durchaus.(+) Nachrichten anzeigen vom Handy auf dem Bildschirm der Sense? Funktioniert tadellos.Habe diese Option nach einem Tag abgestellt. Brauche ich nicht. Alle Push Meldungen vom Handy werden am Schirm angezeigt. Man kann sogar WhatsApp Meldungen als gelesen markieren oder kurze Antwort senden.Das - und viele weitere Funktionen - machen die Sense zur SmartWatch.(GPS) Im Vergleich zu den Vorgängern hat Sense und Versa 3 den GPS Sensor in der Uhr eingebaut! Das heißt, man kann -wenn man auf Aufzeichnung der Strecke besteht- ohne Handy laufen gehen und alles aufs Handy (die App) synchronisieren.Das ist eine Funktion die sehr oft gewünscht und angefragt wurde.Mich interessiert diese GPS Funktion allerdings nicht.Ich nehme Handy zum laufen und Mountainbiken immer mit. Ich weiß ja nicht was passiert und in Pausen brauch ich es zum fotografieren.(...) Es gibt wesentlich mehr Funktionen, wie Sprachsteuerung und bezahlen Funktionen, die mich zurzeit nicht interessieren. Darum kann ich hierzu nichts berichten.(-) Display Schutz wäre auf jeden Fall auch angebracht, hier\xa0bin ich von Fitbit enttäuscht. Dass man bei weit über dreihundert Euro nicht ein Stück Folie mit dazu geben kann, finde ich enttäuschend.Meine Erfahrungen mit Display Schutz bei der Versa 2 sind sehr gut. Ich werde auch für die Sense eine Folie kaufen.Ob diese Hüllen - die ich Irrsinnig praktisch und schmückend finde! - in Kombination mit dem dämlichen, versenkten Sensor Knopf funktionieren können, müsste ich erstmal recherchieren.Die Hüllen gibt es in lustigen Farben, so eine Hülle ist schnell drüber gestülpt und schützt maximal. Vermutlich geht dann EDA (Stress) Scan auch nicht mehr.Hier müsste man abwägen ob man für robuste Tätigkeiten sich nicht besser doch eine Hülle zulegt.!!! Die Hüllen für Versa 2 passen übrigens auf die Sense/ Versa 3 drauf. Der Bedienknopf geht dann halt nur nicht mehr.**********Fazit habe ich ja bereits oben erwähnt: Ein bisschen ärgere ich mich, weil ich diese teure Uhr gekauft habe. Ich hätte mich weniger geärgert wenn sie die Hälfte gekostet hätte. Da es bei solchen Produkten allerdings üblich ist, gehe ich davon aus, dass auch hier der Preis noch sinken wird. Es ist und bleibt jedoch eine subjektive Entscheidung, wieviel einem so ein smarter Tracker wert ist.Und freilich behaupte ich nicht, dass man überhaupt einen benötigt! (Bei mir ist es jedenfalls so: ich bin dieser Art Auswertung meiner Lebenszeichen regelrecht ausgeliefert :-)Nachtrag:Die Bedienung mit dem Sensor Knopf ist für mich im Moment absolut indiskutabel. Ich finde hier einfach Null System darin. Ersatz Armband oder Hülle oder Display Schutz würde ich erst kaufen wenn geklärt ist ob ich sie nicht zurück sende.Nachtrag 2:3 auf 2 Sterne geändert.Gestern fiel mir mitten auf einem Acker, ich hatte gerade Blumen gepflückt, die Uhr vom Handgelenk. Eine Armband Befestigung hatte sich selbständig vom Gehäuse gelöst. ->ein absolutes No-Go!Zum Glück habe ich es gehört wie die Uhr auf den Boden fiel. Im Gras hätte ich das niemals gehört. Beim Laufen oder Mountainbiken auch äußerst unwahrscheinlich dass man das rechtzeitig merkt.Die Befestigung des Armbandes am Uhrgehäuse funktioniert anders als noch bei der Versa 2. Es ist eine Art kleiner Knopf den man drückt um ein Armband zu lösen. Das Armband wird ohne Betätigung eines Pins wieder befestigt. Es fühlt sich an als ob das Armband Ende magnetisch ans Uhrgehäuse andockt. In Wirklichkeit ist es aber ein gut geführtes ""stecken und verhaken""-System.Diese Neuerung an der Versa 3/ Sense finde ich extrem kundenunfreundlich und das Gegenteil von Nachhaltig. Es bedeutet dass man Armbänder von Vorgänger Uhren wegwerfen kann. Es bedeutet dass man zunächst nur ein Original von Fitbit kaufen kann.Für Fitbit mag das ein gutes Geschäftsmodell sein, für mich als Kunde ist es ärgerlich. Zumal die neue Art der Befestigung für mich ein Konstruktionsfehler ist.Nachtrag 3. Heute beim Laufen hab ich dauernd aufgepasst ob ich die Uhr nicht wieder verliere.Beim aktivieren der Sportart habe ich wie üblich wieder zig Versuche benötigt um mit dem Sensor Knopf die Bedienung überhaupt zu aktivieren. Da hätte theoretisch schon das Stressmanagement anschlagen können - vorausgesetzt man versteht überhaupt was das Stressmanagement macht und wozu es gut ist.Zumal meine Begeisterung sich wegen des billigen Silikon Armbandes auf den ersten Blick in Grenzen gehalten hat, und weil ich die Uhr nicht verlieren möchte, ehe ich sie zurück sende, hab ich beschlossen die Sense wegen dieser Mängel zurück zu senden.Gerne hätte ich noch weiter probiert was die neuen Auswertungen so für Erkenntnisse nach sich ziehen, aber das Risiko die 330€  einfach so vom Handgelenk zu schütteln... ist mir jetzt doch zu hoch. Der permanente Stress den mir die Bedienung beschert kommt erschwerend hinzu. Vielleicht ist an meinem Gerät aber auch etwas defekt an dem Sensor Knopf!?Grundsätzlich  sehe ich das auch selbständige lösen des Armbandes das tatsächlich als groben Mangel.Nachtrag 4 - der vorerst letzte:Vor der Rücksendung wollte ich in der App noch einmal die ""Tagesleistung"" überprüfen und stelle fest, dass seit gestern keine Synchronisierung stattgefunden hat. Aha. Seltsam... Das ist insofern seltsam, weil die App für ""heute"" exakt die Schritte anzeigt, wie sie auch auf dem Bildschirm der Uhr angezeigt werden. Trotzdem sagt mir die App seit einer Stunde dass keine Synchronisierung möglich ist.Vermutlich wird die Sense wieder einmal nicht gefunden. Vergleichbare Probleme hatte ich bereits mit der Versa 2. Einmal ging sogar gar nichts mehr. Mit Unterstützung des Kundenservice (zuerst Amazon, dann weitergeleitet an Fitbit Support) gelang es dann wieder die Uhr mit der App zusammen zu bringen (in Kurzform: Fitbit App deinstallieren, Speicher leeren, App neu installieren, Uhr neu anmelden).Wenn das alle paar Monate mal passiert, mag man da noch darüber hinwegsehen. Der Versa 2 habe ich diesen einmaligen Ausrutscher bereits verziehen. Ich habe auch schon von Fällen gelesen wo die Uhr sich überhaupt nicht mehr verbinden ließ. Das ist dann freilich bitter ... Und man kann nur hoffen dass in solchen Fällen noch Garantie/ Rücksendung/ Kulanz Ersatz besteht.Grundsätzlich gilt: wenn eine Fitbit Uhr durch eine andere ersetzt wird, meldet man sich freilich mit seinem eigenen Account neu an. Alle bisher gespeicherten Daten sind dann weiterhin verfügbar! (Das ist das Tolle an der Cloud. Das ist das Fragwürdige an der Cloud. Kann man so oder so sehen.)Nachdem ich von der Versa 2 auf die Sense umgestiegen bin, sind meine bisherigen Daten und Statistiken weiterhin vorhanden. Durch die Sense kamen nur neuere Werte hinzu, die es eben vorher nicht gab.Wenn ich nun auf die Versa 2 zurück gehe, läuft das auch alles wie gehabt weiter.Nachtrag 5:NEU: es gibt jetzt die EKG App!(!!!) Herzfrequenz Messung. Hier habe ich beunruhigende Infos gefunden. Die Herzfrequenz Messwerte sind nicht zuverlässig und wenn ich das YouTube Video von Quantified Scientist im Kontext mit den vielen kritischen Stimmen zur Pulsmessung ansehe, dann wird es extrem ärgerlich. Die Fitbit Sense misst in oberen Bereichen verzögert (Messung laggt). Die positive Vermutung dahinter: das ist ein Software Problem. Anders herum, wenn es nämlich ein Hardware Problem wäre, wäre es ein k.o. Kriterium für diese Uhr. Man muss also hoffen, dass der Fehler bald behoben wird und wer aktuelle und zuverlässige Pulsmessung haben möchte, sollte mit einem Brustgurt Gerät (Polar) messen.-> In dem Kontext, dass es eine Benachrichtigungsfunktion für hohe/ niedrige Pulsfrequenz gibt, auf die man sich ja verlassen können sollte, ist dieser Fehler bei der Messung alleine schon sehr kurios.Es ist schon eine ziemliche Zumutung, dass Fitbit solche unausgereifte Produkte auf Kunden loslässt. Ich möchte den Zahlen ja auch vertrauen können.((((-: genug Gemecker ... ihre Entscheidung :-))))Nichtsdestoweniger wünsche ich allen stolzen Käufern, aber auch den ""Testern"" viel Freude damit ... Und viel Glück damit auch. :-p\n', ""\n  Do not buy it yet, it is unfinished. None of the features that advertised before is working. Google assistant, ecg, making / taking calls etc is not available yet.Mobile App is useless. You cannot update or download any application nor change any clock face. It gets stucked in the process of downloading and red line constantly moves from left to right in download bar. As expected no viable solution yet apart of resetting, clearing cache, turning off / on Bluetooth.. Etc. ( none of them worked).Eda sensor do not tell you much, can't figure out how to tackle stress management through the app with no direction, don't know where to look, what to look and more importantly we don't know how accurate is that. Blood Oxygen level can only work with one single watch face, and if you are lucky to download it through app which I failed, go ahead and test it. Right now this function is useless for me as well. Os is so buggy and sluggish. Do not expect fast scrolling like Apple, Samsung offers. That touch button on the left and side is hard to reach and not comfortable to use not to mention how buggy it is.Seriously I do not understand where those 5 star ratings coming from. This watch is clearly not finished, and was released too soon. I guess Fitbit is using us to do beta testing. How come I abondon my galaxy watch to buy this. Do not buy it yet until they fix it properly. Do some online research, this watch does not deserve that price tag.\n"", ""\n  Having used Fitbits for many years - all the way back to the days of the first Fitbit Flex, I have upgraded over the years to the Charge, the Charge HR, Charge 2, the Versa I, the Versa 2 and now excitedly the Fitbit Sense.LOOKSThe Fitbit sense has basically the same look as the Versa series. If you liked the Versa 2, you won't really notice much of a change compared to that model and given its heftier weight feels more premium. The strap attachment is much improved with a clicking release mechanism that pops out the strap rather than a really fiddly tiny pin that you can lose and can break with ease.FITBIT OS 5.0The Sense and Versa 3 are the only devices utilising the newer Fitbit OS (which they have claimed to be the most meaningful so far). Its a bit cleaner than the prior OS with a new font.GPSGPS is a major upgrade that the fitbit universe fans have been screaming for since day 1 the versa came out. Having GPS means you dont have to worry about carrying your phone with you when you are out in order to track a ride or a run. Connected GPS was also very unreliable so most of the time you would have trouble with the connectivity anyways so having GPS on your wrist is a massive upgrade and takes around 10 seconds to connect. Of course the battery life with GPS is massively diminished, but that is to be expected as you wouldn't use GPS mode 24/7 anyways.NEW SENSORS - EDA / ECGEDA is supposed to be a electrical conductivity test which tracks your stress levels. Seems a bit gimicky as you need to put your hand over the watch to take a test with an app.Similarly ECG will test for atrial fibrillation which means irrelgular heart rhythm which can lead to strokes etc. and are a symptom of clots. You need to touch the top and bottom corners of the fitbit to access this reading and is not a constant reading similar to the EDA sensor. Both of these sensors have now been cleared by the relevant US and European health authorities for use. This was an impressive feat as I believe a lot of devices are still pending (aside from the Apple watch), and Fitbit managed to get this through in what seemed like record time.. I can’t as of yet test the ECG sensor as the feature is not yet available but will update this review once I can. The EDA sensor on the other hand, i have tried. 2 minutes is a long time to put your hand up. It hasn't really given me any meaningful information as of yet but will update as and when I do.BUTTONSFitbit has gone away with moving parts for this smart watch. It now has haptic feedback instead of physical buttons. I like the fact that its more sleep without moving parts but a part of me does enjoy having a button to press. It feels more real as an experience and the good travel of the Fitbit versa 2 button made it a satisfying process.SPEEDThe Fitbit Sense is supposed to have upgraded speed compared versa 2. But it’s around the same in my opinion. When i first turned it on, it was very laggy (more so than my Versa 2). I was expecting a noticeable speed bump compared to its predecessor. In this way it feels like old tech in terms of its hardware.COMPATIBILITYThe Fitbit Sense has a new charger YET AGAIN! This means you can't use the old Versa 1 or Versa 2 charging cables. Fitbit loves making new products that aren't compatible with old chargers. Whilst this is disappointing the new cable is fast charging and magnetic which makes it look really cool when snapping it on and needing a quick 20 minute charge. As per the Versa 1 to Versa 2 upgrade, the watch faces are also compatible vs the older Versa, so there is already a massive existing library for you to customise your experience.BATTERY LIFEAccording to the specifications the battery life is supposed to last 6 days. This is 1 more than the Versa 2 and 2 more than the Versa 1. After a year with the Versa 2, the battery life has not decreased too significantly, (possibly 4 days without charge needed so some degradation) but this is expected with older devices. I will update in this review once I can put it to the full test. However, Fitbit over the years has lived up to the specifications on every device i have owned (except of course if it is defective). I would expect it to last the full 6 days as advertised. This is far far longer than any of Fitbits main competitors out there. The charging experience is fast. the charger clips on instead of the butterfly clip which is great.SHOULD YOU GET IT?If you already own a Versa 2, and it still works fine, then no - probably not, or you can probably consider upgrading to the Versa 3 as it pretty much has all the features of the above except for the ECA and ECG sensors for a 100 GBP less. If you have a Versa 1 or earlier, this is a big upgrade, and it has moved into the proper smart watch category. It's a worthy device to have and I would recommend it for anyone who doesn't have a Versa 2 and wants a smart watch.The Sense is expensive and a premium product and some of the new sensors do feel more gimmick than actual useful stats. However I do think Fitbit are on the verge of doing something great with all this data they have. The skin temperature sensors, the spo2, the EDA and ECG, all of these can potentially be used to detect earlier the presence of something being wrong with your body such as Covid. If you are into your tech and want the latest and greatest, then yes, the Fitbit sense has all of these in a tiny package and will not disappoint. They are a premium smart watch maker now and with the integrated Fitbit ecosystem, a hard value proposition to beat compared to its competitors. It only gets a 4 star because of its price relative to the meaningful information I am getting out of it at this current time. Will update experiences once i have the EDA and ECG properly tested.\n""]"

Fair warning though on some things I didn’t realize: you need Spotify premium to use any of the Spotify features at all which was kind of a bummer. And according to their website if you use the GPS feature the Fitbit battery only lasts 5 hours. So you have to be careful to turn GPS only on and off when you need it when you’re exercising and not just leave it on to auto recognize which is a little annoying but not a huge deal. Also a few features require that you allow them to run in the background for them to “work properly” I don’t like to have things do that to try and preserve my phone battery so I turned off those permissions but left the others on and so far I haven’t had any other problems because my Fitbit still syncs throughout the day and I think can still get data that way. My boyfriend loves the sleep mode feature that turns off notifications and screen wake so when I toss and turn at night I don’t accidentally blind him with my watch screen if it goes off.\n', ""\n  I won't be like everyone who gives a bad review because they clearly got a dud (or user-error as it often is). I'll give it an honest assessment.The app is amazing, that goes without saying. The quality of the band is nice, but it's a bit hefty, made bulkier by the textured diamond pattern in the band. The clasp is a bit cumbersome as well, and feels a bit like cheap plastic. I'll reserve my judgments on that until it breaks. Doesn't inspire confidence though.The watch itself seems to be very accurate, it's comfortable, and has some nice options. The pressure button on the side is a little hard to press, I wish you could change the settings for the sensitivity. When pressing, it requires you to stabilize the other side with your thumb or else you'll just push the watch causing it to slide toward your hand. The UI on the app is clean and simple, although I wish it allowed to customization. I don't need all the settings and stats it comes with, and many you cannot remove from the UI. This makes you scroll more than you'll probably want to to get to the features you like. If we could at least re-order them, that'd allow for quicker navigation.My final note is battery life. FitBit claims 7 days of battery life. Today is Thursday at 8:41pm. I'm at 70%. I gave it a full charge all night Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Within an hour of pulling it off the charger it was down by 5%. At the current rate, it'll likely be dead by Sunday which is closer to 4 days. Keep in mind, since I charged it fully, I have NOT exercised. It's quarantine and I'm lazy. I can imagine the battery would only last 2-3 days with moderate to heavy frequent exercise.That's my review. Don't got much else to say. It's a decent watch, but I'd wait for it to go on sale.\n"", ""\n  Fitbit's App:Let me start by saying, the Fitbit app is unparalleled for sleep, diet and water tracking. I have tried to move away from Fitbit due to my propensity for longer runs, but the features covered in their one app bring me back every time. Simply stated, it presents the most holistic picture you're going to get of your health inside ONE app as a result of wearing ONE fitness tracker.Charge 4 as an Upgrade (i.e. GPS):Specific to the Charge 4, with a note that *ALL OTHER THINGS ARE EQUAL CALIBER TO THE CHARGE 3*, the GPS (which is really the only major new feature of the Charge 4) is good. The GPS takes seconds (maybe 10 to 20) to connect and then you touch the screen and off you go. I wore the Charge 4 and my Garmin for the first few runs to compare tracking (my garmin is a triathlon model, not a fitness tracker model, & used more for races and longer distance running due to battery life) and the GPS paired fairly well across both units. The Fitbit found its satellites far quicker than Garmin, but seemingly gives extra distance when going around corners. I have one corner I hit on my out and back 3 miles runs and the GPS maps indicate this is where the magic happened, but that being said I would usually hit the 3 mile mark on the Charge 4 around two or three strides ahead of my Garmin. No biggie for the shorter/daily training runs. I would say the Fitbit Charge 4 stops being your optimal choice if 1. You are fine with carrying your phone constantly and therefore do not need GPS or 2. you are going to be out doing your activity for 2.5-3+ hours. That's where the battery use for GPS expenditure becomes cumbersome. At a moderately paced half marathon, you're into Garmin/Coros/Suunto/etc.Special Edition or Base:Specific to the Charge 4, the special edition boils down to a unique band, that happens to be absolute junk (with reflective fabric!). The super special band looks a bit awkward with the unit, won't survive sweat for very long without needing to be washed or soaked, and felt & looked like it didn't fully connect into the unit at the clip ins and might randomly separate it tugged on the wrong way. (Could have been mine was defective, I don't know) my recommendation either way- save the $20 bucks, get the basic Charge 4, and if you're into colored/specialty bands, any band that is marketed for the Charge 3 or 4 will work with the Charge 4. I am currently using the Charge 3 special edition band (white rubber with black clasps) on my charge 4. It works perfectly.Out Of The Box: I had no issues with any part of charging it, pairing it, or the firmware updates needed at launch to bring it to current. No black screens of death either.Battery Life:And the battery does die faster when using GPS, but that actually happens to all fitness trackers not expressly made for GPS monitoring. You can't have built-in GPS tracking on a unit THIS size, with ALL the fitness tracking features it has, and expect battery to last a full week. With active GPS use for an activity a day plus all day & night wear/fitness tracking, I'd estimate you'll get 3 to 4 days out of each charge.\n"", ""\n  I finally received my Fitbit and unfortunately it just has a black screen. I followed all directions, which is charging it and pairing it up to my phone. But as it was paring, the screen just turned black and when my phone tries to finish the set up and asks me for a 4 number pin, I can't type them in because I can't see them. I tried a reset by placing the fitbit on a charger, and nothing happened. There is a vibration when I press the button, but nothing more. I really needed this to work by tomorrow and now this happens. It's a great disappointment.\n"", '\n  So just like another review on here ... my fitbit will not turn on during the setup ... it will slightly vibrate when I press the side button but the screen will not turn on at all.  So disappointed ... will try more but I think I will be returning it tomorrow 😥🥺  Update!!! I got it working and now it seems to be good ... steps are accurate and also the GPS is great.  Originally marked it as a 1 star but bumped it up to 3 since it is working well now.\n', ""\n  A single 10k run (c. 1 hour 20 minutes, incl. warm up and cool down) took the battery from 60% to 9%Absolutely no chance of using this to track a half marathon, then...Update:. Battery life seems to have become a bit better after a firmware update. However, it's the distance tracking that's now making it unusable.  It's widely optimistic, with every run coming in 15-20% over the actual distance, checked against maps and Strava!\n"", '\n  Voller Begeisterung habe ich (Besitzer der Charge 2 und eigentlich sehr zufrieden) mir die Charge 4 gekauft, denn endlich gabs hier die 2 Dinge, die ich bei meiner Charge 2 bis jetzt vermisst habe: GPS im Tracker und eine gewisse Wasserdichtheit. Als der Tracker ankam, wollte ich sofort loslegen. Bedienungsanleitung war nicht in der Verpackung, aber der Hinweis, dass ich über die App in meinem Smartphone den Tracker hinzufügen soll und dort durch das Menü geführt werde. Also startete ich meine App und - tja, die erkannte, dass ein neuer Tracker in der Nähe ist, aber - mein Handy hat leider nur Android 6.1. Und somit konnte ich den Tracker nicht installieren, nicht ausprobieren, denn der Tracker braucht mindestens Android OS 7,0. Tja, jetzt habe ich die Hardware, aber nicht die Software. Zu blöd, dass man das erst rausfindet, wenn man den Tracker zuhause hat. Also zur Warnung an alle: Erst mal checken, ob das Betriebssystem auf dem Handy passt. Wäre ja zu schön gewesen, wenn das schon vorher in der Werbung für den Charge 4 irgendwo gestanden hätte. Ach ja, und die Armbänder, die ich mir zum wechseln gekauft hatte, können natürlich auch nicht angebracht werden. Vielen Dank auch dafür.\n', '\n  Got this for fact was waterproof and had built in GPS.Initial set up frustrating appeared to be stuck on set up screen, but what I realised was to return to home screen, (watch face) you need to gently hold either side of the screen – this is also the key for everything else – if you are in one of the menus just hold both sides of the screen and you go back one level in the menu – finally getting back to the main screenEasy setup, multiple display options, easy to use, GPS appears to be as accurate as apps such as ‘Map My Walk’ using the phones GPSIf using the auto detect activity the GPS does not activate, (so if you want a map, which is why I got it), you do need to manually select the activity you are doingDisplay easy to read, depending on watch face and your eyesight, even in sunlight, rapid menus and intuitive once you get over the initial ‘how do I get back to the watch face’ GENTLY HOLD BOTH SIDES OF THE SCREEN.Battery after two days is down to 56%, but that is probably down to me playing with it constantly finding all the bits and pieces it can do.Overall delighted with it, (so much so just bought the wife one as well)Nice neat device, has extra apps, including the contactless payment which was a doddle to set up, that I may or may not use in the future but does everything I hoped and would recommendHave now had the charge 4 for a few weeks, still delighted with it, but have noticed a couple of things, if using the GPS for long periods (like a 4 hour walk), this does seem to drain the battery quickly and needs charging every couple of daysAlso a couple of times after starting the exercise going the tracking has switched off, but I think this was due to me having the strap too tight so when putting my hand into a press up position, I was touching both sides of the screen, and it was going back to main screen.\n', ""\n  I've been a Fitbit user for a number of years, originally having the Flex 2 and most recently the Charge 3.I found, as others had on the internet, that my Charge 3 was becoming increasingly frustrating and pretty useless when calculating my running and cycling distances. Growing ever frustrated, I switched to the Charge 4 on hearing Fitbit had introduced an in-built GPS, in the hope of having relatively accurate data.On these grounds, I am not disappointed. The GPS is really very good, particularly for what you pay. Having tested in on a number of different runs and cycles, predominately in woodland, I've found that it's very accurate (particularly in comparison to the Charge 3).I'm not so bothered about the Spotify or pay features (if you're UK-based), which I know others are grumbling about. In my opinion, if you want these sorts of features, you should look for a smartwatch. I find these sorts pretty gimmicky / useless if you're looking for a fitness tracker which isn't designed to be a smartwatch. I've also not had the technical issues which some seem to have.The battery is definitely nowhere near as good as the Charge 3. I suspect this is because of the GPS - which they DO advertise. I've noticed I'm having to plug in my Charge 4 twice at least twice as frequently as the Charge 3 (going for at least 3 runs and 2 cycles with GPS per week). This can be a little jarring if you're used to the battery of a Charge 3, but considering the size of the device with GPS running, I think people are being too harsh on the battery life.All-in-all, I'm pleased with the device. Fundamentally, it's not going to let you run or cycle for 4+ hours using GPS (particularly in GPS challenging scenarios). If this is a problem for you, look elsewhere, but be aware you're not going to find a device which is as slim and powerful. I'd recommend this device if you're looking for a slimline activity tracker which is GPS enabled, it reads your heart-rate, has a sleep-tracker and connects to a clever app. The price and quality seem to be near-unrivalled in the field, so I really do think there have been some overly strong criticisms of this device.\n"", ""\n  I bought my first FitBit and at first, the screen wouldn't respond so couldn't be connected. I left it for a day and hey presto, it came to life. However, the strap then broke and it fell off my wrist whilst cycling and was smashed.So, I order a new one and same again, the screen won't respond so can't be paired. Maybe I'll leave it another day again.Either way, they just haven't been tested properly and aren't robust if they won't stay on your wrist!\n""]"

When you wear the Versa 2, the weight is balanced enough that it doesn’t bring any discomfort, and light enough to sometimes forget you have it on.• The design is almost identical to an Apple Watch. With square rounded corners, it’s almost impossible to tell the difference if you had both of them side by side.• I had no discomfort wearing this Fitbit when I slept and had no itchy feeling around my skin when I woke up. Overall, you can wear this all day without any issues.• The screen has great contrast, vivid colors, and has excellent brightness. On a clear sunny day, I put this display to the test and it passed with flying color. Outstanding outdoor viewability.• The Alexa feature does work. I did like the fact that with you can speak to this watch as if it was a smartphone, and Alexa will answer to you (in text). Weather report, nearby stores, and overall a quick way to get an answer (More details later on).• Fitbit is pushing this Versa 2 into the world of smartwatches, as you’re able to control any of your smart home devices with this watch. I only have some smart light bulbs, so my testing was turning them on and off with this Fitbit. Please to say that it worked flawlessly.• I felt the sleep scoring system was pretty accurate. I tested it for almost a week and the graph displaying for my sleep fit my experience. Fitbit always does a great job providing your data in a visually appealing look on the app and in desktop form.• The alarm feature is very useful. When the Versa 2 is tracking your sleep, it will find the best time to wake you up before you “actually” have to wake up. Everyone has a different sleep cycle (light and deep sleepers) so you may expect a different outcome. Usually, it’s within the 30-minute time frame before your alarm is set.• The other fitness programs in the Fitbit (activity trackers, heart rate, distance travel, calories burned, and so forth) are all decently accurate and effective. This technology isn’t new, but Fitbit does make fitness trackers that are consumer-friendly. You’ll be surprised how complex some tracker out there are. If you had the previous Versa, you should expect the same layout.• Some features like the Relax app (guides you through breathing exercises), movement reminders (lets you know when you been sitting for too long) and step counts all stimulated me to be more active. It’s hard to explain but when you see your progress on a graph, or even a number, you feel compelled to keep growing it. Because of Fitbit’s friendly visual graphs, you don’t have to write anything and overall it brings a form of motivation to keep increasing your numbers.• Numerous exercise modes, training guides, and even 10-minute training cycles. Like I mention before, if you need something to motivate you to work out, this will be it.• One of the best features in the Always-On-Display. I’m a huge fan of this because you’re not wearing the watch every second of your life. It’s nice to see that you can leave it on a table and the display will still viewable, like any other watch.• Third-party apps like Uber are available for this watch. I don’t use Uber, but it’s good to know that third-party app companies are putting their foot in Fitbit.• Going for a jog, the watch vibrates when I get a notification, which is just a text for me. It’s also pretty straight forward in deciding what you want to be notified about.• Yes, you can swim with it. Haven’t tested this out though.• Battery life is good, compared to the other smartwatches out there. Around 3 days of use before I need to charge it. Maybe 2 if I’m using it a lot, and the Always-On-Display is on max brightness.Cons and Oks:__________• There is a connectivity issue that I’m dealing with my Versa. It would disconnect from my phone and would take numerous times in trying to reconnect it. I have no idea why it’s doing this  but I’ve noticed past reviews online addressing the same issue. It has to be a software problem because others are not getting this issue as well. Be on the lookout.• Another issue with the connectivity is you won’t know if there is no connection until you physically look at the display. This is a huge issue if you have notifications, texts, and updates coming from your phone to this watch. If the watch is disconnected, and your phone is not with you, you may miss some important stuff.• On the display, I felt Fitbit’s main icons are very unclear. What I liked about Android and Apple is that even if you never used there OS, you can tell where to go with the icons they provide you. The icons that Fitbit provide are very unclear and if you don’t use this device often you’re going to be lost in there OS.• You’re paying decent money for the device but Fitbit restricts a lot of it as they want you to sign up for their monthly “Premium” services. This monthly Fitbit service offers a great deal of programs, but if you don’t want to pay a monthly payment then you’re stuck with the “basic” software of the watch.• No idea why Fitbit did this but you can’t stream Spotify on this watch unless you have premium Spotify subscription. Not only that but you can’t even allow playback from this device to your speakers, phone, etc. I hope they fix this as it seems you need to pay more to use the watch fully.• Alexa provides the basics of communication but other than that I found it useless. The voice recognition lacks useful search results and since there are no built-in speakers, you’ll never get any audio notifications and hear Alexa’s answers. Middle of a workout, you will have to stop and look at the text that Alexa provides.• To even use Alexa, you need to install Amazon’s Alexa’s app on the phone and have an account with it.• No integration with Apple Health and Google fit. You have to stick with Fitbit all the way.• No GPS. You need to connect it to your phone to all GPS tracking. Without it, this creates a reduction in accuracy when you run. I didn’t find it to be that much off, but it’s enough that I think you should know.• Has some thick bezels around the screen.• If you want to change the strap, expect a fight. Fitbit locks the brands pretty solid, so taking them out ain't going to be fun.• I wish that you can customize the Always-on-display because currently, it’s a very simple layout. Not customizable to your choosing.• Currently I can’t respond to text messages with this watch with my iPhone, but you can use this feature on an Android.• I notice that Fitbit doesn’t have a payment system of their own. When you want to buy an app, you’re going to paying directly to the developer, where they can use any payment system they want. So far this isn’t an issue but it’s something to note in the long run due to security reasons.• You can’t even store your favorite apps for quick access.• Up 300 songs you can store on the desktop Fitbit app, but you have to transfer them over WIFI. No wire transfer and depending on your WIFI speed, it will take some time.• When you get a notification, or ask Alexa a question, you’re going to get a one-sentence answer. Numerous times I found this frustrating because you’re not getting any context to help you, and it just leads you to want more.• Your phone needs to be with you to fully use this watch. The Versa is an accessory to your phone.Bottom Line:__________It’s not a smartwatch for your phone. You have to get on board with this idea before you buy this watch. The point of Fitbit is to have a digital fitness book on you at all times. With the Versa 2, It’s a fitness book that does all the writing, tracking, and you’re only requirement is to workout. This is what Fitbit does a great job in. It provides you as much detail as you need on exercises, your workout routines, and your health. I felt the need to check on my stats every day as it’s one of the few devices that can visually show you that you’re improving. A light device, excellent display, and a great motivation tool.But you need to put it in your head, it’s not a smartwatch. The Apple Watch is a smartwatch. The Galaxy Watch is a smartwatch, and this isn’t. Unlike other smartwatches, once you buy this, you still need to pay more to have the full experience. Fitbit premium “monthly” services provide a great deal of data and programs to help you out, but you need to pay for it. Even with the payment you still need to have your phone around as Alexa currently isn’t useful enough other than asking for the weather. With no built-in GPS tracking, limited text/notification updates, and Spotify restriction, you can see why this isn’t in the same category with Apple and Samsung.This is a fitness tool to help you keep your body in shape. Fitbit does a great job in that, but if you’re looking for a smartwatch then go over to Apple and Samsung. Those are smartwatches, this isn’t.Overall: A virtual fitness book that is a must-have for those who want to get in shape but has too many issues to be called a real smartwatch.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer\n"", ""\n  The Versa 2 brings some modest improvements to the original, both inside and out. Here are some highlights:The screen is now AMOLED, yielding brighter colors and deeper blacks.The glass cover no longer has a bezel, giving it a smooth, low profile and premium look.The optical sensor on the bottom is bigger and doesn't protrude from the case, making it more comfortable on the wrist.The music and exercise buttons are gone. A mic to command Amazon Alexa is in their place. She can do things like set timers, alarms, reply to texts, give you the weather forecast as well as a FEW other useful things.The processor is faster. Apps load faster and the touch screen is more responsive.Always on display is now supported.Screen brightness is now always adaptive, though you can preset the base brightness.There is a new sleep mode which turns off autowake and notifications during during selected times so your watch doesn't bother you while you sleep. Do not disturb mode will silence calls and notifications during exercise as well.You can control the Spotify app on your phone from your watch.Fitbit pay is now standard on all Versa 2 editions.*The battery is rated for 5+ days. I've been getting a solid 6.5 with always connected, all day sync, 24 hour HR, and at least 3 hours of running.That being said, the Versa 2 isn't perfect. Fitbit OS is still feature lite, the app store is still rather small and there is still a dearth of useful clock faces. I'd still like to see a screen lock feature, a stride per minute counter and music controls in the exercise app, and a bunch of small. QoL improvements.If you're like me and mostly want an excellent fitness tracker with a handful of productivity features sprinkled on top, then the Versa 2 is for you, especially if you want a battery life long enough to make use of any of those things. If you care less about fitness and more about controlling your phone from your wrist, then you might want to look at a Galaxy Watch or a Fossil Gen 5, especially if you don't plan on tracking sleep, as you'll need to recharge both at the end of the day. If you have an iPhone I don't know why you're reading this.\n"", '\n  \xa0Another update before I return my watch for the second time: it’s 5:36am and my watch says that I slept 8 hours. I’ll upload the imagine. I went to bed at 11:15 and woke up at 5 am. I can’t believe how off the sleeping app is today.An update: my Sister got a new Fitbit versa for me again and I wore both Apple Watch and Fitbit Watch. The step count was very different. Almost 3 thousand more steps with the Fitbit. It counted extra 800 steps while I was in the resting position. Ones again I contacted the Fitbit asking them why this has happened, they told me Apple and other devices  count steps differently. 2856 step difference is huge though.My wife just got her Fitbit Versa 2 yesterday and went swimming with it as it today. The watch initially worked for a few minutes while using the swimming app. After 20 minutes she came out and the watch was totally off. We tried to charge it everything but it seams that it got water fried. It’s supposed to be water resistant up to 50 meters!  The pink band was bought separately. Original was purple. Had exactly same problem with last generation Versa. And from googling it seams that we are not alone with this problem. I returned my watch and asked Fitbit if they would give a discount if I buy a new watch they said they will not. Well I guess I’ll just save up extra and get an Apple Watch. Will definitely send all the videos I had made to the bloggers so others won’t make the same mistake.\n', ""\n  I have used Fitbits for many years - all the way back to the days of the first Fitbit Flex. I have upgraded over the years to the Charge, the Charge HR, Charge 2, and now the Versa I and finally the II.LOOKSFitbit Versa 2 is significantly better looking than the Fitbit Versa 1. The screen has less bezel, and doesn't have that ugly Fitbit logo at the bottom. Even if the screen size isn't a massive increase, it feels as if it is because of the rounded glass. This gives it a much more premium feel. The screen is also now a AMOLED display which means it will provide an ample amount of brightness and great sharp colours in the great outdoors (compared to the LED model of Versa 1).BUTTONSIf you were a fan of the three button system the old Versa has, then look away. Now you have to rely more on the swipes and taps on the bigger screen to navigate. I rather like this more polished look as it becomes sleeker in my view but not everyone may have this opinion.OSThe OS has some new tweaks like a dashboard which enables you to set night mode, do not disturb, brightness and whether you have a screen that wakes on movement or manually. This is quick useful as in the past it took a few more taps and was more clumsy of a process. Overall i have found over the years the Fitbit sleep tracking and exercise tracking to be fun to use and best in class compared to other trackers. The new sleep score system puts all the information together to give you a singular number to compare you sleep on a daily basis.SPEEDThe Fitbit Versa 2 is much snappier thanks to the upgraded internals. Whilst scrolling through, you can tell the touch response to the screen is much quicker than the prior generation.COMPATIBILITYThe Fitbit Versa 2 has a new charger hub, which means you can't use the old Versa 1 charging cable. Fitbit loves making new products that aren't compatible with old chargers. Whilst this is disappointing, at least the Versa 1 straps are backward compatible with Versa 2. So at least you have that. The watch faces are also compatible vs the older Versa, so there is already a massive existing library for you to customise your experience.NEW FEATURESThere aren't really that many new features compared to the Fitbit Versa 1. The main addition worth mentioning is really just Alexa capabilities. Unfortunately i found out that you need to keep the Fitbit app open in the background. It seems to have no problem picking up what I am saying. I have found Alexa to be a bit of a gimmick as the connection is not always reliable. It often tells me that there is no internet connection or the app isn't open and therefore Alexa doesn't work.BATTERY LIFEAccording to the specifications the battery life is supposed to last 5 days. This is 1 more than the old model. After a year with the old Versa, it seemed to decrease in battery life, but this is expected with older devices. I will update in this review once I can put it to the full test. However, Fitbit over the years has lived up to the specifications on every device i have owned (except of course if it is defective). I would expect it to last the full 5 days as advertised. This is far longer than many of Fitbits competitors out there.SHOULD YOU GET IT?If you already own a Versa, and it still works fine, then no - probably not. But if you have a defective or bashed up old on, then you might consider the upgrade. I think given the unreliability of Alexa and connectivity being required to access these smart features, it loses 2 stars for me. However, this is hopefully a software update away from being far far better. I will update this review should anything change.If you are a newbie to Fitbit, then I do think this is a good starter to get into the Smartwatch/fitness watch game. It is less smart than some of the competitors out there like Apple Watch and even the Garmins, but it does what it says on the tin, is reliable and at the end of the day a household name ecosystem that many of your friends will be part of.UPDATE: After 6 days of using, the battery is still at 32%. Fitbit has outdone themselves with the battery life. The connectivity problems with Alexa are still intermittent, but i have found it to be slightly more reliable than when i started. I also found the resting heart rate sensor to be quite different from the Versa 1. I will continue to monitor, as it hasn't changed as much as it usually does in a 1 week period with my Versa 1.\n"", '\n  Es gibt wenig Dinge, die so einfach sind, wie diese Uhr zu installieren und mit dem Handy zu verbinden. Wenn man sich an die Gebrauchsanweisung hält... Wer denkt ""Gebrauchsanweisungen sind für Verlierer!""... Viel Glück. Das kann dauern.Wenn man sich jedoch schön gewissenhaft an die Schritt-für-Schritt Anleitung hält, kann nichts schief gehen. Okay - man sollte das Passwort für sein heimisches Wlan parat haben. Und das für sein Spotify Konto, wenn man Spotify auf der Uhr nutzen möchte. Ich mochte das und das Koppeln war wieder absolut (!) simpel. Ich kann sämtliche Alexa Geräte ansteuern, oder mir aussuchen, auf welchem Gerät Musik hören will. Alles problemlos.Weil ich gerade bei Alexa bin... Ich habe mehrere Male versucht, die Beleuchtung in meiner Wohnung (Hue Birnen) und Wlan Steckdosen von unterwegs aus zu schalten. Und es hat jedes (!) Mal funktioniert. Einwandfrei und zuverlässig. Auch das Smartlock zu bedienen - mit der Vesta 2 keine Probleme. Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass man aus Neugierde und Vorfreude den einen oder anderen Schritt überspringt oder was nicht richtig einstellt. Und das es dann deswegen Probleme gibt. Die Uhr ist einwandfrei und funktioniert wie eine 1!Thema Armband. Da hat jemand geschrieben, dass ihn das Montieren des Srmbandes in den Wahnsinn getrieben hätte und man dafür gute Nerven bräuchte. Na ja, ich hab\' mich auch hier genau an die Anweisung gehalten, das Armband im spitzen Winkel anzusetzen bevor ich den ""Riegel"" zuschiebe und - es hat funktioniert. Ich denke tatsächlich, dass die meisten ""Das funktioniert gar nicht!!!"" Kommentare nur daher kommen, dass sich Leute die Gebrauchsanweisung schenken und dann komplett im Wald landen. Natürlich ist dann die Uhr daran schuld...Ich bin total begeistert und würde die Uhr sofort wieder kaufen! Meinerseits eine Empfehlung für jeden, der sich nur eine Uhr kaufen will, aber es gut findet, jeden Tag auf ein anderes Zifferblatt zu sehen. Ob die Uhr lebensnotwendig ist...? Mit Sicherheit nicht. Aber sie macht unglaublich Spaß 👍🏻 Und wer ohnehin ein klein wenig technikbegeistert ist, wird die Uhr lieben!p.s.Wer sich über den silbernen Rand des Gehäuses wundern sollte - ich habe mir gleich von Anfang an ein Cover für das Gehäuse zugelegt. Genau genommen zwei. Eines mit schwarzem und eines mit silbernem Rand._____________________________________________________________________________________Nachtrag am 18. Januar 2020 - von 5 auf 2 Sterne reduziert.Die Uhr war wirklich klasse. Bis gestern. Denn es geht nichts mehr. Zumindest mit der App. Der App, die unbedingt nötig ist, um die Uhr funktionieren zu lassen. Und dazu der armseligste Support aller Zeiten. Der Reihe nach...Es ging damit los, dass sich die Wlan Einstellungen in der App nicht mehr öffnen liessen. Ich dachte zuerst an einen Fehler, den man durch Neustart beheben könnte. Neustart der App und auch Neustart des Handys. Keine Veränderung. Jetzt wird\'s aber erst richtig interessant! Ich bekam über die App eine Email, in der mir gesagt wurde, dass der Akku Ladestand niedrig sei und ich die Uhr laden solle. Kein Problem - der Akku hält sehr lange. Uhr geladen, alles bestens.Nur liess sich die Uhr ab jetzt nicht mehr mit der App synchronisieren. Ich hatte den FitBit Support angeschrieben. Dort wurde ich auf die Hilfe Seiten verwiesen. Okay. Uhr ausschalten, wieder einschalten. Bluetooth Verbindung trennen und wieder verbinden. App deinstallieren, Uhr ausschalten, App neu installieren, Uhr einschalten u.s.w.  Resultat: Nichts. Nur eine Fehlermeldung, dass die Synchronisierung nicht erfolgen kann. Warum? Das wird leider nicht gesagt. Dann die Lösung aller Probleme: Die Uhr vom FitBit Konto abmelden, die App deinstallieren, App wieder laden, installieren und dann die Uhr wieder anmelden. Klingt nachvollziehbar. Aber jetzt... Die App geöffnet, in meinem Benutzerkonto angemeldet - alles in Ordnung. Jetzt die Taste "" +Neues Gerät anmelden"" gedrückt. Dann kommt eine Auswahl, in der man das Modell anwählen soll, das man eben anmelden möchte. In meinem Fall Versa 2. Dann gelangt man auf ein blaues Feld, in dem unten steht: Einrichten. Da drauf geklickt und - das war\'s. Sackgasse. Nur noch eine Fehlermeldung (siehe Bild). Und damit endet der Versuch, die Uhr in der zugehörigen App anzumelden. Keine Synchronisation mehr, keine Wlan Einstellungen, kein gar nichts.Und zum Schluß die Kirsche auf der Sahne... Der Support von FitBit teilte mir mit, dass das Problem wohl bekannt sei - dass das schon einigen Nutzern so ergangen sei, aber dass man im Moment leider nicht helfen könne. Und man hat sich im Voraus sehr freundlich für meine Geduld bedankt. Ich habe jetzt also eine Uhr, die perfekt funktioniert hat, bis die App von einen auf den anderen Tag einen Bug produziert der alles (!) stoppt und der Support mir höflich erklärt, dass man da wohl nichts machen kann.Ich habe also über 180.- Euro für eine Uhr bezahlt, die wegen eines bekannten (!) Softwareproblems einfach nicht mehr benutzbar ist. Die Foren, die sich mit Smartwatches befassen, haben beängstigend viele Einträge von Usern, die ebenfalls Probleme mit der Software haben. Wenn die Uhr mit der App funktioniert, ist sie erstklassig. Aber wenn die Software so voller Bugs und Fehlern ist, dass die Uhr plötzlich nur noch eine nette Dekoration am Handgelenk wird, ist das nicht gut. Und auch nicht fair gegenüber den Kunden, denen hier offensichtlich übereilt etwas angeboten wurde, das noch nicht durchentwickelt war. Die Uhr geht zurück, vielen Dank...\n', '\n  Ich habe die Fitbit Versa (1) vor der Versa 2 besessen und kann daher die Geräte relativ gut miteinander vergleiche. Daher werde ich mich bei dieser Bewertung primär auf die Unterschiede konzentrieren.Positive Veränderung:- Display ist jetzt AMOLED statt LCD (Dadurch sehen die dunklen Menüs weniger grau und mehr schwarz aus)- Es gibt einen Always-On Modus (Das Display zeigt die ganze Zeit monochrom die Uhrzeit, die Akkuanzeige, das Datum und 2 weitere Werte an, die in den Einstellungen gewählt werden können)- Die Uhr reagiert schneller und das ganze UI wirkt flüssiger- Die Akkulaufzeit soll sich verbessert haben (Ich habe das Gerät noch nicht lange genug um das zu bewerten)- Es gibt ein Mikrofon (Sinnvoll für diktierte Antworten auf Nachrichten und Alexa Steuerung)- Die Standard Variante besitzt NFC (Beim Vorgänger brauchte man die Special Edition, um Fitbit Pay nutzen zu können)- Sie bewertet den Schlaf (Je nachdem wie gut und wie lange man geschlafen hat, bekommt man für die Nacht eine Bewertung, die von 0 bis 100 geht)Neutrale Änderungen:- Es gibt statt 3 Tasten nur noch eine (Ich persönliche habe die beiden rechten Tasten beim Vorgänger nie verwendet wodurch ich die Änderung befürworte)- Das Gehäuse wurde größer (Dadurch ist es nicht möglich Schutzglas, Hüllen oder Ladeadapter vom Vorgänger zu verwenden)Negative Änderungen:- Der Ladeadapter ist katastrophal (Beim Vorgänger ging an der Seite des Ladeadapters das USB-Kabel zum Aufladen raus, wodurch es möglich war die Uhr hinzulegen. Also genauso wie bei der Apple Watch zum Beispiel. Bei dem neuen Adapter geht das Kabel unten raus, wodurch ein hinlegen nicht ohne weiteres möglich ist, ohne die Uhr auf die Seite zu legen. Und nach meiner Recherche passt der alte Adapter wohl nicht auf das neue Modell. Sonst hätte ich schon längst so einen nachgekauft)Im Großen und Ganzen kann ich die Uhr empfehlen.Ich habe mir die Uhr geholt um eine Smartwatch zu haben, die mir meine Benachrichtigungen anzeigt, ein paar Apps bietet, mit der ich bezahlen kann, die mir sagt wenn ich mich zu wenig bewege, meine Tages- und Schlafaktivitäten aufzeichnet und bewertet und die ich nicht jede Nacht aufladen muss. Mit Always-On Display hält der Akku (je nach Nutzung) ca. 4 Tage. Bei Deaktivierung dieser Funktion hält die Uhr bei mir eine Woche.Wenn jemand genau nach solchen Sachen sucht, ist er mit der Fitbit Versa 2 gut bedient.Ich muss der Uhr aber leider trotzdem für den Ladeadapter einen Stern abziehen. Aber auch nur, weil er ohne Grund schlechter wurde als beim Vorgänger. Ich kann nicht begreifen, wie man auf so eine Idee kommen kann...\n', ""\n  Pre-ordered this and delivery was on time.In the box you get the watch, charger, and some straps. There's also an instruction pamphlet, but it's pretty basic. To get started properly you need to download the Fitbit app, after which the app will take you through the installation process. Be warned that there will most likely be a firmware update to go through first, so you need to have the Fitbit on charge.So the charging cable is a custom USB cable purely for the Fitbit. An industry standard cable would have been better - just one less cable to manage.The watch is easy to use. I suggest buying a custom clock face (you can do this via the app. The custom clock faces provide a lot more info). There's a lot of customisation you can do. I have the display set to off, and the watch will switch on the display if you make the action with your wrist to look at the watch (not 100% perfect though).Battery life looks to be very good. I've used the watch extensively for a 24 hour period so far, and the battery is at 84%.Edit: the battery life is awesome. I charge it once a week, even then I reckon I could get a couple more days out of the existing charge.The biggest negative for me is that the watch can sense when your exercising and start to log the activity. Only problem is that is works for some exercise types only e.g. it didn't work for when I did weight training. You do have the option to manually add the activity, or start it via the watch, but given the price of this watch it should log automatically.The other issue I found is with the app. Some clock faces require an activation code. This can only be done via clock face settings in the app, which isn't yet supported for the Versa 2. Edit: this is now fixed.Another issue I found with the app is that it doesn't log a walk properly when using GPS. I stress this is an issue with the app and not watch. What happens is the app starts to log, and then at some random point stops logging using GPS, but still provides the correct statistics, only that according to the GPS part of the stats the walk ended long before it did.I'll update this review as I delve more into the features of this watch.Edit: The watch records your sleeping heart rate, but Fitbit charge a premium for you to see YOUR data. Not impressed. That's one star knocked off\n"", ""\n  It states you can download music onto watch and play from watch, however doesn't mention the additional £9.99 month for the app to do this. Also to track the sleep mode to track sleep disorders isn't in UK yet but will charge for this service when it is. I have had FitBits for some years now but will be moving to another watch.\n""]"

And it does that in my sleep.-So the way to fix this is to wear it higher on my wrist/forearm... but that’s not as comfortable.-I’ve only had it for a day and I want to try it out for at least a week... but that’s just a dumb feature. I’d rather just tap the top to turn it on than press the sides. Who came up with that?- I don’t like that I run for 30 minutes but it changes it to a higher number because “active zone” or whatever gives you 2x the minutes. If I run for 30 minutes... I run for 30 minutes! It says I exercised for 99 minutes... but I only did 69 minutes. It gave me 2x the minutes. That’s just dumb and confusing.- I also don’t like that I can’t zoom in on my sleeping log and see the graph.Update: I’m returning it\n', '\n  I purchased this Inspire 2 as in upgrade to my old Alta HR. I liked the Alta HR because it had a slim profile and was simple to use. The Inspire 2 has two flaws that are deal breakers for me. 1: you cannot change the “apps” that display on the face - so if someone was looking at my Fitbit they could see my weight. I am a teacher, my students play with my Fitbit at times and I don’t need them to know that personal information. 2: Whenever my wrist and arm touch together, it makes my Fitbit vibrate. I have worn it for not even an hour and had to take it off because it was annoying.I spend nearly 1/2 an hour on the phone with Fitbit customer service for them to go through their whole speech, to find out these a “features” that can’t be removed.\n', '\n  My four year old Charge 2 HR battery was getting weak so I decide to buy a new Inspire 2 and I’m glad I did.First of all, it does everything and more than what my Charge 2 HR did for me, which was quite a lot.  Without taking advantage of the free Premium offer, all the data presentation I enjoyed with the older Charge 2 HR is included in Inspire 2.  Plus improvements in looks, screen brightness, a much longer battery life and a link to my phone GPS for improved tracking of my long walks.The negative reviews I’ve read revolve mostly around the irritation of the vibration notifications.  To preempt those problems I immediately turned off almost all of the notifications.  Do you really need your watch tell you your phone is ringing?  Or you can’t remember that you’ve been sitting in your chair for the last hour?The setup was super easy.  From your current app account, add a device and make sure it synchs to your new Inspire 2 so all of the data stored in your old Fitbit ports into you new device.  I just let the battery run out on my old Fitbit and will soon delete it from my account.For only $99 this is a great device.\n', ""\n  I have the Alta HR and the face is pretty scratched.  I have short arms so all the Fitbits are too large.  I was so excited when this came in yesterday and it is about the same size as my Alta.  But then every time I bent my wrist and it had skin to skin contact it immediately vibrated.  There are no buttons just to turn it on, you just finger touch both sides.  Obviously you flex your wrist all day.  All of those vibrations every 2 minutes or sooner is a hard fail and there isn't a touch sensitivity that you can play with.  My other problem is that it didn't give me the reminders to move, even though I had it turned on.  So it's being returned and back to my scratched Alta :-(\n"", ""\n  I was so excited to get my new, upgraded Inspire 2 after my original HR crashed. I can't get passed the super annoying constant vibration or buzzing every time I move my wrist. Like others said, sometimes it puts the unit into some tracking mode, which makes my results inaccurate. I researched it and even called Fitbit customer service to see if there's a way to turn it off. No go, unfortunately. Everything else is great, but I just can't deal with the annoyance. I'm going to return it and get the original Inspire again.\n"", '\n  I have worn an Alta for almost 4 years but the battery was going bad. I like the fact that the Inspire 2 is sleeker and lighter than the Alta. However, I hate the fact that every time I move my rust it vibrates and lights up DND (do not disturb). I don’t care that my DND is off or on. I could go into my account to deal with that on the very rare occasion it needs to be changed.\n', ""\n  Most features work fine but the sleep monitoring feature does not.  The instructions tell you that it should begin measuring sleep automatically, but that feature only works when you have been completely still for one hour.  I am a fairly restless sleeper so this threshold for starting the sleep monitoring doesn't work for me.  It is possible to manually start the sleep monitor on the Fitbit app.  If you choose that option the instructions say that you won't get information on sleep stages, and that does seem to be the case.  However, I used the manual start option one night and that is the only time I have seen the sleep stage data.  Again, the threshold for getting sleep stage data is to have 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep (no restless moments, or awake moments).  That is fairly rare for me.  There are specific instructions on where to place the Fitbit when sleeping, but mine just moves down my wrist as I sleep, so that doesn't help.I think Fitbit should be more transparent when advertising the features of the Inspire 2.  Also, my interactions with customer service via the chat feature on the website were less than helpful.\n"", '\n  Very disappointed. Have the Alta hr and love its design but just shake your arm and get all your steps in. I was hoping the inspire 2 would not do that but it does. Waste of money. Will be returning.\n', ""\n  My last Fitbit was the original Flex model, which lasted a good few years.  I wanted something with a decent battery life, there's not much point having one of these devices if it spends an hour a day in a charging dock (like my Smart Watch, which doesn't really cut it as a fitness/sleep tracker)I saw that this model also had HR tracking, so I thought that would also be worth having - what I didn't realise was that the HR tracking is _continual_ - it's always tracking, which given the long battery life, I find incredible.I was slightly concerned about the lack of a physical button (the older Inspire model had a clicky/tactile button), but the one onboard the Inspire 2 is just as functional, it has haptic feedback so you can feel when you've pressed it and it's just as functional as the older style button.The touch screen is very responsive and glides through the various displays with ease, but ultimately a device like this is for data gathering, any number crunching will be done on a phone/laptop, but the relevant real-time data points are all there (current HR, steps for day, active minutes, calories burnt and so on)The wristband is basic but very comfy (and more importantly, stable - it doesn't slide/roll around the wrist), my initial thoughts were to replace the strap with something else, but after a few days of wearing it, I've realised that's it's just about right.The included (year long) FitBit premium is a nice touch, I'm not sure how much benefit I'll get from this over and above the standard FitBit plan, but time will tell. Some of the premium features seem to include longer-term data analysis, so maybe this will prove useful. But I've set myself a reminder to cancel the automatic payment continuation next year, just in case I'm not using it.Overall very pleased, the unit is put together really well and they've clearly honed the design over many years/iterations, it seamlessly integrates with your phone's app and was a breeze to setup.\n"", '\n  Just spent 2 hours onto Fitbit helpdesk, as the fitbit is not getting notifications from my iPhone HR. It is running IOS 14.0.1. I was told after a lot of messing around that there is a problem with Fitbit getting notifications from IOS 13.4 and above. They had no answer to when this will be resolved!!!!! Beware\n', ""\n  I'm a bit surprised to read reviews on here saying that it's stopped working or doesn't sync...or doesn't work with iOS 14.I've only had my Inspire 2 for a few days of course but so far everything works exactly as it should - even with iOS 14. The sync takes about 3 seconds every time and I've had no instances of the FitBit refusing to do anything.You speak as you find so I can say...the Inspire 2 works perfectly and does everything I want it to!\n"", '\n  I was looking randomly for a fitness tracker but not at a huge price. I saw the Inspire 2 was about to launch.  The price was decent and covered everything like heart rate, sleep, calorie burning etc.  I\'ve used it it at the gym and whilst out walking and found it really great for tracking my heart rate and calorie burn!I really loved the battery life, went well beyond its 10 days most times, and the app provided some really insightful data.  However things started to go downhill after using this for a couple of months.  Firstly I had to contact support via live chat because I was not getting any notifications from my phone, and after about 2 hours of really ridiculous and tiresome troubleshooting, the support rep tells me ""actually we know this is a known issue, check back on our website for updates on future fixes.""  Slightly miffed but I carried on happily using it for fitness tracking data.Move on to December (less than 3 months after receiving the item), the watch stopped synching to the phone app. I left it hoping/thinking it would rectify itself.  Wary about having to go through hours of troubleshooting again, I eventually had no choice but to contact live chat again. Their stupid chat system disconnects if you move your mouse outside of the chat window or if you move to another tab - never seen the likes of it. So I had to start from scratch with 3 different support reps.  After multiple switch off/ons, delete and reinstall the app, nothing was working. We went through about 5 thousand steps and I hoped that something would work. 3 hours later, i am finally told that two devices that we used to install the app were in fact not compatible!!!As you can imagine, i asked why did my supposedly incompatible phone work fine for 3 months and then decide not to??  They really didn\'t give a hoot, and said it was out of their control.  I then had to ask why they don\'t actually advise customers in advance that a majority of devices are not supported - again they didn\'t answer.In desperation, i logged into amazon to see what my returns option was - thankfully the support person was there to.... well support me. Unlike fitbit support, who give you the generic BS and don\'t really care, Amazon really came good and arranged a return for me.  Since my experience it seems I am not alone when it comes to many of the features not actually working for purchasers of the Inspire 2, so I am a short lived customer never to purchase from them again.\n', ""\n  i've owned pedometers before and i track my steps accurately on my phone, however i had been recommended fitbit so i thought i would give the new inspire 2 a try.the fitbit inaccurately records steps. i can clock up 1000 steps by driving for an hour with the fitbit on my wrist.when i take it off my wrist and put it in my pocket it is more accurate ,however, doing this makes the HR feature completely useless ?whats the point of having a step counter if its so inaccurate.**editing this review as the fitbit has grown on me as i gave it chance.. its still pretty useless as a accurate step counter ,but everything it else it says that it does it does well .

I got this smart watch as a much cheaper alternative, and I'm very happy with it so far.First impression:This watch looks a lot like an Apple Watch which, in my opinion, is a good thing. It's very lightweight, smooth, and comfortable to wear. Previous to getting this, I had a larger Fitbit that was uncomfortable to wear, so I ended up not using it after a while. I haven't worn a watch in some time, but it's been very easy to get used to wearing this one. I've been wearing it for a couple of weeks, and I actually forget that I have it on most of the time.Pros:— Touch screen is very responsive and accurate. The gestures (swipe, tap) are intuitive and easy to learn.— Battery life is EXCELLENT. I wore this for almost a week on one charge.— The charger is easy to use and fast. I like the way the charger magnetically sticks to the watch.— Watch notifications work well with Apple iPhone 11. I have the watch set to notify me when I have calls and texts, and this is very helpful when my phone isn’t right next to me.— The VeryFitPro app syncs with Apple Health to record steps, sleep, etc.— Step counter seems pretty good—at least close enough for someone just wanting to make sure I’m up on my feet throughout the day.— While the watch doesn’t have a lot of options for the face styles, I like the default one a lot!— The comfort of this watch really does deserve a second mention. It is very comfortable to wear.Cons:— Notifications on watch (for calls and text messages) aren’t aesthetically pleasing; they look a bit like old DOS command lines. However, they are absolutely functional, so this doesn’t bother me too much.— The VeryFitPro app can be a little confusing because of translation issues. This app is obviously made by non-native English speakers. If you know what you’re looking for and what to expect from settings in a smart watch, it’s easy to overlook the clumsy English, but the language could trip up some users.Conclusion:This watch has very pleasantly surprised me. I would rate this a 4.5/5 (I don't give 5 star ratings unless there are no cons to a product). I think it’s a great affordable option for someone who wants a smart watch but can’t afford an Apple Watch or even a FitBit. Not a lot of money for A LOT of functionality. Highly recommend!UPDATE: I still think it's a good watch, but I'm not sure that the step tracking is completely accurate. I've actually gone back to using my old Fitbit because I needed something that would track accurately and integrate well with another app that I'm using.\n"", '\n  this watch is great for the price! i am picky so i did a lot of research before buying this one and i’m pretty happy with it. i got the pink one. i’m going to list the pros and cons and then my overall opinion at the end.PROS:• love the design, it looks as pretty as it does online!• batter lasts forEVER and it’s waterproof!• it fits really well! i have really small wrists so i was worried that the end would hang off and look bulky but it looks perfectly fine with the little slider thing that holds it in place!• i love that it has the veryfitpro app to sync it with• it’s super comfortable and light which is so nice, and it doesn’t look awkward! i’ve seen some fitbits look awkward like it doesn’t conform to their wrists or looks bulky but this watch looks great on!• great features: heart rate, steps, sleep cycle, alarm, notifications from phone (only from limited apps though, unless there’s a way to change that. if so, let me know!), sports feature that tracks your sports activities, relax function, music controller, timer, activity reminders (vibrates to remind you to stay active!)• as far as notifications go, you can view your text messages, emails, instagram notifications, and a few other apps, they will go straight to your watch and vibrate lightly and quietly when they come in. calls also come through on the watch but you cannot answer, you can only view and decline if you want. you also cannot respond to any messages, you can only view them.CONS:• the interface isn’t perfectly flawless and smooth. idk how to explain it but i’ll try... on an iphone when you scroll, it’s pretty seamless and smooth, like there’s no glitching or lagging. but with this watch there is a SLIGHT (and i do mean VERY  slight) lag when you’re scrolling around on it. of course, this isn’t an apple watch or anything and it doesn’t really bother me but it’s worth noting in my opinion.• there is no mic so you can’t talk to it at all• can’t respond to messages or answer phone calls (you can decline calls though)• not all your social media app notifications can come through. i got my instagram and twitter hooked up but there is no option for snapchat, and i use snapchat the most! so keep in mind you may not be able to get all notifications from all apps on this watch.• there are only 4 face dials! and there’s only 1 that’s pretty decent in my opinion. the original (the one in the picture) is the best one. there’s another digital one that pictures a pixel-y reindeer in the night sky (kinda weird and random) and there’s an analog one that has white numbers in an “alice-in-wonderland” type of font, which i don’t really like either. the last one is the prettiest, it’s an analog and has a simple pink flower (looks most like an apple watch face). but no numbers which i don’t like. it would be nice to at least be able to change the color.• i heard in other reviews that the pink band gets dirty and stained easily so i will keep you updated on that.OVERALL:overall it’s a pretty great, simple, high-quality watch for the price! it looks just as good as online, fits perfectly, not bulky, works well if you want something simple, go with this watch! i’m happy i went with it! i’ll be doing an update in a month or so to see how it holds up and how everything working. thanks for reading and i hope this helps!\n', '\n  Fun checking out what your body is doing. How many steps I do a day is fun to see. What your heart is doing is fun too. This works great fits wonderful. Does all the things I wanted it to do.\n', ""\n  Short initial review, I will update my review after wearing it for a period of time!-Watch seems to be surprisingly good quality and fit.- App and initial set up was very easy- Actually shows phone notifications vs other cheaper models where they do not.-Sleep tracking-Not bulky and has good size incrementsI've only had it for a few short days, but initial thoughts lead me to believe that this will be a good alternative to pricey name brand models! I will update after a few weeks.\n"", '\n  Love my new watch. It does it all. This smart watch is great for any fitness person or someone to just wants a good quality watch that does all the advanced features. Does sleep tracking which is one reason why I purchased this in the first place. I swear I did not get a good nights sleep and if I do sleep it’s not all at once. This contract my sleep patterns. It comes with a mobile app. Easy to use. Holds a long battery life. Excellent value. Good quality. We make a great gift. It will fit any man’s rest were women’s. It has an adjustable wrist band with  one size fits all\n', '\n  Ótimo custo/benefício! Bateria dura muito! Simples de usar, atende aos usos que eu estava procurando sem precisar gastar muito com outros modelos. Me atende bem. A entrega foi rápida.\n', '\n  So far so good. Sleeping and heart rate seems pretty close if not perfect.  Good value for money. Overall 100% satisfied. In fact I will buy another one for my friend.\n', '\n  good value for the price, but low scroll screen, not really smooth, overall not too bad.\n', '\n  O relógio funciona muito bem.

The band feels soft and it and the screen are both thin. I don't really like anything on my wrists so I don't wear bracelets and haven't worn a watch in years, but after a couple of days of wearing this I was used.I was happy at the fact that my heart rate, walking, running, biking and steps were all going to be kept track of along with a few other features. I was amazed when I found out all of the things that it actually does.Once you download the Very Fit Pro app that goes with it, there are so many other things you can do and even more activities that you can keep track of data for. (yoga, football, fitness, dancing, etc.)My favorite is the sleep data. It's broken down into 3 categories and tell me how many hours and minutes I do of each. There's Deep sleep, light sleep and my awake hours. Now when my Dr. asks me if I think my sleeping medicines working I can tell her if I'm actually getting any REM sleep and show her the chart.This fitness tracker itself totally helps me to stay motivated. One thing I like to do is compete with myself by trying\xa0to take more steps than I did the day before. Yes I'm a dork, but it's fun.A few other things it does is vibrate when I have a call or text and it works with both my iPhone 8 and my Alcatel Android. Easy pairing, quick charge and long lasting battery. Excellent price!!\n"", '\n  My fitbit malfunctioned and was out of warranty so I needed another tracker.  This one had good ratings and had what I wanted (it actually has more features that I currently use!).  If you want a fancy tons of bells and whistles that is like an apple watch, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for something comparable to a $100 dollar fitness tracker, you will be HAPPY!  I mainly use this for time (it is a watch afterall!)  and to track my steps.  I think it is actually more accurate the my previous more expensive device.  I also LOVE the fact that the time display is larger (since I use reading glasses) and the display is easier to read in daylight compared to the more expensive tracker.  The heartrate feature takes a few seconds before a heartrate is displayed (compared to the instant display on a fitbit) but that is the only ""issue"" I have found .  The heartrate also appears to be very accurate.  The features I have not yet used are connected to the app.  The watch will alert you to phone calls and text messages. It will also track your exercise (bike, walk, run) and your sleep..  I have not enabled these features yet.  For more petite women, you may want to purchase a smaller wrist band (I am using the very first hole on the band)I have had the watch about a month and so far have been very pleased!  It charges well (and more easily than the more expensive tracker). From my experience, it also holds a charge for a bit longer ( a little over a week).  For people like me who do not need tons of fancy stuff but appreciate a reliable product, this is the perfect watch!\n', '\n  Three weeks in.. functioning perfectly. Easy to use.. why spend all the $$ on a smart-watch or name brand fitness watch when you can get this item. It does all I need it to do.... notify me when  message comes in, tell time, and track my steps and sleep.  Easy to use interface on my phone.\n', '\n  I bought the black Letscom tracker after my Fitbit Zip died and I found out they no longer manufacture them. Not gonna lie, I would have bought another Zip if I found it used for about $20, but the Zips on eBay were selling for around $50, which is much more than I\'m willing to pay for a used, outdated fitness tracker.Anyway, after researching different options I settled on the Letscom tracker. I liked that it was only $30 which is big for me because I don\'t have lots of disposable income to throw around.Although I\'m not a big fan of the ""watch"" aspect, I\'m getting used to wearing one again. I would much prefer if they had a way to clip it to your belt, but I can\'t seem to find a clip accessory. Hopefully they\'ll offer it in the future.Honestly, I only bought this thing for it\'s step tracking abilities. There are a bunch of other features that I basically ignore. I\'ve tested ""run mode"" and ""bike mode"" and they work just fine but I never use them. Who knows? Maybe I\'ll change my mind someday. I guess it\'s good that I have the option.Things I like about this tracker:* It\'s super accurate when counting steps. I figured I was wasting my money on this tracker buying from a relatively unknown company. I\'m happy to admit that I was wrong. It does a great job accurately counting steps.* I appreciate that it\'s waterproof up to a point. They say don\'t wear it in the shower or swimming pool and I don\'t. But I\'m glad that I can still wear it while washing my hands. I have a weak bladder and pee a lot throughout the day. It\'s much easier being able to wash my hands while wearing the watch instead of having to take it off 7-10 times a day whenever I use the rest room.* It was easy to connect to the app on my phone. Sometimes pairing Bluetooth devices to your phone can be a downright pain the neck. This paired on the first try and hasn\'t needed to be re-paired once since I\'ve been using it for more than a month now. My Bluetooth scale needs to get paired again at least 3 times a week, which is super annoying. So kudos for making an easy device that actually works!* The watch is thin and not too bulky or heavy. I don\'t like wearing watches. I have no problem admitting it. And it took some getting used to with this watch. But because it\'s thin and light, it didn\'t take too long to feel normal. I\'d still prefer a belt clip, but this is okay since I have no other choice.* It\'s pretty easy to charge. I know it says it will last a week. Mine doesn\'t go quite as long. I usually have to charge it every 3 days which isn\'t too bad. Pulling off the watch band and plugging it in to a USB port is really easy. And it charges in less than an hour, which is great.That\'s about all I have to say about the Letscom watch fitness tracker. This review went a lot longer than I anticipated.All in all, this is a good tracker that I\'m glad I bought. I miss the online community aspect with Fitbit, so maybe they\'ll create one in the future. Besides that, if you want an inexpensive, accurate, easy to use step counter and fitness tracker this is a great option. I highly recommend it.\n', '\n  Love this. Works well and super easy to set up, best $30 I spent. Its pretty awesome/ and does more than I expected.  It even has a wake up alarm clock\n', '\n  I love this product so much. I bought a second one for my mom. It isnt ultra hi tech but it does everything you need to. It counts steps, heart rate etc. It tells the time and can also link to your phone for calls and texts.I bought this to see if I would use it and if I could justify paying for an apple watch. I also convinced two of my co workers to buy them too! You only need to charge it every 5 days or so and when it does need to be charged it charges in about 30 mins.The customer support is also awesome. Two of the bands broke and they replaced them immediately for me.\n', '\n  Bien\n', '\n  Me gusto pero no me acomodo muy bien con su pantalla es algo rara\n', '\n  El software es muy pobre en comparación con Fitbit.\n', '\n  Item arrived 2 days late but soooo very worth the wait. Sooooooo happy!!!!!\n']"
