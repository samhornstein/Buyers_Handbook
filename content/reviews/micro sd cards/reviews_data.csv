That weird scam seems to have mostly cleared up these days, but you never really know.  The Fake Micro SD card scam was wide-spread and brutal when it happened.  The news media eventually had to report on it.  Not just vlogs and stuff; this scam made Evening News headlines, like the big three Network News...if you know what I mean.So there is reason to be wary of these purchases online.

Thank God I was allowed to return it\n', '\n  For all the reviews saying the size isn\'t right (and thinking that means the cards are fake) you are not reading the description and you don\'t understand how hard drives, SSDs, flash drives, or memory cards are sold. This is an industry standard. Your computer reads things in multiples of 1,024... so 1,024 bytes is a KB, 1,024 KB is a MB... 1,204 MB is a GB, etc... But all drives are sold in multiples of 1,000. So if you buy a 512GB card, and do the math... device makers are saying that card is 512,000,000,000 bytes. But divide that by 1,024 and your operating system will see it as 476.84GB. Beyond that, you also lose a small percentage for the ""file system"" index on the drive. So you may see a few GB less even. In my case, I have a 256GB card, which shows up as 238GB, which is exactly as expected. The description on this listing explains this with the text:1MB=1,000,000 bytes. 1GB=1,000,000,000 bytes. 1TB=1,000,000,000,000 bytes. Actual user storage less.That explained, I tested my card\'s speed to see if it hits the 120MB/s ideal... not really. But marketing hype being what it is, I\'m sure the ""Speed up to 120/MB/s**"" is in perfectly ideal conditions with specific readers and file sizes and the like... so my test of 93MB/s on a 10 year old USB 3 card reader with the SD adapter is acceptable to me.

They are reliable and they live up to the speed and capacity classifications they claim to. I\'ve been using Samsung cards for years and they are the only brand that consistently doesn\'t give me any issues year after year.This 32GB card is no exception. However, by default the card is formatted as FAT32, but I prefer exFAT as FAT32 won\'t allow you to transfer a folder containing more than 4GB to the card. That\'s annoying if you are moving data from an old card to a new one. FAT32 has 4GB file size limitations, but on a transfer it recognizes a directory containing lots of files as 1 thing, and applies the 4GB limit. This will give you an error (in Windows anyway) that there isn\'t enough space available for the transfer. But if you copy the files individually it works fine. Or just format the card to exFAT and it will accept the folder that exceeds 4GB easily. exFAT will work just fine in an Android phone as well (Android 5.1 or higher. Earlier versions may have some issues with the exFAT formatting)This card handles full HD Video at 60FPS without faulting. It\'s write speeds are fine to use for HD video.But be sure to authenticate the card upon arrival to make sure it\'s a genuine Samsung card with the stated capacity. Micro SD cards are a favorite thing for fraudsters to counterfeit because it\'s cheap and easy to do it. In the past the regular Evo line of Samsung cards (the white and orange colored ones) where the popular cards to counterfeit. Though with these higher grade cards (Evo Select line with the white and green color scheme) starting to be more popular......well it behooves anyone buying a new SD card to check it\'s authenticity upon arrival. The 2 tone fade of the green coloring adds an additional anti-counterfeiting measure over the previous solid colors. This makes it more expensive to counterfeit a Samsung card convincingly.What happens is that fraudulent card makers will take a 4GB Class 1 card that costs $1 to make, and hack the control chip that tells the computer what the capacity of the card is so your computer thinks it\'s a much larger card. Your computer will even try to write well over 4GB of data, but the data doesn\'t actually go anywhere. It\'s the same idea as putting a 100 gallon label on a 10 gallon bucket. You can pour 100 gallons into it, but 90 of those gallons are just going to flow out over the top and be lost forever.Below are some steps to help you ensure that you get a legitimate Samsung card.❖ For the last several years Samsung has made it\'s micro SD cards with white plastic. That means the actual card itself behind the colorful label on front is white. You can see the white plastic on the sides. Fake cards are almost always all black, because they are generically produced low cost cards that are given a fancy Samsung looking label on the front. If the card you get it black ON THE SIDES, it\'s not a Samsung. White plastic is more expensive to make, and fraudsters are all about doing it cheap. (See my images below of a real Samsung card with the white sides and back showing) The back should be black. The sides should be white. And the front should be colorful with the 2 tone green fade.❖ Buy only from reputable vendors. Amazon is a reliable vendor. And if there is a problem, they will take it back without hassle. There are dozens of other 3rd party vendors who are just as trustworthy. But make sure you are buying from one of those. Read their seller feedback. If there are numerous complaints from people who bought fake capacity cards or even cards that didn\'t work properly, find a different seller.❖ Make sure the listing looks right. This one is fine. It\'s a legitimate Samsung card. (I\'ve personally bought it and tested it) But scammers will post nearly identical looking listings on Amazon that have cards that look nearly identical buy don\'t have the Samsung logo at the top. (Recently another scammer replaced Samsung with Sanshen on fake cards. Other than that they were identical. They used the same font any everything, including the A in Samsung that doesn\'t have the bar in the middle)❖ Be careful of the price. If the price of the card you are looking at is significantly below the price of other listings for similar capacity cards, something is wrong. One of the biggest tricks scammers play is to make the price WAY lower than it should be in hopes of getting you to spend more time looking at the price tag than looking at the other things that don\'t add up right on the listing. Unusually low priced flash storage almost never works out well.❖ Test the card once you buy it! Regardless of who you buy your Micro SD card from or what brand it is, test it out. A thorough way to test it is with a utility app called ""h2testw"". You can download it free. Just do a search for it on any search engine and you\'ll find it. That app writes single bit data to the drive until it\'s full, then it reads that data back to make sure it\'s readable. It will tell you what the actual capacity of this disk is. The default language on that utility is German, but you can switch to English easily. It is not fast. It will take about 45 minutes to test a 32GB card, and several hours to test a 256GB card. Just run it overnight and check the results in the morning. This is smart to do even if you have no doubts that you have an authentic Samsung (or other brand name) product. Sometimes things go wrong in manufacturing and quality control and a dud gets through. An app like h2testw will verify that your legitimate brand name card is working properly. And if it\'s not, you\'ll know right away while you are still in your 30 day exchange window.\n', '\n  Another user review points out that their 128GB Samsung EVO Select card is only rated for 60MB/s write speeds.If you look under the ""From the manufacturer"" part of the product description with the 64GB version of the card selected you will see that it states that it is rated for write speeds up to 20MB/s.The 128GB shows write speeds of up to 60MB/s.And both the 256GB and 512GB versions show write speeds of up to 90MB/s. All of the cards have a read speed of up to 100MB/s.Just wanted to point this out for clarification. I am not a fan of the way Amazon groups the reviews of multiple versions of the same product into one big confusing mess but it\'s the world we live in I guess.All in all it\'s a great card and exactly what I expected!\n', ""\n  I bought this Micro SD card to put in my Nintendo Switch.

En mi caso el paquete llego bien (honestamente es un paquete que vas a romper, por lo que no importa mucho), puede que en el transporte se doble un poco, puesto que lo mandan en sobres.Puedes grabar videos en Full HD y 4K sin ningún problema, lee hasta 95MB/s y escribe hasta 20MB/s. Con esta tasa puedes transferir un video de 3GB a tu computadora en solo 38 segundos.Algo que no mencionan tampoco aquí pero si en el sitio de Samsung, es que estas tarjetas son a prueba de agua, para ser compatible con teléfonos que también lo sean, o en caso de que tuvieras un accidente (como no suelen pasar).Esta tarjeta tiene la siguiente capacidad de almacenamiento:1 hora y 30 minutos de video 4K UHD.4 horas de video Full HD.7,500 fotos en Full HD.3,000 canciones.Ademas de ser ampliamente compatible, por lo que la compra es muy recomendada.\n', '\n  Si tu como yo estas indeciso por una micro SD para ru nintendo switch, te digo que Samsung es sin duda la mejor opción, clase 10 U3 que llego perfectamente empaquetado tanto el envio como el empaque d ela tarjeta\n']"

The same 2 cards also experienced intermittent read/write errors with my laptop. All were properly formatted. I've had a 3-pack of the Kexin 32gb cards work flawlessly in my cameras and laptop. Returning these and buying another Kexin 3-pack. I've had good luck in the past with PNY RAM, but it appears their storage devices leave plenty to be desired.\n"", ""\n  Plugged it in and it said it's only 462GB.Not 512. I tried reformatting and erasing any possible thing I could, but it was brand new and it doesnt have the space advertised. I could understand if it was 510 or even 500, but I ordered it because I need at least 480GB\n"", ""\n  I grabbed the PNY 16GB Elite Class 10 U1 microSDHC Flash Memory Card 2-Pack last August so I could use it with my 3D printer. I only used one of the two since I didn't need the second one at the moment, but the other day it finally died on me. Since the 3D printer isn't doing a ton of read/writing to the microSD card I expected it to at least last year.It is permanently in read only and you can't format it or do anything with it besides open files that are already on it. Thankfully I have the 2nd one for now, but I don't expect that one to last that long either. I would get it replaced via warranty, but since the consumer has to pay for all shipping I don't see a point in it. This isn't the first PNY microSD that I have had die on me, so I am going to just avoid these at all costs moving forward. I would avoid PNY microSD cards if they can't even handle very minimal read/writes and I would definitely not trust one of these in a dashcam or anything that holds important images or files.\n"", '\n  Unformatted capacity is 499 GB which formats to only 464 GB under Windows. True 512 GB should format to 476 GB. While not a huge problem, factor that in when deciding which brand has best price per GB. I returned mine since the description is not accurate and purchased Samsung EVO which I confirmed is a full 512 GB capacity.\n', ""\n  I purchased two of the 128GB cards from Amazon Services. The first died almost instantly so I returned it pending replacement. However just moments ago, the second one died too. Can't read the card in my tablet or my android phone. I intended to use one card for each. The first replacement is still on the way and hasn't even arrived yet. So I've reluctantly gone ahead and requested for a refund for this second broken card, and I'm betting that if I'd replace the second- that too would fail; looks like they'll both be returned & refunded. Weird because I have never known any SD card to fail. I don't think it's the real McCoy.\n"", ""\n  I bought 2 packs of two per pack.  The first three formatted correctly and were immediately installed and they worked just fine. The fourth sd card would not format. You might say that 3 out of four working  might be somewhere between a a three or four star review.  Not in this case.  When I, as a customer, have do do the quality control that the manufacturer obviously did not do, it gets a Zero in my book. Since Zero's are not used by Amazon, it can only earn a one star rating in this review.\n"", '\n  It definitely has good full HD 1080p video quality/transfer rate. Read and Write speeds are decent.

Buy this memory you wont be disappointed.\n', '\n  ordered the two pack of 16gb mSD. arrived quickly and passed the H2test to validate the size. That\'s great - these are NOT fake - they are exactly the right size and speed, as advertised. supposed to be ""up to 85 Mb/s"" - i measured write speed as 22.8 Mb/s, read of 84.1 Mb/s, making these some of the faster mSD cards in my rather large collection (used for raspberry pi). these are the ones you want.\n', ""\n  Quite pleased at finding this 32Gb SDHC at such a low price point. Proper official packaging so this looks the real deal.Tested by me with H2TESTW, and passes with flying colours.A good SD card, and worth a look at.Edit: I've been so impressed with the PNY Elite 32Gb SDHC model that I've ordered the 64Gb and 256Gb SDXC higher capacity cards.I've had a chance to use these now, and both SDXC cards I've tried deliver the same excellent performance I have become used to with the 32Gb SDHC model of this brand. I can highly recommend these from everyday regular usage on a variety of device platforms.\n"", '\n  Excellent value for a 32gb memory card. Well presented and in official sealed packaging.I only buy my memory cards from Amazon as there are so many fake ones elsewhere.
