Every time there is something good out there, these big corporations that don't care about the consumers can't keep their hands off good competitors, they have to buy them off, what a shame, no need to say any more. I have cancelled all my subscriptions to GOL and will start doing research for a conscience supplier.\n"", '\n  The reason for this review is the new packaging.The new packaging says ""new and improved with 30% more protein"". But when I compared the nutrition information with the old packaging, this is what I saw:Old packaging \\ new packagingTotal weight: 622 g \\ 568 gProtein per serving: 17g \\ 22gServing size 1 scoop: 22g \\ 28gServing size per container: 28 \\ 20Price: $28.21 \\ $31.68 (Jan 2016 \\ July 2016)I am giving 4 stars because I don\'t have any complaints about the powder quality. But trust is an extremely important factor for something that goes into my body. The claims in the new packaging makes me question that. The new bottle is taller than the older one, but it is only half full. Scoop is bigger as well. New packaging has less powder for higher price. New one has some extra ingredients though.Ingredients (Old):a. Organic raw sprout blend:Organic sprouted brown rice protein, organic amaranth sprout, organic quinoa sprout, organic millet sprout, organic buckwheat sprout, organic garbanzo bean sprout, organic lentil sprout, organic adzuki bean sprout, organic flax seed sprout, organic sun flower seed sprout, organic pumpkin seed sprout, organic chia seed sprout, organic sesame seed sproutb.

Mixed tocopherols:Alpha-tocotrienol, beta-tocotrienol, gamma-tocotrienol, delta-tocotrienol, beta-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherolIngredients (New):a.

I have never written a review, until now.  I am so disgusted with Garden of Life and their ""updated"" product.  It comes in a larger tub.  It has a larger scoop.  There is bold print everywhere on how it has 22 grams of protein per serving.  Yet when I stopped to analyze their newest iteration of their protein product, I realized I am getting MUCH LESS.  The tub, although being much larger than the previous version comes brand new, HALF EMPTY.The NEW and IMPROVED version has only 20 SERVINGS total per tub.  The old had about a months supply - 28 servings.So to break it down New vs Old:New tub = 568g of total product; 28g serving size; 22g protein (78% protein)Old tub = 622g of total product; 22g serving size; 17g protein (77% protein)In reality we are ending up with just a very slight increase in the amount of protein per scoop, yet 8 servings less and in that ridiculous LARGER tub.The new tub is LARGER in size yet contains LESS.  That was just wasteful, possibly designed to deceive the consumer - all from a company that states it wants to do the best for the world.  How about start by being honest and simply maintain what you had going while improving the contents.  If you reduce the amount of product - then REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE TUB!Lastly, regarding the servings.  28 servings in the old tub and 20 in the new.  I will have to purchase the NEW product over 18 times in one year period if I\'m taking one serving per day.  The old tub would have to be bought about 13 times.I am a college student without much extra money who tries to eat healthy. I always sit in the front of the class and even if I\'m not the brightest student I do know that money doesn\'t grow on trees.  I have learned however after this product, money is growing VERY well in the Garden of Life.\n', ""\n  Ok, steer away from this new version!! I've been using the old version for around 3-4 years and it was awesome. This new one is absolutely horrible ... the new creamy version they tout is more like sludge in your cup and the taste it not good ...! Did they even taste this to the public before they decided to change the whole formulate on their own. NEVER buying again. Why did you screw up a good thing??? should have kept it the same.\n"", '\n  Missing the true value of raw protein without the sodium. I have a low tolerance to sodium and the rebrand just totally destroyed my routine. Sodium is a preservative. Bring back the sunshine!\n', '\n  I have been using this product for years and loved it. The new formula is gloppy and tastes horrible. And while the price remains the same, you receive 2 ounces less, a larger container filled with mostly empty space, and a claim saying ""30% more protein"" - the more protein is because the scoop is larger (28 g vs the former 22 g). I am VERY disappointed as I now have to find a new protein powder - not an easy task when you have celiac disease and a milk allergy.\n', '\n  DO NOT like the ""new & improved!""  I think the product itself is still a quality product, but the flavor is...more than disappointing.  It may be \'smoother\' but compared to the previous product, well there is no comparison.  And I bought two!  Unhappily choking it down :(\n', ""\n  Firstly, the nutrition packed into this is spot on. The taste is also great too, although if you're used to those horrible fake tasting protein drinks, this one doesn't taste like that, it's more natural so therefore not to everyones liking. So why the 1 star rating?... I've been purchasing this regularly, now all of a sudden the price has doubled! Doubled!? I don't mind paying a bit extra for a quality product but going from £24.99 to £49.99 is pure greed and therefore I will stop purchasing this product, what a shame.\n"", '\n  Nice stuff however they are starting to get a bit greedy the price has jumped up over the past few months around  £20 more now than it once was for the same amount of powder. Think I will be giving it a miss this time.Edit: a month after I wrote the review above the price has gone up once again. Save your money.\n', '\n  Price is going up excessively month by month, product quality good however only lasts around 3 weeks with one protein shake a day.Went up from £26 to £45!! And you only receive half a tub. Shocking!!\n', '\n  Absolutely love this protein powder, haven’t found one like it. Have been purchasing it for over 10 months now and the price has gone from 20 to 50!!!!!!! Won’t be purchasing again\n', ""\n  My favourite protein powder I have tried thus far. My tummy does not tolerate most grains and legumes prepared by conventional means whatsoever, they have to be sprouted or fermented and I don't always have the time/preparation skills to sprout things and fermented products like tempeh are too expensive to eat enough of everyday. This is just such an easy way to get a big dose of protein in my breakfast/lunch that doesn't hurt my insides, make me massively bloated or gassy. Keeps me full (sometimes even too full!), super satisfied and provides me with a LOT of energy.PSBest smoothie/milkshake ever = banana, half an avocado, 1 tbsp nut butter, 1 tbsp maca, 1 tbsp raw cacao, 1/2 - 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 scoop of this protein powder and as much almond milk as you needed to get your prefered consistency.\n""]"

It tastes like brownie batter!!I have tried nearly every kind of big brand protein powder and have never liked a single one. Either they are sickeningly sweet or have a terrible aftertaste- or both. This is the only protein powder that has such a delicious balanced taste, and I tend to not like sweet or flavored protein powders at all! I look forward to drinking this before and after my workouts and absolutely love that it is plant-based.Some people have said they do not like the texture. It is not as smooth as some other shakes, but I wouldn't describe it as grainy and I think the thicker texture is enjoyable.Overall this tastes great mixed with any kind of milk that has no added sugar- almond, rice, oat milk, you name it.I will never switch powders!\n"", '\n  For one, I never write reviews... so this must mean something .This is the best protein powder I have ever bought. Period... I’ve told like 12 friends about it. it tastes great and it comes in the biggest container. I use it every single day to make my meal replacement smoothie. Also, I have a dairy allergy and previously purchased a powder that said “dairy free” on the label but was a total lie and a waste of my money... so I was skeptical about all the others. Will keep purchasing!!!! Also has anyone bought anything else from this company that they would recommend?\n', '\n  I have tried soooooo many brands of powders. As you know it’s subjective which is why the market is saturated. I’ll hit the key points... not chalky. The scoop is a reasonable size so you’re not eating two giant scoops of powder. I’ve bought grainy thick powders and then on top of that you need Iike 3 giant scoops. Gross. This powder just looked yummy from the second I opened it. It wasn’t dusty or like a pale brown. Rich. There are so many vitamins too. Read the label. There is 50% of the rec daily value of A,D B6 and C! I won’t list it all but also included are digestive enzymes . You can even bake with it. I blend with part of a frozen banana, ice and water. I also add a little cacao and flax seed in addition to what is already in there. May not be necessary. I purchased this brand due to reviews. Convenience. Price. And because it is VEGAN, organic, gluten free, non-gmo, and made in the USA. Protein powders are definitely a personal preference but give it a try! Eat more plants for beautiful skin, a healthy body, a cleaner planet and a clean conscience !\n', '\n  Ok - so about me: I’ve tried sooooo many protein powders... basic whey isolates, whey blends, casein, egg, some plant based, all brands - (I used to work at GNC so I’ve definitely tried a wide gamut of flavors and brands there’s some gems and some complete trash)... I have never tried a plant based protein and “liked” it. It’s sometimes tolerable but I’ld never spend a penny of my own money on it, or it tastes like I’m chewing dirt.I was drawn in by the reviews on Kos and had to find out! I mixed with~8-10 oz of water and just shook it (no little blender ball/jack, just shake) and it was just as good as many whey powders!!! (I say that way because I’ve never tried a powder that didn’t taste like a powder/protein drink, so no, it’s no “chocolate milk” but it’s a very good protein chocolate drink). No strong orders, blends well, easy to drink. Lots of people say it’s too sweet, but I think for a chocolate protein drink it’s great! Very happy I tried this! So for any whey people looking for an alternative, I think this one is pretty darn good!\n', ""\n  My initial reaction upon receiving the product is that\xa0it's a pretty big container! 30 servings, at 2 scoops per serving. 2 scoops seemed like a lot to me, I've been using 1-1.5 scoops in a glass of water and that's been great, I could see it easily lasting two to three months depending on my frequency of use. I've included a photo against a water bottle for size comparison. I really love that it's 100% organic and vegan –\xa0it's really important for me to know that what I'm putting into my body is super healthy and also has minimal impact on the environment. Pea-based proteins are the way of the future and it's awesome to start seeing products using this ingredient. I've included a picture of the ingredients list and supplement facts. I was surprised there is only 6g of fat per serving, and as I said before the servings are pretty big. There are a ton of essential vitamins and nutrients which is a big plus so I can start my day energized and in the right mindset. So far I've been using it as a breakfast supplement but I could easily see myself using this to replenish after a workout. As someone who is a bit lactose intolerant, the fact that you don't need to mix it into milk is also great.The taste is awesome! This is a make it or break it for me, even powders that are super healthy I won't use if I can't stand the taste. I ordered the chocolate version (again, super surprised that there are only 2 g of sugar for something chocolate flavored!) and it's pretty good! It's almost creamy which is interesting since it is a vegan product. Cold, it tastes similar to a melted chocolate milkshake. I am definitely impressed. They also have a vanilla flavor, I am not sure if I will try it or whether I will stick to the chocolate for future purchases. Since it tastes so good, I am planning to use it in baking recipes for an extra boost. The drink itself makes me feel full and energized so I'm sure incorporated into cookies or breads would be a satisfying, healthy snack.Please note that I received this product at no cost in exchange for an honest review.\n""]"

I read through a couple of the reviews stating that this contains high amounts of heavy metals, and I would just like to say they are outdated with their claims.The Garden of Life brand was tested by an independent lab in 2014, and they found their products contained elevated amounts of heavy metals, most likely due to the brown rice protein they use. Garden of Life responded and CHANGED THEIR METHODS. They have a self-imposed regulation of heavy metals for their  products now (the USDA does not have any limit or regulation on heavy metals in food) and these are their limits :Lead limit: 250 ppbTungsten limit: 50 ppbCadmium limit: 1000 ppbMercury limit: 50 ppbEverything has some sort of heavy metal in it. Everything. These limits are phenomenal, and you can go to their website and see their recent heavy metal tests on their products.So people, stop fear mongering. This is a great product, and an excellent company.\n', '\n  I took my time to review this product due to a lot of negative reviews about heavy metals and ingredients.I typically try to lean toward products that are organic and clean products and narrowed it down to a few - GOL being one of them. A LOT of people talk about heavy metals in this product, others say the ingredients have changed. I read a lot before purchasing this, because like you did not want to spend this kind of money on a product that is going to backlash and do more harm than good.From my own credible research, I discovered products that are plant based can contain heavy metals.  Metals are found in the earth where vegetables are grown, so this is something that you cannot completely avoid. Luckily, GOL provides info online of all the heavy metals that are in fact in their product today. They even go to the land sites where their produce is grown and test the soil... pretty impressive! If interested just search this through the web. I also learned that in low amounts our bodies can absorb some of these.... like mercury. I read that mercury can be absorbed through fibrous foods.A breakdown of how I rate this product:* Taste and texture. Taste is decent. I bought the chocolate and it tastes like a lot of powders I have bought in the past. The texture is kind of chalky. I believe this is due to the greens in the powder. I have ordered several plant based protein powders in the past and all resemble this texture. Especially the greens alone. Make a smoothie to get past this!* Organic Flavor Blend - This is the only thing on the ingredient list that I do not like. It uses Flavors which contain chemical based product. These are not listed, just says Chocolate or Vanilla Flavor.* It claims to be a meal replacement... Well this is not a true meal replacement b/c its only 120 calories. A true meal replacement product should be at least 400 calories.* Pricey! But will pay for a good healthy product. No issues with digestion.* Mixes well with water and/or milk. I use a shaker bottle and this works easily and no clumps.I personally think this is a good product. GOL did rebuild their label by renaming it, and may have updated their ingredients... I know they had cases of salmonella poisoning years ago. I do not see any reason to not buy this again. Seems legit and honest.***I hope this helps you. Im an honest Amazon Customer, not one paid or sponsored. Click helpful if you did find this helpful.***\n', ""\n  First I do not usually write reviews although I'm taking the time to maybe try to help someone else decide if they would want to spend the money and try this.  Do it... what would it hurt? In January, after turning 41, I decided it was time get healthier as it seemed each year I have been gaining about 10lbs per year and lacked energy.  I have a sore foot so running or walking was not an option. So I decided if I can't exercise I would try to start eating healthier. After watching fruits and veggies go bad in the fridge, I starting looking at easier ways to get that stuff in my body. Fast forward 10  months ahead, which is today, I have taken this in substitute of my breakfast  every day.  I am 34 lbs lighter and a lot  more energy. I really believe my body was lacking all the nutrients it needed to perform everyday life. All the good stuff I'm putting in my body with just 1 glass far exceeds what I could cook in the kitchen. The  night before I mix 1 scoop of the vanilla blend w water in a mason jar. In the  morning I pull it out of fridge,  shake up good, and drink on my way to work. I was not looking to lose weight by drinking this, I was looking at putting nutrition back in my life, but how can a woman in her 40s comp,ham about weight loss!!\n"", ""\n  So I was looking which other flavor to buy because the last couple times I have been buying the chocolate flavor but the stevia is way too strong for me and I have to put lots of frozen fruit to kill the sweetness. So I was reading the comments and someone already noticed that they use pea protein as their number 1 ingredient now. So I am not sure what that really means besides that is cheaper for them to make it and gain higher profits. But I decided to compare the new label with the old one. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES. A LOT OF THE VITAMINS ARE LOWER PERCENTAGE THAN BEFORE.Attached is a picture of the old formula where pea protein is not among the substances.Here some of the differences to make it easier for you. Just to be clear I am comparing the one scoop servings!  OLD:  NEW:VITAMIN A:  20%  10%IRON:  15%  10%CALCIUM:  5%  4%BIOTIN:  15%  10%MAGNESIUM:  20%  6%ZINC:  35%  15%SELENIUM:  50%  30%MANGANESE:  80%  15%CHROMIUM:  70%  60%MOLYBDENUM: 80%  50%As you can see everything is down and some with big margins. I purposely gave one star to their product now so I can attract attention to this and hopefully Garden of Life will give logical explanation why they decided to change the formula.The other thing that bothers me (but it is not only them but probably the low allows it) is that you see all those fancy ingredients but you don't know what percentage of the total are they. So the pea protein could be 90% of the whole powder and the expensive ingredients 0.05% for instance. I think the customer should have the right to know that information so he can make informed choices. Anyway for now I am not buying a new box until I hear from Garden of Life.\n"", ""\n  Yummy, and extremely easy to digest... The ingredients are incredible....HOWEVER, this used to be around £35 ! This is a £20 price increase. This coincides with the company's acquisition by Nestle, who are obviously on a mission to price healthy foods out of existence. Nestle is a terrible company and this is very sad.\n"", ""\n  My husband and I both love it. We were taking Shakeology but ran out so we ordered Raw Organic Meal Replacement in Chocolate. It's so good! It tastes amazing with frozen bananas and peanut-butter and some almond milk. That's my husband's favourite recipe. I like to add cold coffee and almond milk for my morning pick-me-up. I also ordered the Vanilla Protein and it's very versatile. I like both and will probably order again. Shipping was fast and the containers came sealed and listed all the ingredients on the back. The label looks nice too. I like the product very much.\n"", ""\n  When I bought the previous version of this product it did not have added sugar.  Now it has been reformulated as 'Lightly Sweet' and has cane sugar added - which it does not need.  If someone wants it sweeter, they could add their own choice of sugar/sweetener.  Now I will have to look elsewhere for a different product with similar ingredients and no added sugar.  I have been told the company has been taken over by Nestle.  Has doubled in price, too.\n"", ""\n  I'm very pleased with this purchase. It's a bit thicker in consistency than I expected, but it's really nice!  I was expecting it to taste worse than it does, so I made the error of mixing it with fresh fruit juice. It was way too sweet.  I mixed it with soya milk next but it was too thick.  Finally, I mixed it with water and it was a better consistency and it tasted good too.I wanted something warm to eat when I came home late and had this in a bowl with warm milk, water and honey (no real need for the honey actually).  It made a great porridge.  I was careful not to make it too hot as I didn't want to damage the enzymes in the raw meal.The ingredients are of the highest quality, I feel very full after having this and it exceeds the 30g of protein I want for my breakfast each morning.  It ticks all the boxes, so I'm buying another one just to keep at the office.\n"", ""\n  Ok so I read a lot of reviews on this product and decided to try it anyway. I was looking for a meal replacement as I am trying to lose baby weight - this flavour is not bad and it doesn't taste as chalky or as disgusting as some people have made out but it smells bad to me so I hold my nose and just down it - that works for me!I have been using it for a week now, I have not lost any weight, it doesn't keep me as full as I hoped it would (but I exercise 5-6 times a week) I am not hungry for about 2 hours and then I need to eat. It's full of good stuff so will finish it but not sure I'd buy another one.Only given 3 stars as it doesn't keep me full and it smells bad.\n""]"

I kept hearing about this powdered collagen and decided to do my research ( it took me 3 months), to become an informed participant.  I do not consume any medicine, synthetic or herbal supplements. I first looked at large bodies of evidenced based research to support why I should consider consuming this product.  I found tons and decided to give it a try.  First, I bought the single serve and shook it up in a 16oz water bottle, then prayed I would not throw up.  Barely and I mean barely any taste whatsoever. Moved on to purchasing a single serve blender---poured 200 ml of organic  milk, a splash of carnation milk, 1tspn organic agave, 1tspn organic cocoa powder, 1 scoop collagen powder and 1 scoop maca powder..AGAIN you can't even taste the powder and no after taste.  Results...joint pain gone! Hair growth 1 inch in 1 month, nails are stronger (I like short natural nails), skin--bye bye fine lines and fine wrinkles (the ones you see in the 5x magnifying mirror).  For the sake of clarity, my goal was to address some joint pain. The ancillary advantages/outcomes was not what I was seeking--but I am not complaining.  I make the shake everyday and drink it after my Pilates and elliptical workout in the am.  Oh yes, for us women of a certain age...pre, during or post menopausal, it reduced the flame on and in the heat of the night episodes by 90% --get your sleep back.  I am a former ballet dancer and while I am in good health and maintain an uncompromising size 6, I know I was taking my health for granted.  Thinking that I could still hitch my wagon to the good genes shooting star. Well all good things come to an end and I really should have been taking supplements all along.  Joint pain is reduced by 70% and I'm very pleased.  I am not a physician and just sharing my personal results/observations (unintended and intended). I'm still pretty shocked at the results, as I had no expectations of a positive or negative outcome whatsover. Please do your research!\n"", ""\n  I have been very happy with this product - the first difference I felt after a few weeks was that it helped me sleep. It contains glycine and if you look online there is research that shows that helps with sleep. I sleep for longer periods and if I wake up at night I can fall back to sleep quickly which has made a big difference in my general well being.  Then after about six weeks my knees started to feel better which I think was the collagen, and now after a few months my hair is more shiny - all good things!It does have a taste - it isn't strong but I tried it with plain water and it needs some flavor to cover the taste. I don't want to add it to my coffee, and like drinking it cold. I found that flavored carbonated water like LaCroix is just enough to cover the taste, but it does not dissolve quickly in cold liquid. I was mixing it and leaving it sit on the counter until the lumps were gone, which could take as long as an hour. Some of the photos I have seen in the comments show lumps and I think they didn't let it sit long enough to dissolve.I finally came up with a method  to mix it quickly and I wanted to share it. What works for me is: (1) Pour a small amount of the cold flavored water into a glass - maybe 2 oz. (2) Put that in the microwave and heat it until it is hot - about 20 - 30 seconds. (3) Sprinkle two scoops of the Vital Proteins into the small amount of hot liquid and stir it until it dissolves. It will dissolve quickly without lumps when it is hot. (4) Pour in the rest of the cold flavored water in the glass with the already dissolved collagen solution and mix that. If I want it colder I put in an ice cube. This would work for any cold liquid, you could add juice as well. Basically, the idea is to dissolve the Vital Proteins in a small amount of hot liquid first and then add the cold liquid to that solution. Hope this is helpful!\n"", '\n  LOVE THIS STUFF!! I have NEVER tried a product that gave me so many benefits! Lets start with my nails. They are as hard as acrylic. My nails never grow and I hate taking pills like biotin. With this powder, I pour it in a half a bottle of water FAITHFULLY every morning. Consistency is the key! I can\'t speak on my hair bc I keep it braided under my wigs. My joints, A GOD SEND!! I normally go to the chiropractor at least once a month and sometimes a whole week if I lifted weights too hard at the gym to get adjustments in my lower back. I also usually have knee pain when I do my squats. After about a week of taking this every morning, I haven\'t been to the chiropractor in 3 months! My back doesn\'t bother me. My knees don\'t hurt after workouts. I have gotten A LOT of compliments on my skin! I noticed I don\'t have those ""pockets"" around my eyes in the mornings like I used to. IT WORKS PEOPLE!\n', ""\n  This is the weirdest thing since I started using this powder and it's only been a week. My skin feels amazing. . On the days I use it I see the effect within hours. I didn't think it was this product at first so I tried to skip it just to test it out and my skin feels back to its dull self\n"", '\n  The first order I got of this was 10oz in a white lid tub. That stuff dissolved great and easily in anything. My second order came 10oz in a blue lid tub and it\'s a lot clumpier and will absolutely not dissolve in anything but hot liquids. Luckily I put it in my cofffee so it\'s not a huge deal, but the differences are a bit concerning. After a month, my nails are definitely stronger but that\'s it. Going to keep on but might get a new brand next time. Batches shouldn\'t be different like I\'ve experienced, even if it\'s a ""natural product"".Update: I picked up a 20oz from Whole Foods to see if it would be better than the amazon batch and it still doesn’t dissolve in room temp liquids. However, I can honestly say my nails are like rocks and my boyfriend keeps saying how soft my skin is. I also make sure to take a multi vitamin at least every other day to keep up my vitamin C for collagen synthesis. Still concerned about batch differences but these peptides are doing something for sure! Curious to see progress with skin after 6 months.  May or may not stick with this brand.\n', ""\n  I can’t review how this works as I've just received it and used it only once. It dissolved very well in my hot cup of tea.I do have a problem with the received product though. One main reason i purchased this particular brand was that it was also supposed to contain VITAMIN C and HYALURONIC ACID -(helps absorption) according to advertised picture. The product I received doesn’t contain any of it. It might be older version of the product but they shouldn’t advertise it with these extra ingredients if they don’t deliver it.\n"", ""\n  Just another product that doesn't do anything - I'm just eating normal food none of this stuff which you don't actually know what the ingredients actually are!\n"", '\n  Not a problem nutritionally, but a very expensive brand\n', ""\n  I've only just started using this product so can't say if its going to help. I purchased it to help with joints and skin. It says its un flavoured but I mixed it with water and it does have a taste. It doesn't mix well in cold liquids so I prefer to mix with hot juice.\n"", '\n  good product bad packaging\n']"

In my eyes it has always been the industry standard. Good ingredients, great taste, no BS.I received my last 5lb tub of Vanilla creme yesterday and made a shake. It was absolutely disgusting. The shake was so sweet I gagged but reluctantly finished it. This was at night. The morning after I had diarrhea. Browsing through the comments it seems other people are having the same experience too.Surely this is due to the recent change to the formula where they added sucralose, an artifical sweetener.I'm now stuck with 5lb of inedible powder and left with the task of finding a new company to purchase my protein powder from.Well done, ON.Oh, and thanks for the diarrhea.\n"", ""\n  Best protein on the market. For everyone saying the formula has changed... as far as the Double Rich Chocolate I've been getting for YEARS, there is no change as of a week ago (Jan-2018). No Sucralose. Just avoid flavors like Cake Batter, Ice Cream and Banana.\n"", ""\n  Let me preface with, I have purchased this numerous times in the past, it's my go to flavor (Double Rich Chocolate) and tastes great. I ordered one recently and it had a cracked lid (image 1) (shipping box is undamaged), I figured these aren't air tight so probably no big deal however, it tasted disgusting which I attributed to the cracked lid so I ordered a replacement.Replacement came, cracked lid again, not quite as bad as the first (image 2) (shipping box is in perfect shape), didn't even break the seal and ordered another replacement.Second replacement came, no cracked lid but tastes just as disgusting as the first one. I don't know what happened with these recent orders but these are undrinkable, they taste watered down and leave a horrible cardboard/chemical taste in my mouth.I ordered a 10lb bag in the hopes that it will come from a different batch because, as mentioned, this is my go to flavor and I know it normally tastes great.Normally a 5 star but for this order I'm adding a 1 star review to their repertoire.UPDATE: I received my 10LB bag and it tastes great so there is definitely a bad batch of powder out there, maybe it's a bad batch of tubs, not sure but glad I finally have more powder.\n"", '\n  I ordered the double rich chocolate (DBC), thanks to reviews indicating it did not use sucralose (and it does not as of 06/12/18).I\'ve never used ON before, I do not know if it ""used to"" taste better. As of 06/12/18 the DBC flavor tastes roughly like burnt brownie flavored cardboard. Thing is, I understand without a SUPER sweetener, it can be difficult to achieve flavor, but be forewarned, it is AWFUL tasting. Consistency remains almost the same as whatever liquid you have mixed it into (adds no extra thickness). I tried both water and milk.On the positive front, it is jam packed with goodies with every scoop. It mixes extremely well (I use milk mainly) and when mixed with other powders, it continued to mix well (I add extra probiotics and stuff for my joints).I let it sit for a few hours on the counter, everything settled and needed a slight jostle, but (aside from being warm) mixed right back up and tasted exactly the same with the same consistency, which is great as I have had powders that turn to sludge if you let it sit for too long.For the price @5lbs and 30g scoops, you can\'t beat it. There are better tasting powders and better powders overall, but you can expect to pay $50-$60 for 2lb for those, I find this powder to be an excellent middle ground if you can stomach it, especially with the prevalence of sucralose finding its way everywhere.For those not in the know, please Google sucralose, it won\'t bother everyone, but if you\'re like me, it did affect my digestive system negatively and since removing it from my diet I have been doing much better.\n', '\n  I’m not a body builder by any means. I work out about three times a week and I use the protein powder for a post work out shake or for a quick breakfast. I’m not on strict diets or anything like that, so my review is from a regular joe who works our mostly to stay in decent shape and stay alive. The protein powder as a shake is pretty delicious. No weird aftertaste like many other powders, and it’s really filling. I’m sure most “pros” know all the tips but for those of you that don’t, it helps if you mix the powder with whatever liquid you prefer, I use soy milk, before adding ice. If you put everything in at the same time the powder gets clumpy. I don’t know why, but that’s been my experience. I use a blender not a shaker. Again, the chocolate malt is what I like and it tastes great.\n', '\n  It tasted like vomit! My husband and I try different flavors every time we order .. this by far is the worst I have ever tried!
