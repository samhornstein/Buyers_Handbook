This is very good because any lose in-ear buds will lose not only volume, but the bass quality of a song.• Very plain looking. No branding as they look like just any regular earbuds. Big fan of this because; One, less likely to get stolen, and two, they’re discrete looking. I’m not a fan of being a walking billboard on tech that I already paid money for. This is why I respect that Amazon isn’t following that system with these buds (except for the case, but nobody is perfect).• If you’re indoors, these little guys are just the same as if you have an Amazon Echo in your ear. You don’t need to press anything but just say “Alexa,” and Alexa will be ready to go.• It didn’t take long for me to go get used to the touch controllers. Amazon also went a step further to allow you to customize the function of them. (I just stuck to what was already programmed because the layout they provided is very easy to master.)• No issues when I got sweaty while I was running with them. As Amazon requests, you need to clean them after you take them off. I just used my shirt and it was fine, nothing fancy.• The earbuds know when you take them out of your ear and will pause your music the moment it leaves your ear. I try to trick this feature, but the earbuds weren’t fooled. You can restart your music either asking Alexa or just tap the earbud.• The sound is good but not Air Pods or Bose level. The sound isn’t bloated, has decent bass, and overall has decent balance tones. The best music for this is in the middle that doesn’t rely on a strong bass or deeper sound levels (will explain more later on).• I did hear a decent amount of reduction of sound thanks to Amazon's/Bose's noise-reduction software. Note, this isn't a noise-canceling but it blocks out smaller sounds like the humming sound when your refrigerator turns on, or the sound of cars going by if you’re inside. These types of small sounds are blocked by this software and it does a decent job.• You can use one earbud independently. I found this feature the best when you’re driving. Taking phone calls and even asking directions by using Alexa is definitely a useful tool to use when driving.• If you have an Amazon Echo at home, these earbuds will allow you to make an audio call right to the Echo. Tested this out and it works fine. The response and the receiving end didn’t have any issues. I believe you can also do this feature with any of your friends who have an Echo, but I have to assume they’re some restrictors so you don’t call them in the middle of the night.• With three built-in microphones in each earbud, I felt the call quality to be excellent.• Amazon has added a “sidetone” feature which allows you to hear your voice inside the earbuds. I believe with this you can modulate your voice so Alexa can be able to recognize your voice better when you’re in a loud environment. It’s an interesting tool to have, but you need the app for this.• A built-in quick charge feature on the case will allow the battery to gain a 50% increase in battery life around 20 minutes. What I like about the battery layout specifically is it will show you when you have a lot (green light), an all right (yellow light), or a poor battery life (red light). You can also just check the app, or ask Alexa, but this way is quicker to know right away.• The wingtips that come with these earbuds are useful if you want to feel a little more comfortable that your buds won’t fall out. Even with the soft silicone cover, I honestly didn’t feel the need to wear them as the earbuds stick pretty well in your ear (or at least in my ear). This will probably be different for you, given different ear sizes.• Amazon makes the earbuds visually identifiable for which ear it goes in to. A small feature but very useful in any day to day lifestyle.• The case is small enough to put it in your pocket, with your phone.• You can still use Siri if you want as well as Apple Music and Spotify.• I have an iPhone and so far there have been no disconnections between the earbuds and the phone.Cons and Oks:__________• Micro USB instead of USB-C for charging. Amazon is not letting this go and I have no idea why.• I had no issue with my fit, but they're pretty bulky for earbud size. Depending on your ear size, some may find the fit uncomfortable. My advice is to read what others have to say to get an accurate level. As stated they fit me fine, but I will update you if it changes.• Alexa will not work in loud environments. Just walking on the streets, with average traffic noises, Alexa wasn’t able to hear my voice. I had to put a lot of effort into getting Alexa to work when facing the outside world. Inside is fine but for loud areas, be warned.• No volume controls on the buds. You have to either ask Alexa or use the app. If you’re in a loud environment Alexa will not be helpful, as they basically become wired headphones (without the wire).• As I mention before, these are not “noise-canceling” but just reduces the noises around you. From my experience, this feature will not help you when you’re on a plane. It’s still an upgrade from not having anything, but it will not block all medium/loud sounds.• No wireless charging for the case. You’re stuck with Micro USB.• Without connected to your phone, and no Wi-Fi, Alexa will not work. I wish they created an offline Alexa so simple tasks such as increasing the volume can be performed. You can’t use any features without Wi-Fi.• I notice the case scratches the same day I got it. In your pocket with your keys, this case will show the scratches.• Battery life isn’t great. Around 4.30 hours of use before charging them back in the case. It’s cool that there is a quick charge on the case, but if you forget to charge the case then you’re pretty limited with time. This battery life isn’t horrible, but it sure isn’t great enough to be a pro.• Remember, as with any Alexa, Amazon may potentially review your Alexa voice recording. This is why Alexa needs to be connected online to be used. All interactions go to the cloud because, like the Echo, Alexa is always listening. You can manually delete your Alexa interactions, but that itself is going to be time-consuming, and most of us will forget to keep doing that.• If you disable Alexa then you’re restricted to just basic Bluetooth headphones.• When you adjust the volume, with having the noise reduction active, the music changes in the tune. It only happens for a couple of seconds, but I notice it enough to make a note and see if anyone else has the same issue. Note, it does go away quickly.• It took me a couple of tries to connect it with my iPhone. I had to manually pair them first on the iPhone before using the Alexa app.• You can customize the action touch layout of the earbuds, but you’re very limited in customization.• You also need to install the Alexa app if you want to use these earbuds fully. Amazon is pretty strict about the environment you need to be in.• I’m not a fan of the volume. At a low volume level, the quality of any sound becomes muddy while at high levels weren’t impressive at all. They’re still respected headphones, but I wish the volume levels performed better in the hardware.• Make sure you place the earbuds properly in the case. A couple of times the charging contacts didn’t sit properly against the case.• The phone calls are very clear with your voice but I could still hear background noises when I gave the earbuds to a friend. He was in a room with a football game on TV, at a reasonable volume level.• Around 5-6 mandatory agreements, you need to agree to if you want to use Alexa or configure with Amazon’s Alexa’s app.Bottom Line:__________Amazon always tries to find the middle ground in the quality of a product and the price you’re paying. To summarize, these earbuds fit without any wobble, all of Alexa is right in your ear, the noise reduction software does its job well, and it has a great microphone setup. I respect that there are no logos on the buds themselves and to be able to have a case to keep your earbuds charged on the go is right on point.But to compete with Apple or Samsung, sadly I don’t think so. You have to allow Alexa to be on all the time, which reduces an already weak battery system. And if you disable Alexa then most features are limited, such as not being able to increase/decrease the volume (you will have to go on your phone)/ Also, I’m not a fan of the battery life and of course Micro USB (Amazon, please kill this) is still there, which means no wireless charging.To be honest I felt these earbuds could be worth a little less than what they're asking. Still good earbuds, but I felt the sound isn’t anything to brag about. If you don’t want to afford the pricing of Apple, Google, or Bose earbuds, and you hate the reviews of Samsung earbuds, then this is worth it. I will say the best part of Amazon is they always have sale discounts so if these hit the $99 range you better pick them up. Just be aware you must enjoy the earbuds with the use of Alexa. If you don’t want that, then these are not worth the price.Overall: Not the best in overall quality but the best in establishing Amazon’s Echo in earbud form.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer\n"", '\n  I\'m a tech early adopter. I\'m used to things being a little janky but functional. That describes the original v1 Kindle, but I always felt like the product was working. Like I was getting the intended experience from it. These things are not ready for wide release. Every time I interact with them, they\'re misbehaving in a different way. Why does the case light only blink red, no matter the charge? Why does one bud or the other (it\'s random!) lose charge more quickly during each use? Why is it that sometimes I have to remove the buds from my phone\'s Alexa app, then go through re-pairing? Why don\'t double taps work more than half the time? Why is ""press and hold"" sometimes instant and sometimes takes up to three seconds? Why do I sometimes hear the whispers of long dead relatives come from the ear buds? Mom? Is that you? AND WHY do these echo buds start to feel heavy the longer you wear them? How does that work? I don\'t know! It\'s a mystery!\n', ""\n  I was so excited to get these. Alexa in my ears? Sounds convenient! These could not be more disappointing. Amazon should have spent a considerable amount of time polishing out the bugs in these ear buds before releasing them. The number of issues I have with them is just unreasonable. They don't charge evenly in the case. Left bud will be at 18%, right at 99%. Obviously poor charger connections in the case. The sound is PATHETIC. These things are so quiet it's a joke. I have $20 Bluetooth headphones that make these sound like tin cans. I can hold a regular conversation at max volume while using these buds and that is unacceptable considering they're supposed to be noise canceling. Ha. The only way to control volume on these is by turning up your phone media volume and/or asking Alexa to turn the volume up. No volume controls in the Alexa app like they have for other sound devices. And the noise canceling?? Doesn't work at all. Passthrough? Basically just amplifies all outside noise so you feel like you're wearing hearing aids instead of headphones. The buds do not fit properly. They do not offer large enough tips. Period. I'm a 5 ft tall petite female and these things fall right out of my head with largest tips and wings in. Within 20 minutes of having them in my ears hurt so much I can't even keep them in my ears anymore. Pretty sure the smaller tips are made for children. The touch gestures are idiotic. You try to grab the bud falling out of your ear and it thinks you're using the touch gestures, but when you're actually trying to use the touch gestures the buds ignore your touch. Like they're laughing in your face. Can't share a bud with someone... If each person has a bud it won't play music in one bud even if you're standing right next to each other. Multiple times they have just flat out stopped playing a song right in the middle of it for no reason. One of the most annoying problems??? These buds do not function in tandem with any other Amazon devices which is beyond asinine. Please do yourself a favor and do not waste money on these pieces of trash. I have nothing positive to say about them at all. I'm returning these overpriced pieces of junk.\n"", '\n  In theory these should be great, but they are not.As Earbuds go they sound pretty good and are pretty comfortable, but the way they work is not good.  The issues I keep having are:1.  They say connected to BT but will not work, or the audio side does not connect.2.  The BT connection keeps dropping audio which is very annoying and beats the point of having these.3.  The Buttons (touch) are most often un responsive, or select the wrong thing.4.  When you ask for Alexa, you have to pause until she responds before you can tell her what to do.5.  The graphic equalizer does not respond to what it should. (I wanted to have less bass, but it did not change.)6.  They also make a static like click when they engage sound for some reason.This reminds me of getting the Echo Auto.  Nice idea, but at first was rushed out to people before all the bugs were ironed out.\n']"

(I do own more expensive headphones and earbuds but sometimes it's good to have a few cheap options available in case something gets damaged or lost etc.) For the price, these are a good choice. Are there better sounding more durable earbuds out there? Yes, of course there are! That being said, you can have three or four sets of these, or, one pair that are more expensive... They paired with my iPhone XR without a problem. The charging case works fine, they sound fine for music and Netflix so far, and the fit is acceptable. Again, please remember the pricepoint here... I am not a fan of making/recieving phone calls using earbuds because it seems like the other person has trouble hearing me a lot of the time. So as far as that feature is concerned, I can't comment on it yet as I just don't use it. How long will they last? I have no idea. If things go downhill, I'll update my review.\n"", '\n  \xa0Great product, came quickly sounds is definitely loud enough for me! earbuds no buttons touch sensitive cool charging case.\n', '\n  So my wife took her headphones for a walk and got stuck in the pouring rain! Low and behold, she gets back from the walk and they are completely dead. I went on Amazon and found these earbuds that have the look of the Apple AirPod pros, and thought I’d give it a shot.Product arrived today and played around with it.In the box came the charging case (with earbuds inside), charging cable, other earbud sizes, quick start instructions, full manual, and 24 month warranty card (which was longer than I thought it was).The charging case has a magnetic top, so it doesn’t open up by accident. The two earbuds are also magnetically held in the case, which is great. Just get close to putting it in the case, and the magnets pull it right in.They easily connected to the iPhone and sounds great. The battery seems to last a long time, and the case will charge the earbuds 7 times before having to charge the case, which is phenomenal.Easy controls on them.. just tap on it and pause the music. A call comes in, tap on either earbud and answer the call. Tap again and hang up. Sound on the phone is great, as if you’re talking on the actual phone.I would recommend these headphone for anyone that’s looking for a less expensive alternative than Apple, and/or want a long warranty period.\n', ""\n  This is a Great wireless headset for the price! What I like about this product is that it comes in a cute small black charging case. Just plug it in and it charges the headset. The rubberized earbuds make it comfortable and easy to put in your ears and feel secure that they won't fall out. I love that the product comes with an additional pair of rubberized earbuds in case you lose one or need a different size. The sound quality is wonderful and it synchronizes with your phone within seconds. I purchased this for my son for Christmas and now my daughter wants one after trying it out! This is a great buy!!!!!\n"", ""\n  I have been in need of a new pair of bluetooth earbuds for a while. I was pleasantly surprised to find this affordable pair by Aukey.I also have Aukey charging cables and Aukey bluetooth transmitter for my car that I bought months ago. I find their products to be extremely high quality for such an affordable price. I've become a fan of this brand over the last few months!I had a feeling these bluetooth earbuds would be excellent for my needs, but I'm really impressed by the quality. They fit very well, sound is excellent, charging/carrying case is perfectly compact, and battery life is better than expected.I was able to use the bathroom at work today and I didn't have to pause my podcast... I was able to keep listening with these earbuds about 20 feet away from my device. Silly, but pretty cool.I HIGHLY recommend these earbuds! I like them so much thinking about getting a 2nd pair. One for home & one to keep at work.\n"", ""\n  I was not expecting much from these little guys. First off they came in a plain cardboard and felt way too light. Packaging was tight. But good. The case came out easy. Instructions at the bottom. Ear tips and USB cable.The case is small, thin, and extremely light. The case feels flimsy but not too bad. Case latches nicely and doesn't fly open easily.  Wish it was USB C but can't complain for the price.The buds are super light. Has indicator lights for syncing, when connected and when low power. The tips fit nicely. I was lucky to get a good seal with the stock pair of tips. The buds are light so it doesn't drag on your ears. They're a bit thicker than airpods but lighter. The fit is better with the orientation a bit more forward than hanging straight down like airpods. They are comfortable and don't hurt my ears after a couple hours. They work independently of each other. It does make a weird pause and beep when connecting separately though.This is where I was floored. The sound is really big for the price. These sound really good. The volume is great  not the loudest but good volume. The only thing they lack is clarity in the mids. It's not muddy but just not all there. The bass is sufficient, pretty much airpods level. The highs are very crisp. These may be a tad high heavy but everything sounds amazing for this price. Amazing!Because these are airpods style with the mic hanging down call quality is pretty decent. Not airpods good but decent.The touchpads work great! And battery life is decent. Lasted me about 3 hours on a charge.For the price, these are great. No brainier if you don't mind the airpods style. The toothbrush hanging from your ears. I don't mind and will be using these often.\n"", ""\n  I've bought a lot of wireless earbuds trying to find the ones that are right for me and these are easily in the top 10% in terms of audio quality and fidelity. There's a ok amount of bass but mids and highs are perfect. The fact that these use the APT-X codec is probably a factor in why these sound so good.these are using a Qualcomm technology called TWS Plus as opposed to the standard TWS. The previous generation of ear buds I bought relied on one bud to act as master and the 2nd bud to be slave. This TWS Plus generation equally distributes the processing to both buds and greatly increases battery life and signal strength. I have had no cut outs or signal issues with these buds.As is pretty standard, they came with several sets of the ear pieces, and I was able to easily find one that fit my ears. They are comfortable, and work great for music, videos and calls.\n"", ""\n  I'm really impressed with the sound quality of these buds. The bass is amazing without being too invasive and blurring the audio in your ear so that's a huge plus for me. These are super comfortable in the ear, they feel light and smooth and it even comes with the various ear-tips so you change sizes if needed. They have touch controls i.e. double tap to play/pause (this is perfect because my previous  pair would play/pause or hang up calls when all I wanted to do was adjust them in my ear - I couldn't do that without turning off my song or hanging up calls by mistake which was annoying - I won;t have that problem now!). The instructions are very clear so there shouldn't be any problem figuring out the touch controls in case you're worried about it! These can also be paired individually so you're not forced to have both on at the same time (I like to alternate sometimes so I can hear what's going on around me). Even with one in the sound isn't unbalanced so another positive. Would 100% recommend buying these.\n"", ""\n  1. Excellent fit - lightweight and comfortable, sturdy and remains solidly in the ear even when you're moving around.2. Big range of earbud adaptors provided with the headphones.3. Sound quality is amazing for such a small device - great all round sound, excellent for both watching films and listening to music. Volume is good enough to cover background noise such as public transport. Bass is very impressive in such a small unit!4. Ability to control by tap touch means you don't have to get your phone out of your pocket and have a wide range of control options.5. Simple, easy to follow quick start instructions and a good user manual detailing the various touch options.6. Incredibly quick and reliable Bluetooth pairing - fastest I've seen.I honestly can't really fault the product, it's a massive upgrade to the bluetooth headphones I had previously.Very impressed with these, I did not expect them to be such good value for the price.\n"", '\n  These Aukey wireless earphones are perfect. I have been working from home for some time and fed up with wearing a headset. I was unable to pair my well-known headphones to my work laptop and getting frustrated. I found these and very glad I did.They arrived next day in a very compact recyclable package. Unpacked, charged and paired to my laptop in no time. Really simple process. Did the same with my phone and tablet and just as simple and successful each time.The headphones have all the features you would like in a headset, and once I had selected the correct fittings for my ears they fitted perfectly and do not fall out. I have tried eating with them in, running and wrestling with my little boy and they still have not fallen out.Having them work with my business laptop helps enormously, as I am now able to wear them for conference calls and the feedback from meeting attendees is that they can hear me perfectly and I can hear them clearly too ..... and when not in meetings can listen to music from my iPhone too, with the added benefit of being able to answer the phone with them also..... and they work with Siri ......Perfect.If you are looking for quality in-ear headphones, with the features you would expect and at a great price, I would highly recommend these. I am really pleased I bought them. 5 stars from me.\n', '\n  PROS:- Neat sturdy little box which looks nice and is a good size to carry around.- Headphones connect immediately and there\'s no delay.- Sound quality is pretty good for the price, an everyday listener won\'t have any issues with the sound.- Pretty comfortable to wear and don\'t fall out of the ear easily.- Charge stays for a good amount of time and the charging case is really useful.CONS:- Touch is very inconsistent. It\'s may or may not work. Even after finding the right ""spot"", it\'s not reliable. So, if you need your touch to work really well, don\'t have an expectations.- While the earphones don\'t necessarily fall out they can get a bit loose if you\'re yawning/chewing. Maybe it\'s because the earbud isn\'t perfect for my ear but just thought I\'d mention it.- It sometimes has connectivity issues with my MacBook (a slight delay) but connects immediately with an Android.Overall for the price it\'s a good buy and would recommend if you don\'t have high expectations :)\n']"

No matter how hard I try, they fall out of my ear in less than a minute. I thought I would try a different brand, and when I put these in my ear, they fell out within seconds. I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I’m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!The quality of sound is impeccable, nice highs and lows, with a decent amount of bass. Once I found the right match, the fit was extremely comfortable.I love these headphones, they have already changed my life for the better!\n"", ""\n  I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.\n"", '\n  Connected these to my fire stick, which is why I purchased it so I can watch tv while my husband is sleeping. The volume on the ToZo was extremely loud. I wasn’t able to adjust it not even with the tv or fire stick remote. The volume can only be controlled when connected to your phone or tablet. I bought this on Prime Day thinking I was getting a good deal and Paid $49.99 with $3 off but found out other purchase this for around $25/$30. Two stars because they work find when connected to a phone or table but that’s not what I purchased them for.UPDATE REVIEW...This is an update. TOZO Customer service is wonderful they reached out to me to rectify the issue. They issued another TOZO Bluetooth. The previous one works great with my devices just not with my smart tv. Haven’t tried the new one yet but Will keep you posted.  Thanks TOZO\n', ""\n  Every Christmas I usually have enough personal money to make an impulse purchase, usually in Electronics. This year, I wanted to upgrade the $20 pair of totally wireless sound (TWS) earbuds I had. They were good, but needed better sound to make them perfect.With a budget of about $100, I started off looking for something good from a known manufacturer (like Samsung, Jabra, etc.) There was just nothing out there in my price range. I couldn't see myself paying that kind of money from a brand I didn't know, so I started looking for a cheaper model. For around $50 I found 3-4 that looked good and reviews were good enough. I liked Anker's other Bluetooth earphones, so the Soundcore Liberty Lites were considered. With the good reviews and previous good ownership of Monoprice products the Monoprice IPX4s were looking good, too.Due diligence and a desire to be able to use one earbud at a time drive me to search Amazon's best rated under $50 TWS sets, and Tozo looked pretty good. While the buds are labeled L and R, they are both the same, and can be put into either ear. They come with 4 tips, and for the first time, I'm not using the largest ones. So if you have really big ear canals and find it hard to get tips that fit, you may find a good fit here.The sound won't knock Bose out of the water, but for the forty dollars I paid, it is good, and an outstanding upgrade from my $20 pair. It has nice bass, and well defined mids and highs.Battery time is right around 4 hours at low volume (I wear them at work as background noise). The travel case can charge one while the other is playing, so I don't find it hard to get through a work day with them. I like the charging case, too. It's well built, and can use a Qi wireless charger, which I don't care about really. There are 4 lights to tell you how charged it is. it closes and fits in a pocket. I can't tell you how many charges it will take, because I usually keep it plugged in.Pairing, once initially done, is easy. Just pull a bud off the charger and it will turn on and start looking for your paired device. Since I'm using one at a time, I find I need to turn the one I'm using off completely first, then get the other one. I paired them first together, and then separate. This is the best part of these for me, almost seamless use.All in all, very happy with the purchase. And I save up some money to get something else. I have already recommended these to people (my brother is not convinced, he has bone conducting headphones he likes). I do like them that much.\n"", ""\n  \xa0I upgraded from Tozo T8 to the T10 and also own a pair of wireless earbuds from a well known Brand associated with fruit, and have to say I am very impressed with the TOZO T10 in comparison to the other that I own.First of all, They are great value. The set up was very straight forward and connected to my devices bluetooth in a few seconds. When you pick the earbuds up out of the case they automatically attach to each other and have useful light indicators. The case also has light indicators to show the charge level which is very helpful.The waterproof feature is very useful as I'm often worried about headphones if it is raining etc.They fit in my ear nicely and don't fall out as there is a selection of attachment earpiece sizes to best fit the size of your ear.Nice presentation in the box and good clear instructions.The sound is really nice, I have listened to a selection of songs and audiobooks etc and the sound is up there with some of the best sounding earbuds I've used, very clear with good sound range / overall levels and I'd definitely recommend them!The sound range distance is good, I walked downstairs in my home and continued to listen to the headphones no problem (under 10 metres).The case and earbuds feel very premium, there is even a lanyard included for carrying around your neck or hanging on a hook etc.For the price you can't go wrong, also supports wireless charging which I might have to try out as well!I've added an unboxing video plus some photos to help show what's included too.Thanks for reading my review and hopefully this might've helped in your decision to try out these brilliant headphones if you do decide to get these. Happy listening!\n"", ""\n  So I bought these headphones for a single purpose - use in the hot tub (I already use AirPods for running/exercise and some noise-cancelling Bose headphones for when I'm at work)... I have to admit they were a bit of a shot-in-the-dark and I honestly wasn't expecting much from them, especially as I used to have some cheaper headphones for running that were terrible, and really put me off the 'budget' price point.Now these are clearly not AirPod or Bose standard, but frankly for the price they sound excellent. Crystal clear treble and more than enough low-end for me... using my go to track (Wilderness from Clannad's Anam) they have good definition and far exceeded my expectations.They are much larger than AirPods, and you MUST ensure they are correctly positioned (with the right-sized rubber ends on) or the sound quality drops dramatically - but after a few minutes of getting this right (as a one off) they more than meet the requirements. The size isn't really a hinderance to them, because it lets them sit in the ears quite comfortably - but your mileage might vary (with ear size).I haven't had them long enough to gauge battery life, but the wireless charging feature of the case works fine from my standard charging mat.So the TL;DR... really good value for money and surprisingly high sound quality - Recommend!(For full disclosure they cost £29.99 when I bought them and TOZO have offered me an extra wireless charger, no strings attached - but the later has not influenced my review, other than encouraging me to write it).\n"", ""\n  I bought these to take on holiday to Spain, I intended lots of beach and poolside music listening and didn't fancy the wires or bulkiness of my existing headphones. In ear and wire free was a must and having compared many of the headphones on Amazon I ended up choosing these.I wasn't expecting much for the price paid, but first impressions were very positive. The packaging is excellent and suggests premium quality. The charging case is much sturdier than I imagined and the earbuds themselves smaller than I imagined (in a good way).I used the earbuds and charging case daily whilst on holiday for anything from 1-5 hours at a time without any issue. The sound quality is surprisingly very good, a much better bass than I was expecting. Everything seemed nice and clear. I never intended to keep using them daily on my return from holiday, but I have. They are fine when walking too, I expected them to fall out but they don't. I'm not sure I'd trust running in them though.The jury is still out on the long term longevity and battery life a few months down the line, but I'll be happy to revisit this review and update it in a few months if my opinion changes.\n"", '\n  The sound cancellation is really amazing, I couldn’t hear anything else but my music.The quality is good in itself, I had another pair of wireless earphones and it made me unsure if I should buy another pair as the sound quality want good, but these are amazing.They’re easy to use and connected to my phone within seconds, overall really love these\n', '\n  \xa0I have to say these ear buds are great quality both made and for comfort worked straight out of the box and you can even carge the box with a QI wireless charging pad or through the cable it has different size ear buds for comfort and ive included a small video but if your thinking of buying some then just spend a little bit more and buy these because the sound quality is great\n']"

I am a professional musician by trade and these have incredibly clear sound quality, really high end parts put into this product.The connection is fast and easy, it charges while in the case which is a great feature but better than all these features I love the ability to wear them in the shower and jam to tunes while they get soaked and survive it like a champ. Really high end headphones for a amazingly good price. I would recommend these to anyone looking for Bluetooth headsets similar to those made by Apple but for a far less price and also BETTER bass response!!The touch controls on the side are fantastically good if you wanted to pause music or youtube at work when someone asks you a question so you can hear them without taking the headset out. They are incredibly good at isolating and even at the lowest volume they can shut out the world around you. I wear them everywhere and love them so much.They come with a charge case, 3 extra sets of ear tips to fit whatever size ear you have, a charge cable for charging the case (micro usb) and a one year warrantee!Do yourself a favor and get a set of these superb Bluetooth earbuds!Did I mention they are waterproof?! IPX8 Waterproof!!\n', ""\n  This is the second time I reviewed this company's products. I'm sort of a earbud Junkie, and make a lot of purchases. About six months ago I purchased the older version of these headphones, and fell in love. I was looking on Amazon to see what other products this company had, and if there was any new versions. I was pleasantly surprised to see be upgraded version of headphones so I found a reason to order the newest set by giving my children my old set. I work in construction and listen to audio books all day long keep from going crazy , my job is incredibly boring. Because my job keeps me from home for such a longperiod. I only use one earbud at a time. I insert the first one around 3 a.m. and begin my stories, I swap it out around lunch and the second one last me until 4:30 in the afternoon when I get home. In the past with other brands I've had I'd have to swap out my earbuds about every 2 hours, not with these. The newest version that I'm reviewing is even better than the last, both in battery power, insound, an ability to connect to my phone. One problem that I've noticed I've had in the past with the charging boxes is that the magnets are almost never strong enough to keep the earbud from falling off while charging, this newest version has an incredibly strong making. It doesn't help that I have fat fingers then make it difficult for me to grasp small things. Hahaha, they did a great job we're including super strong magnets they will ensure that these earbuds keep charging for the next use. I threw my phone in one of my back pockets of my pants and this new version ensures you don't lose connection no matter which way you turn your head. They're incredibly loud and clear so that when you're in a noisy environment you can still hear what you're listening to. It took me a moment to get use to the fact that the buttons are touch activated rather than traditional buttons, but I quickly became acustomed to brushing the face of the earphone. Its nice as now when I set them in my ear I dont knock them out when trying to pause my audiobooks when people are trying to talk to me. In my last review of this company's products I said they have a customer for life, and I gladly say it again.\n"", '\n  Update: After about a year of use, we ran into some trouble with these headphones. They are constantly disconnecting from bluetooth and one of the earbuds is super quiet. I messaged Tozo to inquire about the warranty, and they are sending a full replacement. Two thumbs up for their customer service!I have a young teenage son who wanted a pair of AirPods, as he was sick of headphones with wires. I was unwilling to get him something so expensive, so we compromised with these, as it won’t be as big of a deal if he loses them!I already own and love a pair of Tozo T-10s, but he wanted a pair with a much smaller case that will fit in his pocket at school. These fit the bill! They’re about 1/4 inch wider and just slightly taller than airpods. He’s super happy with the size.The lid is magnetic and closes with an audible clack just like AirPods. Apparently my teen thinks this is important, ha ha.Charging via a charging pad works great. My son really likes the four bright lights that tell him how much charge is left. He says he’s used them all week and hasn’t had to recharge his case yet.The sound seems good. My son has no complaints whatsoever. I borrowed them for a few hours to listen to podcasts, and the sound was good for that.One thing that I wish was like the T-10 is that it does not appear that you can pair one earbud to one device, and the other earbud to another device.  My phone just recognizes these as Tozo-T6. The T-10s show as Tozo-T10-R (or L), which allows me to pair them as two separate devices. I wish this had that. But my son could care less, as he doesn’t own more than one device. :)Overall, my son loves these and is totally happy to have these and not AirPods. The model number suggests that maybe it’s a lower mode number than the T-10, but I think these actually might be a newer, upgraded version.\n', '\n  \xa0I have been using this earbuds for sometime now and these are perfect!. I was able to use this for long hours without getting ear pain. Sound quality is absolutely amazing and its very easy to carry in your pocket while traveling. I highly recommend this product.\n', ""\n  Let’s face it, if anyone is looking to buy a pair of in ear wireless headphones then opting for the Apple AirPods is where almost all of us would start looking. But with so many other options now on the market is there something that is able to do the job (or even a better job) for a fraction of the cost....we’ll, yes there is!The Tozo T6 headphones are a great option for anyone looking for their first delve into wireless headphone territory.Firstly the form factor is great, they don’t have the annoying stick down the side of the ear unlike Apple AirPods, these are confined to your actual ear, if you wear a scarf it means you won’t dislodge these, and with a true in ear seal, which is made even better with so many ear cup options they fit very snugly without being tight or uncomfortable. the case also mirrors the Apple style with magnets to hold them into place with a handy charge light on the case, the nicely clicking opening hinge further gives joy when opening the up, one minor gripe is that they can be a bit fiddly to get out, but I’ve always managed.Functionality of these is also excellent, you can play, pause, skip, rewind, even turn volume up and down with only the touch to the headphones (something which is way ahead of the apple ones) They even speak back to you what option you’ve selected which is very helpful so you know if it’s understood what you've asked for.Sound quality is excellent for a pair of wireless headphones, especially at the price point. The fact that they seal completely in your ear gives great passive noise cancellation, and although when playing some songs they can be a little soft in the mid and lacking in base, just tweaking Spotify’s EQ to bass boost gives a lovely rich warm sound which is excellent.I can’t comment on battery life as yet, but other users seem impressed, and Tozo Claim 5 hours of music playback, which is far longer than my 1 hour commute so it’s fine for my (and probably most peoples) needs.As seen on the photo they come with micro USB charging case and instructions, but are very easy to set up and pair straight from the box.In summary these are an excellent pair of headphones from a sound, comfort, form factor and the all important, price point. Would definitely recommend them.(And for those wondering, yes I do own a pair of Apple AirPods too...)\n"", '\n  Really nice product. I couldnt justify spending £150+ on apple airpods when these looked so appealing especially the price! The reviews on amazon were all very positive so i thought i would give them a try. I havnt been left disappointed... this product in my eyes is just as good as any other on the market. They fit perfectly and come with alternative ear sizing pieces where you can change them to whatever suits your ear for comfort. Really happy... going to buy another pair for my partner.\n', '\n  I\'ve used wireless earbuds for a while, and I\'m generally a fan of my B&O E8 2.0s. However, I have been shopping around for a while for new earbuds to use as a backup for a few reasons:- The leather case on the B&Os feels premium, but it\'s not exactly practical for the gym- Connectivity on the B&O is not perfect when on the move, especially when your phone is close to your bodyBeing broadly satisfied with TOZO products (love their screen protectors for my Samsung Note 9), I decided to give these wireless earbuds a chance. They came promptly. The box has a real premium feel, and the earbuds are nicely packed inside, with the standard plastic protection you would expect from a premium product. Algotether, the presentation feels more Apple-y than I was expecting (which is a really good thing!).Taking the wrapper off of the case, it\'s very similar in size, shape & design to the Airpod case (which was the obvious inspiration). I was a little disappointed -- but not surprised -- to see a Micro-USB port on the bottom instead of a USB-C port; however, wireless charging works as advertised. The case shape is also nice because it\'s not as thick as the ""losenge"" case of the E8s -- it\'s much easier to slip into a pocket.When you take the buds out of the case for the first time, they immediately drop into pairing mode, and I was paired and running in less than 30 seconds. My phone reports they prefer to stream in AAC, which is kind of what you would expect for buds in this price range.In terms of signal strength and stability of connection, these blow the B&Os completely out of the water. With the B&Os, if I had my phone in the back left pocket, the signal would drop the moment I moved to a noisy environment. With the TOZO pair, the connection stays solid and reliable.In terms of audio quality, I\'m no audiophile but the TOZOs are clearly more bass-heavy than my E8s -- this actually makes them nicer for pop and mainstream music in certain scenarios. I\'ve also taken a few calls on these and my voice has come through without much issue (which is actually an improvement on the E8s, which aren\'t known for their microphone quality).All told, these are good ""starter"" earbuds, and also a good companion for someone who may have a much pricier set which they don\'t want to take to the gym / in the rain. They are excellent value for the price.\n', ""\n  I have been searching for ages for some Bluetooth earphones which are waterproof/sweatproof, have good sound quality and are similar to Airpods in design without the Apple price. Well look no further, these tick all the boxes!They look great and much more expensive than they are. The charging case is perfect and works well to keep them charged up and has LED lights on the front to indicate how much charge it has left. In terms of the headphone design, I was worried that they would fall out all the time, especially as I wanted to use them for running, but with all the different size ear pieces, I found a perfect fit and so far they haven't budged. It takes a little bit of getting used to if you haven't used similar in-ear headphones before but they fit well and are comfortable to wear for a prolonged amount of time. Just make sure to place them in and twist them for a secure fit. The sound is of a really good quality with a good bass and is good at cancelling background noise. The touch function to change and pause songs works smoothly and is simple, with just a slight delay from command to it doing what you've asked. Pairing the device was so simple and once you've paired once it will remember your device. You can turn on/off both earpieces individually so make sure you have turned both on to get the sound in both - you can also used just one ear piece if you would like.These are a really great product, especially for the price! Just be aware they do not come with a charger so I have been on the hunt for a micro-USB cable and will eventually buy their wireless charging pad - another pro of them is that they support wireless charging. Another positive is how quick the delivery was - ordered them Sunday evening and received them by lunchtime Monday.\n"", '\n  -I wanted a bit of time to test these out properly before reviewing so a few weeks later here goes:-Fast delivery and in good quality packaging (not excessive)-I purchased the white headphones, they look and feel great quality for the cost and the colour seems slightly pearlised which I love!-Worked straight out of the box and has an 18month warranty sticker included to register-Sound quality is great - I like quite bass heavy music (RnB, Dancehall, House) as well as classical and some rock so I tested a wide variety of music genres and also films and I am impressed with the quality in comparison to bigger brands used, the bass is just right and all sounds seem crisp and clear and the volume is more than sufficient unless you really want to wreck your eardrums!-Love the wireless charging feature and it’s so fast too, the headphones held a good 4+hrs continuous charge on highest volume for me which I think is excellent-Headphones feel really stable in your ears (several buds to chose from so should fit majority of people well)-Very touch responsive and really easy to operate-Tested falls on them too and whilst I don’t really use them for this often it worked well enough and was clear for me and the other caller-I was able to move around the entire house and into the garden and not lose any sound quality-These are excellent true wireless headphones for the price and I have and would definitely recommend them!\n']"

So I checked the\n"", ""\n  A couple years ago, I ordered five well-rated headphones at once to compare quality over price. These were the overall winner, and I've purchased several more over time.Unfortunately, the latest batch is a completely different product. Either Panasonic started skimping on production or these are cheap counterfeits (more likely). I just plugged these into my electronic drum kit and literally could not hear the kick drum's bass sound at all. I thought my kit was messed up, but instead plugged in an older pair of these and noticed not only a clear rolling bass, but all of the sounds were much fuller and richer.It's a shame that Amazon isn't doing anything about counterfeiting. The positive reviews here are outdated and worthless.\n"", '\n  When I first opened these they fit very comfortable in my ears. When I tried listening to them the sound in the right ear kept shorting out.  Went to Amazon to try to return them and learned I could not return them even though I had just purchased them a few days ago.  Instead I was given the phone number to Panasonic customer support.  I was disconnected twice from customer  support while they tried to transfer me to the right person.  I realize these headphones we’re only $8 but it’s the principle of it that they make you jump through all of these hoops from the manufacturer to return a defective product. Normally Amazon returns items quickly with little effort.  Given all of the positive reviews of these headphones I am assuming I just got a defective pair.UPDATE:  I called Panasonic to start a return. They told me I would have to ship the $8 earbuds to them first then they would fix them and send them back to me. Very disappointed as it would cost me at least that much to ship them in the first place.  Not a fan of Panasonic right now and surely will never buy any Panasonic headphones again.\n', ""\n  I purchased a pair of these earphones in December 2017 due to the overwhelming number of positive reviews. When they first arrived I was so happy with the sound quality, comfort level in-ear, and their ability to block outside noise. I use my headphones for schoolwork or to watch movies on my computer; I am by no means rough with them, I store them carefully, I'd had my last pair for 8 years, etc. However, only one month after purchase, the left earphone suddenly shorted out and ceased working. I attempted to return them through Amazon and was instead told to contact Panasonic directly.I tried numerous times to use the Panasonic website's live chat support feature but kept getting a message that there were no employees on live chat at this time (no matter what time of day I tried). I then called their 1-888 support number and the first thing the automated message warned me was that I risked being charged a $9.99 service fee for help if I continued with the phone call and if my product turned out not to be covered under warranty. Given that I didn't know if the earphones were still covered under any limited warranty, I opted to just hang up at that point, write off my money spent, and order a second pair. They arrived on January 25, 2018, and again, I was satisfied. Less than two weeks later, while watching a homework video, the right earphone suddenly shorted out and stopped working.I called Panasonic again figuring that this time it had to be covered under some warranty at less than 2 weeks old. The customer service rep sent me the e-mail instructions to submit my proof of purchase for both pairs and I later received an e-mail back with the instructions for shipping the headphones. They stated that I was only allowed to ship the product in one specific type of corrugated cardboard container, that it needed to be  certain size of that container, and that I would need to pay for tracking and insurance on the product on top of the shipping. The total amount for shipping cost more than THREE pairs of these headphones and they wouldn't guarantee that they would send me two new pairs to replace the two broken ones.This is the worst experience I've ever had with a purchase from Amazon. I was disappointed and frustrated that I could not conduct my return directly through Amazon and have a replacement sent to me or my money refunded like is usually the case on Amazon, but instead had to do the whole runaround with Panasonic, and I still don't know whether Panasonic will honor its warranty and send me two new pairs. Based on the number of positive reviews for these earphones it seems like I did just get unlucky (twice) with defective pairs, however, if you're one of those unlucky ones you can count your money spent as lost based on the incredible hassle and lack of good customer service to make it right.\n"", '\n  So here\'s the thing: in recent years I\'ve spent way, way more than I care to admit on headphones. I have been trying desperately to find the perfect sound.Still haven\'t found it, but, I\'ve come to realize one very simple fact: convenience, comfort, and fit are more important than absolute audio quality. These buds nail that mix. They produce about 85% the sound quality as the best audio I\'ve heard, and fit exactly right for my ears like truly nothing else on the market.My previous go-tos were a pair of pricey earbuds with memory foam tips, and also ""audiophile"" Yuin PK1s that look like circa 1990 Gameboy earbuds.And yet... the memory foam buds were also too bulky for the foam to make a difference to fit... the PK1s are phenomenal when they are seated JUST SO in your ear, but don\'t you dare move your head, and anything approaching workout use is laughable. High end open backed over-ear 600ohm requires-an-amp cans may sound great, but are completely impractical for day to day use and travel scenarios (unless you\'re ""that guy/gal"" - and please don\'t be).So here\'s what I propose: forget the high end stuff and buy several pairs of these Panasonics. Throw one into your laptop/book bag, your purse/murse, your desk drawer... use and abuse them day in, day out. When they break, buy them again. They\'re cheap, and they work great.--------Other stuff:- Good bass, curtailed highs... far from reference, but well suited to the modern pop musics the kids listen to these days- Don\'t need a mic? You can save a few bucks and buy the HJE-120s instead- Short-ish chord is great for mobile use, but when seated at a desk don\'t forget they\'re in your ears if you try to stand up (ouch)- There\'s an audiophile term for when you can hear the wire moving and jostling about through the earbud. Can\'t remember what it is, but it applies to these- Very, very, very good fit. Leads to good bass, good sound isolation, and you simply forget they\'re there and focus on the music instead- Inline mic works! Surprisingly good quality in quiet environments, but clearly omnidirectional and prone to picking up ambient noise\n', ""\n  I've bought this model of Panasonic headphones numerous times before. I believe these are fakes. They came in small pouches instead of the usual hard plastc shell packaging. Also, the description said that 3 pairs of different sizes soft earpads were included, but I didn't get them. I can't use them because the pads are too big for my ears. Buyer beware!\n"", ""\n  I wanted a comfortable headset for zoom/skype calls as well as well as listening to music. I spent ages looking around and settled on these, almost in spite of their price. They didn't disappoint. People comment on the good mike sound when I'm on a call, and when Iisten to recordings of zoom calls I've been on, the sound quality is more pleasing that of some people wearing obviously expensive headsets with a mike near the mouth. It's a mellow but clear sound, not precise but harsh like many. The sound on the earbuds is also very pleasant.It doesn't seem prone to clothes rustling sounds transmitting to the mike, like many of this sort, or cable rustling sounds coming thru to the earbuds, although of course some of that happens.The connector feels sturdy, and hopefully less prone to disintegration that the straight connectors.And the hype is true, the earbuds themselves fit very neatly and comfortably.I've only had them a few weeks, so longevity is unknown.I dont usually review items, but felt that this deserves a shout-out, and I'd happily pay double the price.\n"", '\n  Cheap packackaging, hard to cut open. I could have easily forgiven that if the quality of the product had been better. They looked and felt cheap (flimsy cords) and the sound qulity was way more inferior than other products I have tried in the past. Tinny, no base. I honestly don\'t know how some users gave these good ratings. I ordered four pairs based on good reviews, ended up giving one pair away to my son who said ""they\'re better than nothing,"" and sent the other three back. Giving one star bc of sound quality. After all, that\'s why I bought them.\n', ""\n  ...How long they last.Purchased because of the Panasonic name, which I have come to trust as a sign of quality.Have to say these leave a little to be desired on that front, some what better than no name Chinese rubbish, but not what's expected of a premium brand.Disappointed.\n""]"

I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I’m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!The quality of sound is impeccable, nice highs and lows, with a decent amount of bass. Once I found the right match, the fit was extremely comfortable.I love these headphones, they have already changed my life for the better!\n"", ""\n  I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.\n"", '\n  Connected these to my fire stick, which is why I purchased it so I can watch tv while my husband is sleeping. The volume on the ToZo was extremely loud. I wasn’t able to adjust it not even with the tv or fire stick remote. The volume can only be controlled when connected to your phone or tablet. I bought this on Prime Day thinking I was getting a good deal and Paid $49.99 with $3 off but found out other purchase this for around $25/$30. Two stars because they work find when connected to a phone or table but that’s not what I purchased them for.UPDATE REVIEW...This is an update. TOZO Customer service is wonderful they reached out to me to rectify the issue. They issued another TOZO Bluetooth. The previous one works great with my devices just not with my smart tv. Haven’t tried the new one yet but Will keep you posted.  Thanks TOZO\n', ""\n  Every Christmas I usually have enough personal money to make an impulse purchase, usually in Electronics. This year, I wanted to upgrade the $20 pair of totally wireless sound (TWS) earbuds I had. They were good, but needed better sound to make them perfect.With a budget of about $100, I started off looking for something good from a known manufacturer (like Samsung, Jabra, etc.) There was just nothing out there in my price range. I couldn't see myself paying that kind of money from a brand I didn't know, so I started looking for a cheaper model. For around $50 I found 3-4 that looked good and reviews were good enough. I liked Anker's other Bluetooth earphones, so the Soundcore Liberty Lites were considered. With the good reviews and previous good ownership of Monoprice products the Monoprice IPX4s were looking good, too.Due diligence and a desire to be able to use one earbud at a time drive me to search Amazon's best rated under $50 TWS sets, and Tozo looked pretty good. While the buds are labeled L and R, they are both the same, and can be put into either ear. They come with 4 tips, and for the first time, I'm not using the largest ones. So if you have really big ear canals and find it hard to get tips that fit, you may find a good fit here.The sound won't knock Bose out of the water, but for the forty dollars I paid, it is good, and an outstanding upgrade from my $20 pair. It has nice bass, and well defined mids and highs.Battery time is right around 4 hours at low volume (I wear them at work as background noise). The travel case can charge one while the other is playing, so I don't find it hard to get through a work day with them. I like the charging case, too. It's well built, and can use a Qi wireless charger, which I don't care about really. There are 4 lights to tell you how charged it is. it closes and fits in a pocket. I can't tell you how many charges it will take, because I usually keep it plugged in.Pairing, once initially done, is easy. Just pull a bud off the charger and it will turn on and start looking for your paired device. Since I'm using one at a time, I find I need to turn the one I'm using off completely first, then get the other one. I paired them first together, and then separate. This is the best part of these for me, almost seamless use.All in all, very happy with the purchase. And I save up some money to get something else. I have already recommended these to people (my brother is not convinced, he has bone conducting headphones he likes). I do like them that much.\n"", ""\n  \xa0I upgraded from Tozo T8 to the T10 and also own a pair of wireless earbuds from a well known Brand associated with fruit, and have to say I am very impressed with the TOZO T10 in comparison to the other that I own.First of all, They are great value. The set up was very straight forward and connected to my devices bluetooth in a few seconds. When you pick the earbuds up out of the case they automatically attach to each other and have useful light indicators. The case also has light indicators to show the charge level which is very helpful.The waterproof feature is very useful as I'm often worried about headphones if it is raining etc.They fit in my ear nicely and don't fall out as there is a selection of attachment earpiece sizes to best fit the size of your ear.Nice presentation in the box and good clear instructions.The sound is really nice, I have listened to a selection of songs and audiobooks etc and the sound is up there with some of the best sounding earbuds I've used, very clear with good sound range / overall levels and I'd definitely recommend them!The sound range distance is good, I walked downstairs in my home and continued to listen to the headphones no problem (under 10 metres).The case and earbuds feel very premium, there is even a lanyard included for carrying around your neck or hanging on a hook etc.For the price you can't go wrong, also supports wireless charging which I might have to try out as well!I've added an unboxing video plus some photos to help show what's included too.Thanks for reading my review and hopefully this might've helped in your decision to try out these brilliant headphones if you do decide to get these. Happy listening!\n"", ""\n  So I bought these headphones for a single purpose - use in the hot tub (I already use AirPods for running/exercise and some noise-cancelling Bose headphones for when I'm at work)... I have to admit they were a bit of a shot-in-the-dark and I honestly wasn't expecting much from them, especially as I used to have some cheaper headphones for running that were terrible, and really put me off the 'budget' price point.Now these are clearly not AirPod or Bose standard, but frankly for the price they sound excellent. Crystal clear treble and more than enough low-end for me... using my go to track (Wilderness from Clannad's Anam) they have good definition and far exceeded my expectations.They are much larger than AirPods, and you MUST ensure they are correctly positioned (with the right-sized rubber ends on) or the sound quality drops dramatically - but after a few minutes of getting this right (as a one off) they more than meet the requirements. The size isn't really a hinderance to them, because it lets them sit in the ears quite comfortably - but your mileage might vary (with ear size).I haven't had them long enough to gauge battery life, but the wireless charging feature of the case works fine from my standard charging mat.So the TL;DR... really good value for money and surprisingly high sound quality - Recommend!(For full disclosure they cost £29.99 when I bought them and TOZO have offered me an extra wireless charger, no strings attached - but the later has not influenced my review, other than encouraging me to write it).\n"", ""\n  I bought these to take on holiday to Spain, I intended lots of beach and poolside music listening and didn't fancy the wires or bulkiness of my existing headphones. In ear and wire free was a must and having compared many of the headphones on Amazon I ended up choosing these.I wasn't expecting much for the price paid, but first impressions were very positive. The packaging is excellent and suggests premium quality. The charging case is much sturdier than I imagined and the earbuds themselves smaller than I imagined (in a good way).I used the earbuds and charging case daily whilst on holiday for anything from 1-5 hours at a time without any issue. The sound quality is surprisingly very good, a much better bass than I was expecting. Everything seemed nice and clear. I never intended to keep using them daily on my return from holiday, but I have. They are fine when walking too, I expected them to fall out but they don't. I'm not sure I'd trust running in them though.The jury is still out on the long term longevity and battery life a few months down the line, but I'll be happy to revisit this review and update it in a few months if my opinion changes.\n"", '\n  The sound cancellation is really amazing, I couldn’t hear anything else but my music.The quality is good in itself, I had another pair of wireless earphones and it made me unsure if I should buy another pair as the sound quality want good, but these are amazing.They’re easy to use and connected to my phone within seconds, overall really love these\n', '\n  \xa0I have to say these ear buds are great quality both made and for comfort worked straight out of the box and you can even carge the box with a QI wireless charging pad or through the cable it has different size ear buds for comfort and ive included a small video but if your thinking of buying some then just spend a little bit more and buy these because the sound quality is great\n']"

I am not an audiophile by any means.For what these earphones are this is an exceptional deal. I currently own a pair of AirPods which I carry around with me and use quite frequently between work and casual streaming at home on my iPad and iPhone. They work quite well and are easy to use and sound sufficient. But they also cost me $160 when I purchased them.For the couple days I have now owned these earphones I can say that they work quite well and do just about everything the AirPods do. A huge advantage these have over the AirPods is the touch controls in the earphones. They are able to play/pause skip/replay and much more without sacrificng the other options. AirPods give you the choice to reassign which is great but there is no need with these as you can do all of them with different tap combinations.For the price they also sound pretty exceptional. They have rubber tips which help to insulate sound better than what you get with AirPods. The downside to these over AirPods however is that you do have to be concerned about whether or not they will fit your ear. I had a bit of a hard time at first as I am used to the hard plastic earphones Apple has been making for years (Including AirPods). So I am more accustomed to that style. However with a little finesse I have gotten better at putting them in my ears. Plus they come with three different size eartips so you can fit them to your liking. You can see from the photos that these headphones are also quite discrete in the ear. They do not create that large of a profile from the front. The second front facing image I am wearing one the Purity Earphones on the left and a AirPod on the right for comparison.The case they come in is slightly larger than the ones AirPods come in however its not by much. They are definitely still portable and easy to travel with. They also include a small MicroUSB charger to the case with. The earphones themselves are charged inductively through the case. They battery life seems to last pretty well and you can also use each earphone individually so while one is charging in the case you can use the second earphone. They also seem to sync up pretty fast when you go from one to two, or two to one.I highly recommend these to anyone who is a little more money conscious and is still looking for a greatly quality set of fully wireless earphones. There is no need to keep using wired earphones, there are plenty of cheap alternatives to AirPods like this product available in the market.\n', ""\n  Going through these reviews and it looks like people are seriously expecting some $30 wireless earbuds to perform as good as a $200 pair from Apple. Surprise! They won't. They perform as expected of a $30 set and that's why I bought them.Pros:CheapLightweight-ishFancy charging caseBluetooth 5.0Sound is pretty decent for $30 wireless BTCons:Hard to keep them inWill fall out if eating/moving/working outNot a big gripe or anything, but includes the USB to MicroUSB cable, but no charger. Thankfully I have plenty.Not a fan of the highly sensitive one-touch-for-everything button on both buds.Really that's it. They're not life changing. They're not some magical secret Apple destroyers. They're a cheap set of actual wireless earbuds that you can use while sitting at a desk at work or school. Just keep your movements down to a minimum and they'll hopefully stay in.\n"", ""\n  Exactly what I expected it to be: an affordable pair of buds perfect for my daily workouts. Pairing is painless and easy. Interference experienced occasionally, but not often. Battery life is great. Volume is a little soft for my liking, and audio quality isn't great.
