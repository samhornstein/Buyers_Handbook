I didn\'t know what the pricing would be like for the unit and the promise of ""cheap toner"" was definitely interesting. I currently have 4 printers here (2 of which are connected for years now) with one of them being a cheap monochrome single sided laser I bought around 6 years ago now.With my son reaching the age of 4; I have been printing out worksheets for him for the better part of a year now. For him to learn his numbers and letters, practice writing and other things. Therefore I print out a few pages a day on top of what I already print out for my business (contracts and labels).I recently refilled the cartridge on my printer and now the chip is telling me I have 2% ink left... Meaning I will need to buy a new cartridge soon (or find a chip). So I figured that testing out this printer would be great; I would just replace my old printer with this one.So lets get into it; setup is pretty easy. You can use the app to link the printer to your network or do it with a USB cable plugged into your laptop (or Ethernet) and the installer. Since I typically put my printers on Ethernet; this is great thing to have on this printer and definitely a plus over my old printer.Printing pages out was about the same as my old printer... sometimes it actually takes longer to recover from sleep vs my old printer and the print speed isn\'t anything earth shattering (really doesn\'t matter for home use though) when you figure the ""class"" of this printer. Now that ""class"" word is important because here is where things take a turn for the worse.I specifically waited for this printer to go on sale before I publish my review; because the value of an item does weigh into the overall review. Sure this printer is ""fine"" just as most any printer is ""fine"" for printing regular black and white documents. I wanted to see where this printer would land from a pricing standpoint considering that the toner is being marketed as so ""cheap"".I was able to find the toner refill pack at $28 for 2 refills promising 5000 pages of printing which comes out to an earth shattering 0.56 CENTS per page. That is great for someone who prints A TON but pretty irrelevant for the average user.I definitely have a ""heavier printing load"" vs the ""average user"" and while reviewing my printing usage over the past couple years while preparing this review; I noticed that on my Ricoh professional color duplex laser I have only printed 329 pages in the past 2 years. However out of my my old main printer I have printed around 1000 pages in the same time frame (meaning I printed around 1300 pages in 2 years). So thinking about this; a normal cartridge in a regular laser would still last me more than 2 years (as it has, because my last cartridge was purchased in 2016 according to my order history). Therefore this printer wouldn\'t ""save"" me any money really because the cost of the printer is 3x that of similar featured printers and it would take me 10 years to use enough ink to level out the cost.Now there is a ""green"" element to this printer and I think that is the strongest suite of the printer; it is definitely greener than other printers where you would just toss out a cartridge every 1500 pages drum and all (atleast most include a drum also) if you didn\'t take care to recycle them. However you could recycle your used cartridge or even purchase recycled cartridges for other cheaper lasers and spend even less overall on toner than you will with this printer.This is the biggest ""problem"" that I have with this entire concept; the price of the printer is so high that the end user would never save money. If you are the type of user to print 5000-10000 pages a year; then you would have a bigger, faster and more featured printer (probably a color auto duplexing laser as well) with a much larger paper tray (150 sheets is nothing and shows that this is for home / home office use only) because you would likely be printing out lots of documents and not want to reload the paper tray every 1/3 of a ream.This printer is also not devoid of having a cartridge; they have just spun the idea that has already existed for years (to refill your toner cartridge) instead of purchasing a new one. Since the Drum of most modern lasers lasts for 10-20k pages at least there is no reason to replace a drum with only 1500 pages printed on it (as many of the cheap lasers force you to do). So instead you ""refill"" the cartridge yourself with this kit directly through the top of the printer. However the estimated life of the drum is around 20k pages and then you will have to buy one. I cannot find one for sale in the USA however pricing in other countries suggests that the drum is around $62. So this means that the only way this printer is a good value is if you happen to only purchase OEM cartridges and you happen to print a large number of pages but only in small batches (like say 25-50 pages a day) so you wouldn\'t be refilling paper constantly.I also am a bit upset about how HP is classing this printer as an ""upto 20000 page per month duty cycle"" (only found on HP\'s website) which is completely over-inflated. HP\'s own Laserjet Pro MP521DN is only rated for 6000 pages per month and its a professional grade laser printer that costs 3x as much as this (or more) and takes cartridges that cost as much as this printer. It also has an 1100 page capacity option so... how it would it have less than 1/3 the duty cycle of this home printer? Its clear that this model is way overstated just to try to justify its price tag.All in all this printer ""works"" for a home printer but you shouldn\'t buy it unless you fit into a very niche market of printing 25-100 pages a day of basic single sided monochrome sheets. If you print more then a faster printer with a bigger paper capacity would be more suited to you... if you print less (like 1-50 a week) then you should look at a cheaper printer as there are many lasers on the market that are 1/3 or 1/4 of this price with a 1500-2500 page capacity. This would still take you 6 months to 4 years to use a single cartridge and you would have to buy multiple cartridges (at full price and OEM first party cartridges) before you would catch this printers base MSRP. If you purchase recycled cartridges or refill your cartridges then you would never be able to spend as much as the base cost of this printer alone. Making it a horrible value for anyone who isn\'t in the aforementioned niche.If this review helped you (maybe saved you money or made you rethink what you were doing); please mark it helpful! It really took a long time, work and research to put together and I would appreciate your support! Thanks!\n', '\n  I have worked in the IT industry for over 17 years (and even longer as the ""family computer guy"") and have come across a multitude of printers: Canon, Lexmark, Epson, Brother, Konica, HP, Ricoh, and all have their Pros and Cons. One thing is common, however: HP is the most widely used in the business world and for good reasons!Touted by HP as the ""World\'s first cartrige-free laser printer"", the HP Neverstop Multi-Function Laser Printer 1202w is an interesting one that could potentially revolutionize the industry with its eco-friendly footprint, toner ""replacement"" cost, and per-page printing expense.IN A NUTSHELLI am cautiously skeptical. Without having yet printed enough to ""refill"" the toner, I cannot base my opinion on the reliability or quality of this new, ""cartridge-free"" system. The printer comes with enough toner for up to 5,000 pages. With that said, this printer is entirely focused on being environmentally friendly by using less parts and energy wherever possible. This translates to a smaller printer, lower electricity consumption, and the lowest, per-page cost of any HP laser printers in its class. On the flipside, it prints slower at roughly half the speed of the HP M404 series, yet produces sharp, single-sided pages. The toner refill kit fills up the cartridge in less than half a minute, and provides for up to 2,500 pages at just about $15 per toner. That is unheard of!It is a well-made, entry-level, compact, professional-looking printer for the home or small office. Although it can print wirelessly through WiFi, it misses the mark by not providing a wired Ethernet (network) port, an automatic duplex printing option, and automatic document feeder (ADF) for scanning/copying.PROS- Crisp, sharp print quality for text--- Print quality is up to 600 x 600 x 2 dpi- VERY low cost per printed page (about 0.6 cents/page)- Toner reload kit (HP 143A) is only $16 (Two-pack kit, HP 143AD, is $28)--- Seemingly fast, easy, no-mess reload: shake, twist 180 degrees into designated printer slot, and push down like a syringe, all in less than half a minute. I was unable to test this as the kit was unavailable, nor did I print enough for the review to require a refill--- Each reload toner can print up to 2,500 pages--- Printer can hold enough toner for up to 5,000 pages (2 refill kits)--- Toner level indicator at the front (and HP Smart App) lets you know when it\'s time to refill once it reaches the half-way point--- FYI: once the Imaging Drum needs replacement (after roughly 20,000 pages), the HP 144A drum is $71- Good price point- Compact, sturdy, and professional looking--- 18.94"" x 15.35"" x 16.57""--- Light at 19.25 lb (8.73 kg)- Multi-functional printer (MFP): can flatbed scan, copy, and print--- PRINT: up to 21 ppm (not a speed demon)--- SCAN: up to 600 ppi and save as JPG, RAW (BMP), PNG, TIFF, and PDF------ Can scan to supported Cloud services--- COPY: up to 600 x 600 dpi, 99 copies, and 20 cpm- Printing options: WiFi, WiFi Direct (device directly connected to printer), USB 2.0 cable printing, or email--- An email address is provided through the HP Smart App to which you can forward emails to for printing- Can print directly from mobile devices (both Android and Apple iOS) either through the HP Smart App or from other apps that support mobile printing- Easy WiFi configuration by downloading the HP Smart App (Apple iOS/Android/Windows 10)--- HP Smart App effortlessly detected the printer, guiding you through configuration, usage, and provides statistical data--- Windows 10 app through the Microsoft App Store works very well- Email notification of events, such as out-of-paper or toner- Paper Input Tray holds up to 150 sheets- Paper Output Tray holds up to 100 sheets- Print between 4.13"" x 5.85"" and 8.5"" x 14""- Came with USB cable- AirPrint: Apple Mac compatible- Google Cloud Print compatible--- To set up, the printer will waste 2 sheets: one with instructions and another to confirm setup was completed- Configurable, automatic power on/off/sleep modesCONS- Below average graphics print quality- With an entry-level print speed of up to 21 ppm, it is not a speed demon- No wired Ethernet network printing- No automatic Duplex printing (to print on both sides)--- Can manually duplex by feeding the page back to the paper tray- No automatic document feeder (ADF) for scanning and copying- No advanced security features like those found in the business-class, HP M404 seriesTIPS- The software to download for Windows and Mac OS is ""HP Easy Start"" which you can grab from HP\'s website- The software to use on mobile devices (Apple iOS/Android) is ""HP Smart""- You can access the full, complete printer configuration by finding the IP address on the printer (or through the HP apps) and typing it into your web browser- The HP Smart App includes a free trial to Mobile Fax--- Allows you to fax print jobs from the app--- Requires you to have a valid fax number (per regulation), but does not need a phone landline--- I did not check what the service\'s cost is after the 1 month trialOverall, this is an excellent, first attempt by HP to revolutionize its laser printers with a more eco-friendly toner refill approach. This, in turn, translates into per-page cost savings and a smaller, Earth-friendly, carbon footprint. Until HP perfects this new technology, one can only hope that future models will include color printing, automatic duplexing, and automatic document feeding. Great job, HP!\n', ""\n  I know it was probably in the description and I missed it...however, I was shocked that I paid $300 for a printer with no color....it just had to go back. I understand it comes with 5,000 pages but why promote you can print pictures if you can't print in color?\n"", '\n  I like this machine.  That’s the first time I’ve been able to say that about any printer I’ve ever owned!  The printer and app both make me feel confident I can get the job done instead of messing around with dumb gimmicky apps and cleaning print heads.  It just works and the app is user friendly.  I’ll never buy another inkjet printer.  I’ve had all of the brands and they all suck in basically all the same ways.  With the price point of lasers being what they are now,  inkjet printers will hopefully go the way of vacuum tube televisions soon.  That day can’t come soon enough in my opinion.  I own a printer I like.  I can’t believe it!!  Giddy.\n', '\n  Unboxed the printer.Followed instructions.  Easy.  Inserted about 15 sheets of paper into tray.""Out-of-paper"" error ensued.Added more paper ...about 40 sheets.""Out-of-paper"" did not clear.Finally, after 15 minutes of trying to contact HP support (Good luck) the printer decided to print the test page.  Problem is, it grabbed 2 extra sheets.Total POS.Sending back.  Stay away from this.\n', '\n  I like this HP printer very much, but.... for a $330 printer, it lacks two main things that cheaper printers have and they are: 1) a sheet feeder - one must place the sheets one by one by lifting the document cover in order to copy and scan - and 2) it lacks a paper drawer although it does have a cover to the paper slot, which is at best difficult to place.\n', ""\n  For $300 you'd think they'd give you more control over wireless. How about a disable option?\n"", ""\n  Printer never worked.  Bought for my daughter away at school, thought she just didn't know how to set it up but it just spews out toner covered pages.  After not being happy with general performance of a Samsung printer I bought years ago I decided to go back to HP that I have generally loved but really regret purchase.\n"", '\n  With the addition of duplex feature, this product would be unbeatable.\n']"

The company tends to do well in understanding their markets and creating devices accordingly. For example, my studio audio and video production machine is a HP workstation and it has performed admirably for as long as I've owned it. Sadly, I can not say the same thing for the HP Smart Tank Plus 651 Wireless All-in-One Ink Tank Printer. It is simply not a well thought out device that misses the mark in so many areas.The printer has a very small 2.2 inch touchscreen. Even my smartphone has a larger display. Heck, my smart watch has a display almost as large! Plus this is a monochrome (black and white) display. Who installs a black and white displays in a device intended to be sold in the 2020s?There are numerous questionable design decisions as well. For one thing. the paper feed is from the back. There is no paper tray. And the back holds a meager 100 sheets. Who does this in a printer intended for serious SOHO use? Furthermore, the printer as no automatic duplex function. Double sided printing is a totally manual process of printing one side of the page and then flipping the printed paper. HP completely missed the boat here as virtually every competing printer can print duplex automatically.The initial installation was more complex than any other printer that I've owned.  Four bottles of ink have to be carefully poured into the four ink containers in the printer. This isn't a particularly difficult task. However, during the process of pouring the ink bottles into the printer, I got ink on my hands.Of more concern is that the two print heads must be installed by the user. As it is necessary to reach inside of the printer to install the print heads, this becomes a difficult task. The inside is dark and there is very little room to operate making the installation more difficult than necessary. The only upside to this is that it may be possible to for a user to replace a failed print head. However, in all the printers that I've owned and used over the years only one had a print head go bad.After installation there is a fair amount of material that must be thrown away. This includes the four empty ink bottles, several small plastic pieces, one large plastic piece and numerous cardboard and plastic wrapping used to transport the printer. This certainly isn't a printer that is kind to the environment during the installation process.The biggest swing and miss for the HP Smart Tank Plus 651 printer is that it needs an app to be installed (iOS or Android) to manage and to print. Even Windows 10 needs an app installed for printing. There is no other printer that I am aware of that can't be accessed for printing directly from Windows 10 without an app. Plus the printer requires Wi-Fi access in order for the app to work--even if your PC or laptop is wired to an Ethernet network.HP clearly needs to go back to the drawing board with the HP Smart Tank Plus 651 printer. They need to see how Brother, Canon, Epson and other manufacturers have designed their printers. Because as it stands now, the HP Smart Tank Plus 651 printer will not see any use in my studio and home office.\n"", ""\n  I am completely thrilled with my new printer. I have been on the search for a great printer that doesn't use so much ink. I heard about these new Smart Tank printers and bought one. Fail. I tried again with this new HP Smart Tank Plus 651 Wireless All-in-One. Drop the mic, this printer is all that and more. It prints with a crisp clarity that I love. My business brochures are finally top notch. The vivid colors really make my documents stand out.The best part about this HP Smart Tank Plus 651 Wireless All-in-One Printer is how easy it is to set up. It took me under 5 minutes from unboxing to printing. It walks you through all with clear instructions and an app. The app is another great feature. When you're on the go like me, all business needs must be constantly accessible. This smart app allows for that. While the upfront price was a bit more than my last printer, I will easily make up for it in the first 6 months.I definitely recommend this printer to anyone looking for a durable, efficient, and economic printer.\n"", '\n  Absolutely HORRIBLEPaid almost 450 dollars for this thing with the insurance.It was doing okay, got theough 4 pages jammed once. Did okay for about 11 more pages and jammed again. Now it repeatedly jams it started not taking papaer but still acting like its printing and ink is now all inside the printer.... I got this becuase of HPs ink quality but my canon NEVER jamed. The ink just is not that gerat for photo printing. I dont know if this is just a bad one but its going back and i will just deal with low ink quality from my canon mega tank\n', '\n  *update* there is a real issue with the printer getting caught in a loop and freezing with that ever present ""loading circle"" issue. The only way, each time, to resolve the issue was to unplug it and restart the entire print. Though the amount saved with ink has led me to put up with it. It happened a lot originally, and now rarely...and it started after the return period had ended...HP might have had an update fix. Just beware. *At first sight, this printer looks too good to be true. The first thing that got me was the ink tanks located at the front of the printer. You can see how much ink you physically have left?? Brilliant. The thought of refilling my ink cartridges with full bottles of ink instead of having to go out to spend $80 on new cartridges that I can\'t know without a doubt is full...it\'s so satisfying. I feel whole.My only concern was in the very beginning with one minor (and I emphasize minor) issue with the printing quality. Several pages into our first couple days of printing we had some pretty heavy black ink streaking all down the pages. Had it been an important document, I\'d be more upset. Fortunately, it wasn\'t but I do wonder how much of that ink was wasted. I\'m rather frugal in that department. No bleeding since then, and the issue has resolved itself without having to call any customer support or do any heavy lifting. VOILA. Don\'t you love that??Aside from that, I\'ve had no issues. The cloud printing setup with various servers was effortless, as was connecting to the wifi network and my laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The whole family is using this big guy, and we\'re pretty happy with it.\n', '\n  priceyif it lasts cost of ink should repay me\n', '\n  excellent\n']"

I did not want this and if you look closer, there is an option to opt out and complete the set-up. I am still on the fence about signing up for the ink deliveries but I do very little printing. There are various options for ink delivery, all based on the number of sheets you print.  The 4 print cartridges were puzzling at first (they have a plastic tab that you break off). After struggling a bit, I realized that a pretty helpful demonstration shows you how to insert them on the display screen on the front of the printer. Printing is fast and the quality is superb.

I downloaded the HP Smart app on my phone which gave me the ability to print on the go. How awesome is that and it doesn't take a rocket scientist! The printer is very well built, and is of quality, especially for a reasonably priced printer. This OfficeJet has done everything I've asked of it and has done it well.

I am very disappointed in HP's slip shod conduct.\n"", '\n  I\'ll start with the positive which is that this is a really elegant looking printer which seems well built in terms of the hardware. The negative is that the software is riddled with bugs, the set up process was clunky at best, the scan quality is worse than my 10 year old Brother and the quality of support from HP must surely be an embarrassment to the company.And now for the scam. This version cost me about $60 more because it claims to include ""8 months of free ink"" which is the marketing hook that got me. It sounds like good deal. Unfortunately this statement would be illegal in some countries because it\'s far far from true. What they includes is a very small discount on the condition that you sign up on a long term account to an overpriced ink delivery service. I did the calculations and the economics certainly do not stack up.If you are determined to buy an HP I suggest spending less on something like the 8025 and putting the difference towards ink cartridges, because believe me they will need replacing soon after you get the printer. The cartridges that came with the 8035 needed replacing after only 62 pages (with no colour photos or anything) according the printer\'s own counter.\n', ""\n  So the printer arrived quickly thanks to Prime 1 day delivery. Unpacking and set up was a breeze (pic 1)A few tips:1/  to install the ink jets, remove the white plastic tab (pic 2) and before lifting the cartridge door, make sure the scanner lid is lowered! Otherwise, the cartridge door will remain locked.2/ the wifi setup was automatic for me. I just downloaded the app on my laptop via 123.hp.com which directed me to the Windows store. After install, I gave permissions to the printer when asked if it could access my WIFI settings and voila!3/ to put in the papers, I used the HP 8.5 x 11 ultra-white, make sure to 1st remove the taped small cardboard piece (pic 3).4/ Do not skip the alignment adjustments step. Simply press ok and the printer will print the alignment page (see pic4). Then flip it face down and put it on the corner where the white arrow is (the printer will show you a visual guide anyways).5/ Firmware was updated automatically the 1st time I turned off the printer.First Impressions: Well it's only been a few hours and I've printed in both color and black and white. Text and images are crisp. Ink is not wet.The printer looks great. Love the design and red, white and black patterns.Maybe it was due to the firmware update but the printer did purr for about a minute when I was not printing anything. I subsequently printed a few pages and all seems well.Will update this review in a month after using the scanner and copy features as well.\n""]"

I've owned 4 HP multi-function printers over the last 5 years from 3 different generations, and have been very happy overall.  The installation is generally fast and painless and the printers have been reliable.  When I tried to order another one of the same generation I've been using, I found it out of stock on Amazon so decided to try the newer 9015.  Big mistake.  It's been a disaster from the beginning.

The price point is surprisingly affordable in a field of many printers that claim to offer huge quality at a reasonable price. When I received the printer I was immediately worried that it was going to be way too big to fit into my designated printer space in my home office. Upon opening, I was pleasantly surprised at the set up and how compact it really is for such an extensive machine. Upon unboxing, I followed the set up guide and it was a breeze. Anyone with basic knowledge of a computer could have this set up and put to work in 20 minutes. The bulk of my printing falls into 2 categories- school work and crafting. For school work, a simple color printer gets the job done for producing nice documents and occasional image printing. For crafting, I need a higher quality image, accurate CMYK/color matching, and a high dpi for crisp output. I also require that it can handle sublimation ink for my heat transfer crafts. Well, folks, I am here to tell you that the OfficeJet Pro 9025 delivers all of that and more. After a quick set up and connecting to my computer wirelessly, I did a couple of test prints (see pictures). The color match was spot on. The images were crisp and clear, giving me a photo that was frame-worthy. I would feel as confident printing my personal pictures and crafting images as I would mass printing professional looking flyers for work. I also need to not that the printer is not loud. That's a small peeve, but something that will make me write off a printer. I dont want to hear the screeches or beeps, feel my desk shake as it prints, etc. This printer is quiet, fast, and really performs. Another plus is that it is InstantInk ready. Who hasn't gone to print and realized their cartridge is at the end of its lifespan?! This printer will communicate with InstantInk and based on your chosen subscription, will order your refills as needed! Don't forget that aside from printing, this is a scanner, copier, and fax. It maintains image integrity and produces a fantastic duplication of your documents via copy and scan. There isn't really an area of expertise that this printer doesn't hit the ball out of the park. This is a solid 10/10, highly recommend. It is a behemoth worthy of business use that is just as great for home office use. The price is on point and the quality far exceeds expectations!\xa0\n"", ""\n  This is my second HP all in one wireless printer that allows you to connect using their  HP Smart app to do a plethora of printing.I had to admit this is bigger than I thought it would be, but that is my own person 'duh' because it is designed for small business and not just a personal printer.  It has two trays that together can hold an entire ream of paper.It has a digital screen panel control that help accomplish tasks anywhere from the initial set up to scanning, printing and making cool brochures.You can connect via wifi using your router network, a connection to the computer with its own direct connection, USb or bluetooth.I have it connected to my wifi router.  And , as was true with my other HP wireless printer, this caused some small issues with maintaining connectivity.  It might just be the way my ISP and router is set, but I had to go in an give the printer a static IP address because some of the devices in my house (we have 4 computers, 4 phones and a tablet) had trouble discovering the printer based on the home network name, but easily found it based on the IP address.  If the IP address changed (which they do in this case because of the way DHCP leases are set up in my home router) then those devices sometimes thought the printer was not online.It is fast, the print is crisp and clean and I love using the app to print documents from anywhere.One other thing to mention, the initial set up takes you through a lot of the HP marketing stuff which can be declined.  One that seems really attractive is the Instant Ink program.  This is a great option, initally, as you can get ink replacement at a deep discount.  You set up your account through HP, set up how much ink you think you'll use in a month (this can be adjusted later if you find you use less or more), this will be used to set a recurring, monthly charge from your credit card/bank account.  HP can tell when you are getting low on ink and will automatically send you ink before you run out.  As mentioned this is offered at a pretty nice discount over buying replacement cartridges in a store.  It is a great option if you plan on using and keeping this printer for any length of time.  One caveat, if you replace the printer or cancel your instant ink enrollment, the instant ink cartridges will no longer work in your printer as of your effective cancel date.  Even if they are already installed in the printer, even if you have some stock piled ready to be installed, yes even the ones already paid for.

I went through all the basics name, language etc.  Then after getting to my WiFi it prompted me for my PSK (what’s that) or to try the WPS method which didn’t work.  The only way to get it to work was to go to the Canon Business Print app, not the Canon Print App. Unfortunately neither the manual nor anything I found on line told me to take that step. It doesn’t feel very solid and I wonder how long it will last. The screen is not only very small but I have to shine a flashlight on it to read it.

Nothing had changed. It was still visible on the network. I could ping it. But no errors, just non-responsive. ""Ready to print"" didn\'t mean it would actually print.I ultimately managed to print one document. Today, I tried to print something else. It will not. ""Broken Pipe"".Buyer beware.\n', '\n  \xa0I love tech and doing reviews when I get something so people can make a better decision before buying products. I have a YouTube and Facebook channel called ""OndaWire"" where I do all types of tech reviews. I test products out for a couple of weeks and then give (from my experience using the product) my pros and cons. I had this printer for close to a month now and really wanted to test it before reviewing so now let\'s jump right in and talk about this Canon LBP113w Laser Printer. ***MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS OF INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE BEFORE CONNECTING THE USB CABLE***Pros:1. WOW! This printer is surprisingly small. From the pictures, you would think that it\'s huge but it\'s not. The width of this printer is smaller than the width of my 16"" laptop. The measurements are 14.8"" wide, 11.5"" from front to back, 8.8"" tall and it\'s very lightweight at just 12 lbs with two grips on the sides bottoms to easily carry it. This printer sits right on my desk and is not in the way at all. I have to say that I was surprised by how compact this printer is. Even when I got the printer in the mail, I thought it was big, but again, it\'s not.2. The set up is super easy. It comes with a CD in case you need drivers and the sort. It is a super easy walkthrough process. I added a quick video from when I first turned it on and it goes through its setup.3. This printer works with a USB cable or 100% wireless. YES! I do everything wireless so this is perfect for me.4. The print quality is super crisp. Again it\'s black and white only and I have not experienced any smears or anything else, just good quality documents.5. This has IPv4 for older devices and IPv6 for newer devices. I use a mesh system and I keep everything on IPv6 because I like the added security and my older printer would only allow IPv4. This is my new go-to printer.6. LASER Printers beat ink, ink-jet printers all day. I say that because with ink printers, even when you are not using the printer the ink cartridges still dry out. Toner cartridges for Laser printers DO NOT! A laser printer may cost a bit more upfront, but you will save a lot of money in the long run.7. This has to covers that come with the printer. One cover is for the paper tray to help prevent spilling something on the paper and to prevent dust. The other cover is for the top for (what I assume) the same thing. I am also able to lay lightweight items on top of the printer with this top cover as well.8. This printer has AirPrint and Google Cloud Print. These two features are so cool because you can print straight from your iPhone and your Google account. That was super cool. It also has WiFi direct connect.9. The paper tray will hold up to 150 sheets of paper and the description says that it prints 23 pages a minute. When I ran a print test, I got 23 pages in right about 53 seconds. This beat the description so that is always a BIG PLUS!10. It comes with the toner cartridge and drum already included (it already installed in the printer) which is a plus as well.11. This printer can also use different size sheets of paper which is a plus.12. Lastly, I love the auto-sleep mode this has. When you are done and not using it for awhile, it will activate sleep mode and save on energy consumption. That is good so you don\'t have to power it off when done.Cons:1. This is not a big con at all, but over the month that I\'ve been using this, the only thing that I noticed is that when it is in sleep mode, it doesn\'t wake right up. I found the best solution is to walk up to it and hit a button and it wakes right up and then I print. Trying to print directly from my phone sometimes would take a few seconds but nothing to complain about. That is the only thing I can say for the cons.I am undoubtedly giving this Canon LBP113w Laser Printer a 5 ***** star rating. I saw a couple of reviews that said they were disappointed because this doesn\'t print in color or scan or copy. That confused me because it clearly states in the description that this Canon LBP113w Laser Printer is a Black and White Laser Printer only. If people ""thought"" this was a color printer that copied and scanned, then that is their fault, not Canon\'s.I absolutely love this printer and probably use it to print about 30 - 50 pages a week. Over the month that I had it, I have had no issues, so far. I would highly recommend this Canon LBP113w Laser Printer if you are only looking for a black and white printer and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND a Laser printer over ink printer any day of the week and year.\n', ""\n  When I first got this printer I was nervous about the setup due to other reviews, but tips I've garnered from them helped the process. Just like another reviewer said, in order to print from the phone you also need to download the Canon Business Print app *as well as* the Canon print service app. The Canon print service app will not allow you to print from it directly, it just allows the Business print app to work.  Secondly, you do need to download the software on the disk before attempting to print via USB. So far we have not been able to directly print from our computer via wifi, I'm not sure what the problem may be or if we are just not doing something, but I'll leave an updated review if I find out. Ether way, so far so good for a monochrome laser printer at this pice! We had gotten an Hp before and it broke pretty soon after purchase so I'm just happy to have a printer again!\n"", ""\n  I've had this thing for 2 weeks. I hate it. 1. Paper jams whenever I ateempt to print anything more than 15 pages. 2. LED display panel looks like something from 1994 - difficult to read and no backlight. 3. WiFi set-up was very frustrating. In fact I gave up after 90 mins and simply attached a USB cable from the back of the printer to my laptop. 4. No USB cable is included in the box.  5. Comes with a lid that doesn't attach to the printer - it simply sits on top - I was expecting it to SNAP ON.  5. Instruction manual that is awkwardly written. It's 2021 - why is a printer of this type $100? There are better laser printers at this price. Ugh.\n"", '\n  Print Quality:Average, as every other printer does.Easy to install:Not at all, there is no specification no nothing. If you buy it from local store, someone from store will help you setup everything. Doing manually is tough job even after being a software engineer.Wifi signal:Honestly, I gave up setting it up in between and never reach to that level. Still, i am pretty sure it will not be the easy job.Review:Bought it before a month and it was not working due to some sensor error. Technician put a piece of paper on sensors connectors and make it work again. But, that’s not the way you fix something.So, if you are looking for some printer. Buy it from local store and check they after sell services properly. Else, you will end up like this piece of PAPER. 😐\n', '\n  Product is good but printing fully unsatisfied.

It is very light weight and closes up very securely and packs away nicely and opens quickly and ready to go.\n', '\n  So far so good (two weeks of use).  The downloaded software did not allow my Win 10 computer to recognize the printer when hooked into my computer\'s USB 2.0 connection.  But Win10 ""Add Printer/Device"" function did see it - and has a little tab once recognized that say ""Get App.""  I believe this allowed it ti find and install the printer driver that has the utility program for the printer.Prints fast.  Don\'t expect high color content on a mobile printer though.  But it was nice to be able to fit it into my cabinet, which had an 10.75"" shelf depth.\n', '\n  i have been using it for a few weeks.  not so much as a mobile printer but plugged in as a home office printer.  it works well.  i did not need an all-in-one printer with fax and scan and so on which seems to be all you can find these days.  instead i wanted something with a small footprint and this one is small enough but not tiny like the canon ip110 or the epson wf100.  i decided against the epson because there is a tray or something that needs to be replaced on top of the ink, i dont like the extra cost.  the canon was close but in the end the hp was cheaper, and i think replacement inks are also cheaper, and it can use a bigger ink tank (less changing inks) and it prints just a hair faster than the canon i think.  i was able to set up using only windows 7 driver, which is great coz the main computer is locked for software installations.  i remember my other canon printer only worked with the canon software installed.  very happy with this printer where i just need somethign small to print documents.\n', ""\n  Two days to get this to connect to my network and still no joy HP SMART APP is useless. I would not recommend this printer or HP for such a painful experiencePrinter says failed to connect but printout test results page says Congratulations on successful setup but it isn't connected. USELESSWith further work on trying to get this to connect I managed for 30 minutes to get this to connect after I reserved the IP address. However while I once got this to reconnect after it goes to sleep 20-30 minutes it doesn't register on the network anymore and isn't able to reconnect. Turn off and on again did reestablish twice in a row then if I was unable to see it in the network itself - I thought I'd solved it but sadly not.. The antenna is also very too week  only two areas approximately 10 feet from the router were good enough to make the above connection. My router has a strong signal but this printer says excellent signal until I moved it only 1 foot further away.  I could solve all this if only Apple was still making the Airport Express. but if mine AE ever dies I'd be stuck with a poorly designed printer.My Advice DON'T buy this if you indent to network this printer at home without ANY wires. I'm sure it will work if you wire this to your machine or router and network that way, negating useless signal. this product has.I intend to returning this as its not as advertised.\n"", '\n  I just purchased this printer after trying and hating the Epson Workforce 100 I wasn’t expecting much but I love, it’s 100 times better the the Epson printer in that you don’t have to print everything through the app. Half the time the Epson wouldn’t print but so far this printer has been prefect and printed everything I needed it to. Plus you can plug it directly into the computer if needed rather then printing off wifi. I needed something small and portable for out main floor office and this little machine is awesome!\n', '\n  Me gustó mucho porque tiene buena calidad de impresión, dentro de lo que cabe se le puede llamar portátil porque cabe en una mochila. No le doy las 5 estrellas porque no ha sido fácil encontrar cartuchos de tinta de repuesto, ni siquiera en la misma página de HP. Solamente hay aquí mismo en Amazon, pero no se si el precio es el correcto porque no hay en dónde mas comparar.\n', '\n  Muy buena calidad.  Recomiendo agregar a la compra un cartucho detinta adicional pirque la que trae dura muy poquito.  Legó incluso antes de lo esperado\n']"
