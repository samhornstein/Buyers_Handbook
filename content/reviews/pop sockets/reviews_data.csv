I specifically bought this because it said it works with wireless charging.  No it does not and I don't see how it can.  As for the actual product it's it is fine.  I'm just upset about the fact that no wireless charging can be done.  There's to much of a gap caused by this. So I don't know what else to say.  They have to come up with some way to make the back completely smooth and removable and besides velcro or something I don't see how. But my main complaint is wireless charging is false in my opinion.  I have 2 different chargers and neither 1 will work with this on. So mission failed\n"", ""\n  Pretty sure I got a knockoff or the wrong model. Wasn't aluminum, not removable or interchangeable, smaller and felt different than every other pop socket I've owned.

I'd planned on using a strong glue after reading some of the reviews about it's poor adhesive but judging by a few weeks use it seems like that won't even be an issue.  The base (part stuck to the phone) is fixed while the rest spins 360 degrees so the phone can rotate between your fingers to the most comfortable position.  I'd be willing to bet this is an underrated feature on what would otherwise be a simple device but it wouldn't be the same without it, definately improves the overall feel.I've never used other pop sockets for comparison but I feel like they could have made this a little better, it feels slightly cheap to the touch, yet still durable enough that I don't worry about breaking it.  Good but could be made better.  Whether I'm working on a roof or in the backseat of a work truck bouncing all over the place, this has been a tremendous helping me to steadying my phone.  Along with a hard case and protective screen this is a must have if you use a smart phone out and about.\n"", '\n  I ordered the ‘PopGrip with Swappable Top for Phones & Tablets - Aluminum Black’. The package labelled this as the pop socket “PREMIUM” on the package. I usually buy the pop socket premium in stores and couldn’t find that wording on Amazon’s product name listings for Pop Socket so I thought I’d mention it here. I love this specific pop socket and they were out in my store so I ordered it here and it was the same. The premium ones have a quality to them than the printed pattern regular pop sockets and are less bulky than the luxe pop sockets in my opinion. I highly recommend this one! I bought a new one because I got a new case but the previous one has been on my case for 2+ years and still sticking. I will say that if you like spinning your phone on tabletops like I do, it will wear off the top layer and start to show the silver inside so be careful with that impulse :)\n', '\n  I’ve been using this popsocket for a few months now and it STILL is sticking on my phone with the original adhesive. I’m blown away by how well this works. It’s not compatible for wireless charging but that’s not a huge inconvenience to me.

My other Popsocket lasted almost THREE YEARS! This one 3 MONTHS!  It has never gotten wet.  Well actually I must prop it and not hold due to Guillian Barre Syndrome.  So holding phone for extended time is not an option.  I pull it out and rest it on a pillow in my lap!  That is NOT being excessive with any pressure on it.  So actually only got 2 months worth out of it as tp holding to use it!  And paid $15!!  What a waste!  The rest of the pop socket is solid, the top and rubber, the base is sturdy and is stamped POPSOCKET.  But the adhesive certainly is not like what they used to be!!  It is just peeling off!  Extremely disappointed and disgusted.  The case is the same type I had from my last Popsocket.  Now unsure what to try!!\n', ""\n  Even mentioned in the description, this one does not work with wireless charging at all, DON'T BUY IT!!!\n"", ""\n  I change my case often, and always get a pop socket to match.

I have small hands and sometimes couldn’t operate my phone without dropping it!  This has made it so much easier and I use it all the time. It has stuck fast since the day I put it on.

Just some advise to any newbies- don’t fall for off brands because they’re usually flimsy crap, make sure they’re legit popsockets.  There’s a very specific way to apply these.  I personally use wiki how and have never had any trouble getting them to stick.  Don’t let the sticky part of the popsocket be exposed to the air longer than 15 minutes otherwise it will lose its stickiness.  If you apply it right you should get over 100 applications.

I like that its matte not shinny because it matches my case nicer. This is my first one so I was surprised at how strong it sticks and wish I had moved it up a little but that's my fault.

Heck if I know, but I'm very excited it's a product that just works.) I needed a new one when I upgraded phones and chose this one. The product quality is wonderful.

I love that I can even use it as a phone prop on a smooth surface if needed. Thanks for making such a functional and cool product!\n"", '\n  Should have peeked at the reviews before ordering as I also thought this would be shiny. My last popsocket was shiny and textured.

I was expecting it to be holographic or at least a gloss finish.\n', '\n  Having prepared this pop socket as instructed it does not and has not managed to stick to my phone case.

The glue part separated so that there was residual glue stuff on the case and the popsocket portion came off with no glue left on it. Once this happens there is no way to get good adhesion again - you can try pushing it on to secure but it will never prove a good hold. I’ve had to use hot glue or a glue gun to get a sturdy enough adhesion to make it useable again. This is on a flat case that should have no problem mainTraining a secure hold.
