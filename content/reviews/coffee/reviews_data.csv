But after I had my first sip of the Johnson House Blend flavor, I was never the same. Now I’m no coffee aficionado, but I can absolutely say I tasted the difference between this coffee and the regular local grocery store bought coffees I usually get. I would absolutely recommend giving this a try, I know you won’t be disappointed. I’m currently on my bag of Ethiopia Gotiti Natural bag of coffee and I’m absolutely loving it too. I definitely plan on resubscribing in the very near future!\n', ""\n  Sent this as a gift to my grandson and he hasn't stopped talking about how great the coffee is!

Highly recommended.\n', '\n  We are HUGE Coffee drinkers and decided to give this a try. We were not impressed and cancelled the subscription.

It's always a nice surprise to see what each shipment will bring.\n"", '\n  Good coffee but to expensive for what you get\n', '\n  I subscribed for 6 months. Out of the 6 bags of coffee I received, I only really enjoyed one of them, which was a Brazilian dark roast with low acidity and some lovely aromas. The most of the coffee beans I received were light/medium roast with high acidity—tons of cream and sugar couldn’t even mask the awful flavor. The 3 bags that are unfinished are going into the compost pile.\n', ""\n  When I started grinding my own beans, I was blown away by how much better my coffee tasted.  Now that I've tasted freshly roasted beans, it's like coffee has reached a new level for me.  I love this coffee subscription.  For a long time, I was devoted to Starbucks' Kenyan and Yukon whole bean coffees.  Not only do Bean Box's freshly roasted coffees beat out anything Starbucks has on offer, it's so nice to experience variety.  And great too that I can go on Bean Box's website and order a bag of a particular roast I enjoyed in my subscription.  The price may seem high to some, but if you have a discerning coffee palate, I think you'll find that you're getting what you pay for.  I highly recommend this subscription.  One bag per month is perfect for a single gal like me, but others in a 2+ person household which drinks coffee daily will find that they go through a single bag quickly.  If you're part of a larger household, I recommend going on the Bean Box website and looking at all the various subscription options.\n"", '\n  This started as a simple, few months trial, gift to my son and his wife. It sounded ideal for the coffee snobs they’ve become. And so it proved.I’ve tried several times to get them to admit it’s just coffee so I could cancel the subscription. (Very pricey coffee, did I mention?)But they almost grovel, dropping compliments about how much they enjoy, how they anticipate the next delivery. Sigh.So I’ve ordered a subscription for the light roast bean box as well. It’s only money.\n']"

I counted the K-Cups and found I had only received 47 in one box and 49 in another.  The last box had a correct count in it.  Just beware.  Amazon was wonderful about resolving the problem, but you may want to count your K-Cups, just in case.  I pray future boxes will contain the correct count!\n"", '\n  Received these in a cardboard box with all the expiration dates rubbed off. I will be returning these immediately. Very disappointed.\n', '\n  I opened the box today and there was only a half a box so I counted the pods.  The box only contains 48 pods!!!  It is supposed to contain 84 pods so I am 36 pods short!!!!!  I’d like to believe this wasn’t intentional.  If you expect any repeat orders from me,  someone needs to send the other 36 pods that I am due!!!!!\n', '\n  Tellement bon\n', '\n  This coffee is not strong enough for my taste.\n', '\n  très satisfaite.\n', '\n  FAST SHIPPING AND I AM SO HAPPY TO HAVE MY FAVORITE COFFEE FOR MY KEURIG 2.0\n']"
