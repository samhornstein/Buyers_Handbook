I bought one from Best Buy on Black Friday and compared, and there are minute details that are off with the touch pad and the directional pad. Additionally, the serial number label on the back of the controller is different than the other controllers I have (two I bought from Best Buy a couple days ago). I recommend buying from the store...these are not the wave!\n"", ""\n  For some reason these controllers from Amazon just aren't the same as the ones from wal-mart. They're lighter, the analog sticks are so loose, no stiffness at all, they just flop around, and they all die on me within a few months. There must be different manufacturers involved here.EDIT; By die I mean they quit holding a charge for more than like 30 minutes. I have a wal-mart one that I bought when my PS4 that is a year and a half old and it's analog sticks are still nice and stiff, it still holds a 5+ hour charge, meanwhile I've gone through four of these and have no intention of ever buying another one.\n"", ""\n  Bought this as a backup for my original PS4 controller which is still working just fine.  Used lightly for about 30 hours of game play and the problem started.  The left thumb stick does not appear to any longer be returning to center/neutral making it impossible to correctly interact with games as you are unwillingly moved in different directions and are unable to stay still.  Resetting the controller did not correct the issue.  Realize that I am out of the return window so I just bit the bullet and bought another $42 replacement.  I don't think that it is unrealistic to expect the controller to work longer than it did.  Very disappointed.  Keeping my fingers crossed for the new one that just arrive.\n"", ""\n  The left analog stick always wears out. You may not notice right away because it doesn't show in all games. In games where the left stick movement is very sensitive, certain directions will cause the character to shuffle their feet repeatedly because the controller's signal constantly shows a strong/weak press alternating. My first controller, this issue was when pressing around 1 o' clock on the analog, the second one is when I press straight to the left.I've never had so many problems with a game system's controller. Even my 360 controllers which have stick drift don't become as unplayable as these ps4 controllers do.\n"", '\n  I have gone through two Dualshock 4 new model controllers, one that came with my PS4 Pro and a second one I ordered a month later when the first one developed issues with the left analog stick. Now my second controller is showing the exact same issues.The symptoms are that at some specific angle, in my case at the very least slightly to the left or right of straight forward, the stick will not respond properly. This will result in the game character for instance suddenly slowing to a walk from a run and back again, resulting in very stuttery movement. And over time the issue will get worse, with larger deadzones.Sony will replace the controllers under warranty within one year, but the warranty process is inconvenient to say the least. You have to mail the controller to them, and you might not get it back for two or three weeks. Without a controller, the Playstation system is unuseable. There are several guides out there that detail how to replace the sticks yourself, but they require cracking the controller open and desoldering the stick to solder a new one in its place.When the stick is behaving normally the controller is great, but with two in a row going bad like this I will be looking into a third party controller for sure.\n', ""\n  I was so excited to get this remote because of the color. It went with Spiderman and Red Dead Redemption 2. However,  it has been a little over 1 month and the controller is starting to act faulty. With a full time job and college courses, I havent had much time to play, so it's not abuse on my part. The controller keeps shifting to the left even when my hands are off the controller. This happens during gameplay and during the initial playstation screen menu. I've turned the controller off and on, restarted the playstation, connected the USB cable to see if there is a difference and no matter what it seems to shift to the left. I dont have the same problem with my original controller so it's definitely an issue with this controller. It's very disappointing.\n"", '\n  I first encountered the DualShock 4 controller when I was playing on my PS4 and it was great.Lightweight, great response time, love the LEDs that change colors , touchpad is also good and triggers are responsive enough for feedback.Now I switched back to PC gaming and this is great. I\'m running it with ""DS4Windows"" which is a 3rd party app to make the DS4 controller work on Windows. It\'s great! you can use it either wired or wireless and charge from PC with the micro-usb cable it comes with.I played WWE 2k18, NBA2k18, COD: WWII, and South Park with it. So far- great! Highly recommend if you use controllers for PC gaming.\n', ""\n  Bought a brand new controller. Opened it up upon receipt and pressed the on button, no charge didn't turn on. Plugged it into three different USB cables connected to the outlet, ps4, and macbook and no charge. Connected it to a docking stage, still would not charge or turn on. All of these methods worked with my old controller. Very disappointed. This seller is distributing defective goods and looking at the reviews this is n't the first time it's happened. Do not buy from this seller, instead go to GameStop or elsewhere and buy a controller from them.\n"", '\n  El producto llegó en buenas condiciones y en la fecha indicada por amazon.Antes de confirmar la compra tenía dudas de este control (PS4) de que resultará genérico, por lo tanto realice la comparación con el control que incluye con la ( PS4 ) sin encontrar ningún indicio de que resultará genérico, lo utilizo  frecuentemente sin problema alguno ya que con el uso que a tenido no ha presentado problemas de comunicación, batería y controladores.Saludos, gracias por leer mi reseña espero te sirva de buena referencia\n', '\n  He recibido el paquete hoy, no puedo dar mas de una estrella aun sin probar el funcionamiento por una simple y sencilla razon, por segunda ocasion me llego el control con los sellos originales de SONY violados, es decir como si la caja original huniese sido abierta previamente por alguna razon la primera ocasion solicite el reemplazo porque incluso venia ""resellado"" con cinta diurex mal cortada, en esta 2da ocasion no traia la cinta diurex pero los sellos estaban cortados nuevamente, lo cual para ser vendido directamente por amazon México me parece decepcionante pues esto no me parece normal ni correcto, he decidido quedarme con el producto pues quiero pensar y confiar en que es origibal y que me respetaran la garantía del mismo pero definitivamente deberia ser una llamada de atencion el que tengan este problema con un producto\n', '\n  Infelizmente o produto não é original, fiz um teste com um original e suas reações no computador.Até então eu não me importaria se pelo menos funcionasse igual o original, porém a parte do touch fica mandando comandos como se estivesse sendo tocado sozinho.Não comprem !\n', ""\n  I absolutely loved the colour of this controller - hence why I bought it for my boyfriend 😂 it's really sturdy, delivery was super fast...there's not much more to say really :)\n"", '\n  Absolutely love the colour,arrived very quick and at a very decent price I am happy and great seller thanks\n']"

It's been months since I've purchased this control and it STILL works perfectly. Best purchase I've made.WOW 5 OUT OF 5 STARS!!!!I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CONTROLLER. I hardly write a review unless something is really good.And this controller is excellent.Pros: The Xbox style controller makes this ps4 controller the best I've had.The D pad is the round one piece kind that makes fighting game inputs much much easier.The colorful face buttons light up and look amazing.Headset can be turned on and off remotely without the menu.Battery is great. I could easily get 10 to 12 hours.Cons: I didn't get this controller sooner.\n"", ""\n  Out of all the 3rd party controllers i've tried, the Pictek probably stands at the number one spot for a budget controller.The Horipad F.P.S. stands in second place due to the cheap feel and lack of mic port. I've tried countless others but, they are very unreliable for me because I play a lot of F.P.S. games. With the massive amount of shooters I play, I always have to compensate for 3rd party controllers by adjusting deadzones and sensitivity to feel more like a dualshock 4 in terms of accuracy, but they never succeed. The controller has the same feel of the xbox 360, but is sturdier and might take more a beating. The thumbsticks are more resistive compared to the dualshock 4, but are just as accurate given time. Not a fan of the control pad, but inputs come out faster in fighters due to the shape if it. Triggers are perfect for racers and shooters. Not much input delay except when you intially connect it for the first 10 seconds. Turbo is an added bonus, but I don't use it personally. Horipad F.P.S. Plus beats it in terms of accuracy and target aquisition speed for shooters, but Pictek definitely has more functionality. Will use the Pictek and Horipad any day over the dualshock 4, because they cost less and feel more comfortable than the dualshock.\n"", ""\n  When I ordered this controller it was mainly because it reminds me of the XBOX controller. A controller I've been in love with since forever. The Playstation controller just doesn't do it for me, but I've made due. To be honest, I NEVER considered grabbing another controller for my PS4 until I laid my eyes on this one.This controller is just the right size for me since I have large hands. It's comfy in my hands. It just feels good to play with. The turbo button is a nice addition if you're into that. I used it once or twice. It really doesn't make too much of a difference, but it's cool to have the option. It'll certainly make shooting with semi automatic rifles in a FPS interesting. The buttons light up too. That's pretty dope.I have only ONE gripe with the controller, but it's definitely not worth taking away a star from the rating. When I plug my Elgato chat link into the headphone jack, it's not as snug as I'd like. I have to constantly wiggle it around. However, any other headphones I plug into the controller works just fine. No big deal. Whenever I'm recording game play, I have to use the PS4 controller.Over all, it's definitely worth the money of not more. Don't tell them. I said that though.\n"", ""\n  **Second Edit**I received the replacement controller and it was able to be hooked up right out of the box without any issues. I’ve used it for a few hours at this point and I love how comfortable the controller feels in my hands. Buttons are responsive and overall I’m enjoying this controller so far. I’m also super appreciative of the support I received after I had issues with the first unit. This is a company that stands behind their product and will work with you if there are issues.**First Edit**Original review below, but I do want to share that I've been in contact with the PICTEK company who have been very responsive and helpful. I am supposed to be receiving a replacement controller from them soon and will follow-up on my review once I've received it.*******I received the controller today, and followed the instructions but the controller will not connect. When I first plugged in the controller with the included cable the light on the back turned on to indicate that it was plugged in/charging. I held the Home button for 2s, controller flashed white however it never turned blue to indicate that it connected as regular controllers would. I tried again, and the white light started to flash again, but still no connection was made. As a last ditch effort, I tried a different USB cable but I got the same result.For what it’s worth, I like the way the controller feels in my hand, but since I can’t get it to connect right out of the box nor find any good means to troubleshoot I’m disappointed in this product.\n"", ""\n  Been putting this though the ringer for multiple games and it works perfectly. The build quality is solid and the battery lasts a long time. The touch pad is accurate and all the buttons are well placed. It's the same size as a Xbone controller with a slight design change that makes it much better. The grips have a flattened area so it doesn't dig into your palms as much.As for game feel, it is perfect for fighting games, fps, and third person shooters. I would recommend aginst using it in RPGs where you need to make selections with the d pad and 2d platforms due to the non removable sheild D-pad.The only downsides are that the DPad sheild is not removable and it can not turn the console on from sleep mode. Other than that, it's a perfect alternative especially for the price.\n""]"
