Will never purchase again, do not recommend.As of June 29, 2019 I've updated this review by redacting the brand name that makes Select-A-Size paper towels and I wanted to add this last note: Amazon's brand does preform better than Target's generic brand.  Amazon's is thicker and more absorbent than Target's attempt at the same product (Target's version is so thin it rips up whilst just trying to tear a sheet off).  So if you or your household's go-to paper towel is Target's, Amazon's version is an upgrade.

I usually get Sparkle and here's my comparison:PROS -TEXTURE AND ABSORBENCY -I LIKE both Sparkle and Brawny, but like Brawny better.SIZE OF ROLL - GOOD SIZE roll for price.SHEET SIZE CHOICE - I REALLY like I can tear a little or a lot.  BRAWNY gave me more options.  Sometimes I just need a LITTLE piece and BRAWNY lets me take just a bit, a small sheet or more.COST - Pretty comparable, but depends which is on sale.  Happy with the size of the rolls and the price.I would happily use Brawny if it and Sparkle are the same price.\n"", '\n  I used to only use Brawny. I clean houses so I’m always needing paper towels. I had them on auto ship and 2x already, they’ve been out of stock and couldn’t be delivered. And I understand that can happen but what really irks me is the quality now. The quality actually just kept getting worse with every shipment. I’ve used 5 rolls of this last 2 pack shipment and I just had to go buy a different brand. The absorbency is sub par and the fact that they now leave fuzz on everything they come in contact with is the reason I’ve decided to go with a different brand. I will add that the price gouging on this product is mind blowing! I was paying $22 and checked the other day to find the same exact product price had risen to $54.50. Come on Amazon—-if you can suspend the account for “excessive returns” maybe you need to get quality control so you aren’t shipping out crap products that need to be returned! I’m seriously debating on renewing my membership next month.\n', '\n  I love being able to year off smaller squares!  I feel like I’m able to save money by not having to use a whole towel when it’s not necessary. Great napkin size too.\n', '\n  I purchased and received this item at a reasonable price of approximately $48. I checked this item again to re-order however the price is now $212.02. This is definitely price gouging in this current environment. The Federal and Provincial Government have indicated this is illegal.\n']"

However, their quality is ridiculously bad all of a sudden.  The rolls are not tearing along the perforations as they are designed to do (and which they’ve done previously) and there is little more annoying than yanking your towel off the roll on the counter only to have it all come unspun or to rip in some random place.  I pay more for this brand than others and expect quality.  I called Georgia Pacific (manufacturer) and also emailed them.  I eventually got an email back with a case # asking for many specifics including UPC codes and proof of purchase which I provided in a response email.....never heard back.  A month or so later, I got a call back from my previous voice mail to them, with different case #, asking that I call back.  I called back and referenced the case number exactly as they requested and, again, never heard back.  Today, many weeks later, I got a form letter in the mail with a coupons for a free 6 pack (I purchased a 16 pack) up to $7 value.  And of course, there is no 6 pack option on amazon (where I purchased these) for less than $7, not to mention that it does not solve my complaint about the other 10 rolls in the 16 pack I originally purchased.  I would say, terrible quality, absolutely non existent customer service and an ultimately closed case on their end with a mailed coupon that does not even reimburse the quantity indicated on the coupon, meaning they want me to pay more money for the privilege of purchasing their defective and terrible quality product.  And as a consumer, I will always give my business to those companies who demonstrate a value for their consumers.  This company was not interested in a consumers experience with their product so they could correct some production line error.  Rather, they just wanted to send a form letter and some cheap generic coupon.  Sorry to tell you Georgia Pacific (Brawny), but Proctor and Gamble will get my next order....shame on you, taking advantage of people during a pandemic with shoddy, overpriced garbage!\n', '\n  It’s kind of weird writing a review about this item, but my feelings are so strong that I’m compelled.  I needed paper towel during a stay-at-home order, and with all the shortages, this is what I could find for delivery at the time.  I have to say, it really sucks compared to Bounty.  It’s just not nearly as strong and absorbent, and while I thought the quarter sheet idea was interesting in theory, it’s actually pretty dumb in reality.  It’s kind of hard to rip off a quarter quickly or with wet hands, and there are very few situations when I thought, “Boy, a half sheet just seems like too much!”  Mostly the extra perforations just make the towels fall apart when you’re trying to use them, which is super annoying.  So these were better than going without at a time when I didn’t want to risk contracting disease to battle a bunch of people for paper products at Target first thing in the morning, but I don’t plan on buying again if I can help it.\n', '\n  I have used Brawny for years and loved them. My most recent bulk shipment cost more than buying in the store and they fall apart  as I am cleaning.  I dont need anyone to rip my paper towel in half and then in quarters... i want the old sturdy Brawny that earned my business  Sadly this is not it.  I can rip it myself if i want to  But i cant heal the pieces that fall apart as i clean up spills.  Very unhappy with the price and the excessive perforations.\n', '\n  I did not realize that the usual select-a-size sheets tore in half until I got them! Ok so Brawny was already my favorite paper towel. This just took things to the next level.\n', '\n  We have used the Brawny Select A Size for a couple years.  I like the ability to use full or half size sheets.  So when I saw that we are now getting the quarter size option, I thought that maybe I would use it occasionally.  Boy, was I wrong.  Who knew how often the quarter size would get used - apparently the answer is lots and lots of times.  My teenage kids use 1 quarter sheet to put a sandwich on and the other quarter they use as a napkin.  I guess there’s no reason they couldn’t have done this with the unperforated half sheet and just torn it in half but they just used 2 half sheets then instead of 2 quarter sheets now.  I know it sounds kind of dumb, but we do eat a lot of sandwiches my house and this has really made a difference in reducing our paper towel usage.  I definitely recommend this item - you might be surprised how frequently the quarter sheet option is used.\n', ""\n  Other people have complained about this.  They ordered BOUNTY but they were sent Brawny instead.  I think this happened to me.  In my opinion BOUNTY is the only good paper towes out there.  Brawny is smaller rolls. I suppose I have to use them, but next time I'm going to double check.\n"", ""\n  I bought these because of the four square design.  It might be nice if they were easy to tear there but it's not so no point.They're not worth the money.  This is way, way too expensive for paper towels and what you get.\n"", '\n  I am so tired of buying cheap paper towels that end up being less then paper thin. But the thick ones usually cost more for less paper towel!Soooo happy with these! Good price, thick, durable, and have both a lengthwise cut and a widthwise fold.BRILLIANT!Have definitely recommended them\n', '\n  Great quality, I’m not disappointed at all. And I do appreciate the ability to easily tear of a quarter sheet rather than just a half sheet like most brands offer. It’s a New feature that I’ve never had, although have found myself doing often with other paper towels.I find the absorbency to be good. They’re not out-of-this-world but they are more than adequate and of decent value. Overall I’d say it’s a great buy.\n', '\n  I have used paper towels that could be separated lengthwise, but being able to also tear horizontally is new to me! Using only as much as you need, helps to reduce waste. The towels don’t leave “paper fuzz” on windows or mirrors. They absorb liquids very well and last longer than I would expect before more paper towel is needed. Amazon’s price was much better than our what I would pay in stores.\n', ""\n  The idea is awesome and gets you sold instantly.Problem is the idea doesn't work, or it isn't done right.Once you start pulling it's like playing roulette; You don't know what size you're going to get. Is it going to be half of a square, or is it going to be one square and a half? Count yourself lucky if you actually get the square you're buying this thing for. Even getting just a regular sheet, or half a sheet is a pita.It was actually less effort to get my square when tearing half a bounty sheet.Did a quick, non scientific, absorption test and it's less than same size bountyI'm stuck with so many of them now!Don't waste your money. The idea is great, this product just didn't get it right.\n""]"
