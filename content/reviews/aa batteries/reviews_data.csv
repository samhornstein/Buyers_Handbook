The results showed that the Amazon battery is about 88 percent the capacity of the Duracell. If you calculate the cost per unit capacity, the batteries are almost identical. The Amazon battery was actually slightly more expensive when represented in cost per Watt-Hour. Because of this I would probably choose the Procell (if I can get a good price on it) just because it means less frequent battery changes. The Amazon battery is a surprisingly good battery though. You will probably barely notice the difference in capacity, so if you don't want to waste time shopping around then its a good choice.I also performed the same test on Duracell Copper Top, and Energizer Max. Their performance was nearly identical to the Procell. More interestingly, I tested the Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA cell. This cell was 4 times the cost of a procell at $1.27 per cell! However the capacity was only 1.5 times that of the Procell. So don't waste your money on these batteries, they're much more expensive per unit of capacity. The capacity of all these batteries were measured in Watt-Hours. Here are the numbers.AA Amazon Battery = 2.71 Wh. My cost per cell = $0.291. Cost per Watt-Hour = $0.107AA Duracell Procell = 3.09 Wh. My cost per cell = $0.321. Cost per Watt-Hour = $0.104AA Energizer Lithium = 4.86 Wh. My cost per cell = $1.27. Cost per Watt-Hour = $0.261This test was done using an op-amp circuit to maintain a constant current load at 100ma. Voltage and current were being logged ounce per minute and this data was used to calculate the Amp-Hour with a 0.8 volt cutoff. The Watt-Hour was then calculated by multiplying the Amp-Hour by the average voltage from the beginning of the test to 0.8 volts. All batteries mentioned were tested using this same method. Note that the capacity of these batteries can change dramatically under different conditions. The same battery under a heavy load will have a fraction of the capacity that it would under a light load. This data is only good for a comparison when choosing what battery is worth buying at what price. Unless your device loads the battery at a constant current of 100ma.In summery, the Amazon batteries are not bad batteries (at least based on this test using the AA cell). If you choose to shop around for a name brand battery, stay at or below $0.33 per cell. Anything above $0.33 per cell will be more expensive per unit capacity than the Amazon battery. Oh, and definitely stay away from the Energizer Lithium unless expense is not an issue. These batteries are only worth the additional cost if your application requires a light weight and relatively high capacity battery regardless of cost. These batteries are surprisingly light weight compared to an alkaline.lkaline.\n"", ""\n  I've been buying AA and AAA batteries from Amazon Basics for a couple of years now. They recently changed the packaging (and presumably the manufacturer) and now they only last half as long. I tried a pair of Duracell AAs to test my hypothesis and they lasted almost three times as long. I wanted to stop buying these Amazon batteries, but it turns out that, at around $0.25 each and $0.90 for Duracell, they're still cheaper overall than buying name brand. However, it is extremely disappointing to watch them deliberately drop the quality and force us to purchase batteries more frequently. They've basically pulled a bait-and-switch with us, sucking us in with high quality batteries and then trading them out for lemons without dropping the price commensurately. Their packaging may be frustration-free, but these batteries sure aren't.\n"", ""\n  Don't buy these.  I did save a bunch of $'s, however once I started using them I have had at least 8 of them explode, leak and corrode.  I use them in power blinds and had 2 of the battery cartridges for the blinds destroyed....costing $20 each to be replaced.  Move on...don't purchase these.  To late to get my money back because I wanted these on hand for when the originals failed, which started in Jan 2018.8 failures in 3 months once I started using them costing me over $40 to replace the damaged battery holders.\n"", ""\n  I loved these batteries when  I first started buying them. They were cheap and seemed to last. Then I bought 48! I figured - cheaper by the (4) dozen - Big mistake! Not only don't they hold a charge in a device, they are actually dead coming out of the shrink wrap. I actually had a couple literally fall apart in a camera. Luckily there was no damage. I expect high quality from Amazon basic products - they usually are great - but these batteries are terrible!.\n"", '\n  I read a lot of reviews and convinced myself the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries were going to be a good buy.  Nope.  I put a pair in my TV remote, and within a month the TV was telling me to replace the batteries because of low power.  I decided to check some new ones right out of the wrapper with my battery tester.  8 brand new batteries tested - all 8 in the red on the battery tester...not totally dead, but just inside the red.  Next trip to Home Depot, I picked up the big pack of Energizer AA batteries and did the same test on them.  8 for 8 all in the green on my battery tester.Oh well, not worth crying about $13 worth of weak batteries.  I am sure others have had great luck with the same AmazonBasics AA batteries.  I just wanted to add my experience so others can make an informed decision.  Good luck!\n', ""\n  They work, absolutely!  And they look really cute and come packaged well.  But, they just don't last very long.For example, I have two small strands of fairy lights that are battery dependent (pictured with AA battery for size comparison).  Each strand needs 3 AA batteries.  They have a timer allowing for 8 hours of use every day.  When the ikeabrand batteries died (after being in use for 1 year), I replaced the batteries with these amazon basics batteries.  The amazon basic batteries only lasted one month.  That's an 11 month difference for the same amount of usage.  Maybe I just got a bad batch.  *shrugs*  I am, and will always be, an amazon basics purchaser, but I'll go back to other battery brands once these run out. (which won't take too long at this rate.)\n"", ""\n  I use these at church for wireless microphones.  We had previously used the standard Duracell brand batteries, and would generally get 3-4 weeks (about 2 hours per week) out of them before they needed to be replaced.  These only seem to last about 2 weeks at best.  We'll be switching back to Duracell for this application.I would certainly use these for applications around the house... toys, remotes, keyboard/mouse, etc, but we need to make sure our batteries don't die in the middle of a church service, so we'll still to the good ones for our application.\n"", '\n  ¿En serio estás leyendo las opiniones de unas pilas?

SHAME AMAZON\n', ""\n  Not all batteries are created equal and with so many choices out there its difficult to choose the best option. I've been using these for a couple of years now and have been perfectly happy with their performance. They are alkaline based batteries which make them a pretty good, standard battery and suitable for 90% of applications. Remote controls, clocks, cameras, radios will all run fine on these and will last fine.It's great to have a bulk store of batteries at such an affordable price. I now have a drawer stocked with batteries and not a jumbled up collection, of different brands missed with part-used batteries. I restock when I start to get low and I'm never caught short.As I said, these will do for 90% of applications but if you do need more power for a particularly high drain device then look for lithium-based batteries, they will outperform these amazon basics but expect to pay a lot more. It would be nice to see Amazon basics add lithium batteries to there current offerings for such occasions.If you found this review helpful, please hit the 'Helpful' button to let me know that writing these reviews is worthwhile.\n"", ""\n  I have always bought brand name batteries after having a bad experience with own brand ones not lasting long several years ago but saw these on offer on prime day for a fraction of the price of Energizer and Duracell so thought I'd give them a try.

I have 2 small children and go through batteries relatively quickly, I've bought rechargeable ones in the past but am always forgetting to charge them so never have any ready when I need them!I have been using them for a few weeks in a range of devices, remote controls, white noise machine, annoying kids toys etc and on all occasions they have performed perfectly. One of my daughters toys eats batteries and these have last as long as if not slightly longer on a set of batteries than it was on brand name ones so very happy!\n""]"

The results showed that the Amazon battery is about 88 percent the capacity of the Duracell. If you calculate the cost per unit capacity, the batteries are almost identical. The Amazon battery was actually slightly more expensive when represented in cost per Watt-Hour. Because of this I would probably choose the Procell (if I can get a good price on it) just because it means less frequent battery changes. The Amazon battery is a surprisingly good battery though. You will probably barely notice the difference in capacity, so if you don't want to waste time shopping around then its a good choice.I also performed the same test on Duracell Copper Top, and Energizer Max. Their performance was nearly identical to the Procell. More interestingly, I tested the Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA cell. This cell was 4 times the cost of a procell at $1.27 per cell! However the capacity was only 1.5 times that of the Procell. So don't waste your money on these batteries, they're much more expensive per unit of capacity. The capacity of all these batteries were measured in Watt-Hours. Here are the numbers.AA Amazon Battery = 2.71 Wh. My cost per cell = $0.291. Cost per Watt-Hour = $0.107AA Duracell Procell = 3.09 Wh. My cost per cell = $0.321. Cost per Watt-Hour = $0.104AA Energizer Lithium = 4.86 Wh. My cost per cell = $1.27. Cost per Watt-Hour = $0.261This test was done using an op-amp circuit to maintain a constant current load at 100ma. Voltage and current were being logged ounce per minute and this data was used to calculate the Amp-Hour with a 0.8 volt cutoff. The Watt-Hour was then calculated by multiplying the Amp-Hour by the average voltage from the beginning of the test to 0.8 volts. All batteries mentioned were tested using this same method. Note that the capacity of these batteries can change dramatically under different conditions. The same battery under a heavy load will have a fraction of the capacity that it would under a light load. This data is only good for a comparison when choosing what battery is worth buying at what price. Unless your device loads the battery at a constant current of 100ma.In summery, the Amazon batteries are not bad batteries (at least based on this test using the AA cell). If you choose to shop around for a name brand battery, stay at or below $0.33 per cell. Anything above $0.33 per cell will be more expensive per unit capacity than the Amazon battery. Oh, and definitely stay away from the Energizer Lithium unless expense is not an issue. These batteries are only worth the additional cost if your application requires a light weight and relatively high capacity battery regardless of cost. These batteries are surprisingly light weight compared to an alkaline.lkaline.\n"", ""\n  I've been buying AA and AAA batteries from Amazon Basics for a couple of years now. They recently changed the packaging (and presumably the manufacturer) and now they only last half as long. I tried a pair of Duracell AAs to test my hypothesis and they lasted almost three times as long. I wanted to stop buying these Amazon batteries, but it turns out that, at around $0.25 each and $0.90 for Duracell, they're still cheaper overall than buying name brand. However, it is extremely disappointing to watch them deliberately drop the quality and force us to purchase batteries more frequently. They've basically pulled a bait-and-switch with us, sucking us in with high quality batteries and then trading them out for lemons without dropping the price commensurately. Their packaging may be frustration-free, but these batteries sure aren't.\n"", ""\n  Don't buy these.  I did save a bunch of $'s, however once I started using them I have had at least 8 of them explode, leak and corrode.  I use them in power blinds and had 2 of the battery cartridges for the blinds destroyed....costing $20 each to be replaced.  Move on...don't purchase these.  To late to get my money back because I wanted these on hand for when the originals failed, which started in Jan 2018.8 failures in 3 months once I started using them costing me over $40 to replace the damaged battery holders.\n"", ""\n  I loved these batteries when  I first started buying them. They were cheap and seemed to last. Then I bought 48! I figured - cheaper by the (4) dozen - Big mistake! Not only don't they hold a charge in a device, they are actually dead coming out of the shrink wrap. I actually had a couple literally fall apart in a camera. Luckily there was no damage. I expect high quality from Amazon basic products - they usually are great - but these batteries are terrible!.\n"", '\n  I read a lot of reviews and convinced myself the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries were going to be a good buy.  Nope.  I put a pair in my TV remote, and within a month the TV was telling me to replace the batteries because of low power.  I decided to check some new ones right out of the wrapper with my battery tester.  8 brand new batteries tested - all 8 in the red on the battery tester...not totally dead, but just inside the red.  Next trip to Home Depot, I picked up the big pack of Energizer AA batteries and did the same test on them.  8 for 8 all in the green on my battery tester.Oh well, not worth crying about $13 worth of weak batteries.  I am sure others have had great luck with the same AmazonBasics AA batteries.  I just wanted to add my experience so others can make an informed decision.  Good luck!\n', ""\n  They work, absolutely!  And they look really cute and come packaged well.  But, they just don't last very long.For example, I have two small strands of fairy lights that are battery dependent (pictured with AA battery for size comparison).  Each strand needs 3 AA batteries.  They have a timer allowing for 8 hours of use every day.  When the ikeabrand batteries died (after being in use for 1 year), I replaced the batteries with these amazon basics batteries.  The amazon basic batteries only lasted one month.  That's an 11 month difference for the same amount of usage.  Maybe I just got a bad batch.  *shrugs*  I am, and will always be, an amazon basics purchaser, but I'll go back to other battery brands once these run out. (which won't take too long at this rate.)\n"", ""\n  I use these at church for wireless microphones.  We had previously used the standard Duracell brand batteries, and would generally get 3-4 weeks (about 2 hours per week) out of them before they needed to be replaced.  These only seem to last about 2 weeks at best.  We'll be switching back to Duracell for this application.I would certainly use these for applications around the house... toys, remotes, keyboard/mouse, etc, but we need to make sure our batteries don't die in the middle of a church service, so we'll still to the good ones for our application.\n"", '\n  ¿En serio estás leyendo las opiniones de unas pilas?

Baja al supermercado, compra un poquito de jamón serrano, un poquito de queso y una botella de vino y deja de leer esto.\n', '\n  innerhalb von wenigen Tagen leer!Wenn eine Batterie es nicht schafft eine kleine LED Kerze über längere Zeit zum Leuchten zu bringen, dann sind auch die 48 Stück überflüssig und auf Dauer zu teuer.Wir nutzen diese AmazonBasic, AA in unseren kleinen LED Kerzen (Foto) die eigentlich kaum Energie benötigen und wir diese täglich 4- 6 Stunden am Tag brennen lassen, doch mit diesen AmazonBasics Performance Alkali, AA Batterien bleiben sie nach wenigen Tagen schon dunkel.

Using in Wall Clock, 1st one lasted 40 days & 2nd one lasted 47 days only. A normal Zinc Carbon (Dry Cell) lasts 6-8 months and are much much cheaper.These are not Alkalines I guess... not even Zinc Carbon (Dry Cell).Very much dissatisfied as I Bought them over Duracell because of the pricing and “amazon basics” assurance. SHAME AMAZON\n', ""\n  Not all batteries are created equal and with so many choices out there its difficult to choose the best option. I've been using these for a couple of years now and have been perfectly happy with their performance. They are alkaline based batteries which make them a pretty good, standard battery and suitable for 90% of applications. Remote controls, clocks, cameras, radios will all run fine on these and will last fine.It's great to have a bulk store of batteries at such an affordable price. I now have a drawer stocked with batteries and not a jumbled up collection, of different brands missed with part-used batteries. I restock when I start to get low and I'm never caught short.As I said, these will do for 90% of applications but if you do need more power for a particularly high drain device then look for lithium-based batteries, they will outperform these amazon basics but expect to pay a lot more. It would be nice to see Amazon basics add lithium batteries to there current offerings for such occasions.If you found this review helpful, please hit the 'Helpful' button to let me know that writing these reviews is worthwhile.\n"", ""\n  I have always bought brand name batteries after having a bad experience with own brand ones not lasting long several years ago but saw these on offer on prime day for a fraction of the price of Energizer and Duracell so thought I'd give them a try. I paid just under £20 for 100 batteries. I have 2 small children and go through batteries relatively quickly, I've bought rechargeable ones in the past but am always forgetting to charge them so never have any ready when I need them!I have been using them for a few weeks in a range of devices, remote controls, white noise machine, annoying kids toys etc and on all occasions they have performed perfectly. One of my daughters toys eats batteries and these have last as long as if not slightly longer on a set of batteries than it was on brand name ones so very happy!\n""]"

I guess we\'ll have to see after 2 years of usage lol BUT there are no instructions on how to open it. Why is this important? We tend to open and use a couple of batteries at a time out of the 24 batteries in the pack. The package is usually used as a form of storage for the remaining batteries. It took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to open it correctly reading borderline microscopic labeling  (literally, some words on the back label are microscopic; see photos).
