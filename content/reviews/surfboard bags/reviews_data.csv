My Ocean & Earth and Dakine bags disintegrated in the hot California sun! I learned my lesson. Take care of my boards AND my bags! They aren\'t exactly cheap!1) 6\' x 22"" bag.  For my Fish 5\'10"" x 21"" x 2.5""2) 6\'6"" x 22"" bag.  For my Fish 6\'4"" x 21"" x 2.5""Feels like my old bags, quality. I don\'t take my fins off, too lazy so it fits very snug. Barely fit, lol. But that\'s how I like it :) I did ask them, they said ""no"" but I didn\'t get the reply until after I ordered it. No patience, haha. Good thing it worked out. Probably be good for travel too. The name tho... lol.\n', '\n  I bought the 10-foot bag for my longboard (10\'0""x24""x3.5"").  It\'s very, very uncomfortable to take out from the bag a ten-foot board because the zipper only opens the bottom half of the bag (the zipper only goes from side-to-side of the lower-half of the bag).  If you\'re in a sandy beach it\'s no problem, in the sense that you rest the board\'s tail in the sand and pull the bag from the front; but what about rocky beaches?  Or a concrete driveway where you want to rinse the board?  This bag requires two people to manipulate a longboard!Also, if you want to rinse the bag itself with tap water it takes forever to dry, because in the top half of the bag there is no opening.That same length of zipper could have been placed along a single side of the bag, and then the bag would pretty much open like a book, and then entry & exit would be a breeze.  It\'s seems crazy.\n', '\n  Just got a 5\'7"" ""Long board"" for summer swell in Hawaii, and my regular short board bag couldn\'t quite fit it with the fins. Saw this board bag, and decided to try it.  Great value for the price. Well made. Allows for expansion at the tail to keep the fins on, the rounded nose easily accommodates the nose of this board, and the carrying options are great. The clips used on the arm strap are actually really well designed. I expect they will hold up better with their spring loaded clip style (vs the plastic push-in kind).  Overall great design & great bag for the price!\n', '\n  Certainly adequate to protect the new 6\'6"" fish. I got the 7\' bag since I\'m mostly just throwing it the back of the truck and driving a few blocks to my main surf spot with fins on. I cannot see where the thickness will be an issue for just about any application outside of air travel.I really like the two pockets. I usually have to carry a backpack with phone, glasses, etc. Not only can I keep a couple bars of wax literally in hand before stepping in the water instead of remembering to grab before leaving, but keys, phone, go pro, etc. I really like the second hidden pocket with velcro on the inside of the bag so feel safer leaving it on the beach.4 instead of 5 because I have not tested the durability. One of the zippers on the outside pocket was off the track too, but back and forth seemed to fix that. Just hope the main zipper is durable.\n', ""\n  This surf board bag has a near 5 star rating for a reason.  The price is far less than the big name brands, it is available on Amazon Prime, it has great features, sturdy construction, and looks great.  The quality of the stitching, edging, zippers, fabric and other materials is much better than I have seen in other bags at this price range.  The protective padding throughout is good enough for airline travel (of course I always use pipe insulation for extra rail protection in any bag).  The nose and tail sections of the bag are reinforced with heavy duty fabric and extra padding.  The inside of the bag has a velcro pouch for fins and small items.  The outside of the bag has a large, heavy duty zipper pouch that can fit a wetsuit, etc.  I have read other reviews that suggest the zipper is short.  I disagree.  The zipper on the 6.0' bag runs nearly half the length of the bag...more than sufficient.  I can't speak for the length of the zippers on the longer board bags.  The zippers are heavy duty with nice pull cords on them.  There is also a unique padded zipper flap that protects your board rails from the zipper.  The handle is sturdy cordura style fabric with fabric covered padding.  The shoulder strap is durable, adjustable, removable and has good padding.  The clips that attach the shoulder strap to the bag have a very unique, heavy duty, corrosion proof plastic design.  The 6.0' bag has a curved nose end and broad square tail shape to fit a wide variety of board shapes up to 6 feet in length.  It has no problem fitting my sub 6.0 boards with fins on, and I think it will fit a 6 foot board with fins on as well, but I don't have a board that length to test it.  Once again, the materials and workmanship have a very premium look and feel.  The last bag I had that was built this well lasted me 18+ years.  I am convinced this board bag will perform well and last a long time.  I love it and will definitely buy it again for my other boards.\n"", '\n  I use this bag for my 6’3” lost rnf redux. It’s a wide fat hybrid fish and this bag fits it perfect. I have extra room for padding if I wanna travel with it and I can even throw my fins/wetsuit, towel, poncho, changing mat and everything I need in the bag. I even use the top zip pocket for my wax and a change of clothes. It has pretty thick padding and is really a high quality bag. If you are thinking about getting this bag do it. You for sure won’t regret it. I’m about to buy 2 more for my other boards\n', '\n  I gave this a 5 for being a good, basic day board bag.  I like that there\'s enough room for wider boards & a little extra length, so the zipper won\'t rub (directly) on the boards.  I got the 6\' 0"" board bag for my ""hybrid"" boards that are between 5\' 9"" - 5\' 11"" x 19 1/2"" - 20 1/2"" & they all fit quite well.  Now, if you\'re looking for a true travel bag.......I would recommend something more heavy duty.  Overall, the quality seems good for the price, but remember.....I gave my rating for this being a day bag.\n', '\n  The bag fit my new board fine.  Someone left a previous comment that the bag is quite thin.  It is not made to be a travel bag, but a day bag for protection to and from the beach.\n']"

They’ve given you enough room for a long fin, but if not, there is velrcro that automatically snaps together to keep it down tight. I like how the bag is reinforced with waterproof canvas on each end and in the middle where bags tend to get the most wear and tear besides at the zippers and handle.I expect it to hold up better than other board bags I’ve had that have shred pretty quickly.The bag as a whole seems to be all quality materials and craftsmanship. The handle and zippers are well made and sturdy, and the stitching is all reinforced well. There is an inner Velcro pocket to hold surf wax. There is a fairly large side zippered pocket that could hold a rash guard, extra board shorts or swimsuit. It comes with a carrying strap that could be handy if you’re traveling through an airport with your board. It has the usual amount of padding that most boardbags have.My husband is going to buy one after seeing mine because of the good quality and good price. They come in 3 sizes so he will get the short  board size. It seems like a quality company who has thought through the design well so that it functions as a boardbag should. The fabric and colors silver and navy are low key and masculine, but I don’t mind. If they made some with pretty fabric, they could probably sell more to women.\n', '\n  quality bag, quality materials, heat vent, fin pocket, and stitching is good. I cannot attest for durability due to just getting the bag, but I know even Dakine or FCS bags do not last very many seasons before the reflective materials starts to breakdown. So, if you are a weekend surfer or every now and then, this bag should give you years of good use. I am a daily surfer and move my bags around alot as well as fly them quite often so they get the brute wear and tear of a surfer.\n', '\n  After searching high and low for a good bag and one that would fit my 8\' foot board I chose this 8\'6"".I chose the longer bag as I\'ve read too many reviews of other bags not fitting the board so I went up in size. As you can see by the pictures, I could have gone with an 8\' bag for my 8\' board.With the bag zipped completely, I don\'t have to worry about the fins sticking out. Granted, I don\'t have a huge single fin but 3 smaller fins. With the extra space I can easily put my full suit inside with the board. The padding is nice enough that I don\'t worry about scraping or dinging the board when I put it in the bed of my truck.The zippers feel good and are big so hopefully they won\'t snag over time. The feel on the silver portion is like that of a thick blue tarp you\'d get at the local hardware store. There are a couple vents on the bottom of the bag so if you like putting it away wet, it just might be dry the next time you pull it out.If there are other pictures from different angles you want to see, let me know.\n', ""\n  Just got it but it seems really good and strong, big zippers, doubled stiched, heavy duty webbing straps and shoulder strap connections. Even has two drain holes for water and the are nicely set in the bag. Fits my 6' Rocketwide like a glove. Has a HUGE outer pocket and small internal pocket. Best value for a bag hand's down. I took a star off cause the logo/name is just super lame. I colored it in with black waterproof marker so it's not noticeable.\n"", '\n  I am glad I waited. This bag fits my 6\'4"" Kane Gardens fish perfectly. The Quality is AMAZING and the zippers and ability to leave the fins on is great. Just enough room to fit wax and other small items with out being oversized and baggy. Also what at great price for the quality of the bag, noting cheap here and would highly recommend to anyone. The Zippers will outlast me and zip easily. LOVE IT!!!!!\n', ""\n  Build quality materials and price are absolutely superb what more could you ask for of any product. This bag is the truth I couldn't be happier with the product. My brother ordered a bag from a known popular surf brand  (rimes with wakkine I ordered this same time and he's very unhappy with the difference in fit and quality is a million times better than his bag) and it didn't even fit his board this thing is tailored perfect for boards stardard or wide and fins or no fins. If you need a bag just buy this one from this company and you couldn't be happier.\n"", '\n  Product fit surfboard perfectly and provided nice support for the board. Was easy to carry and holds a lot of extra stuff so you don’t have to worry about your keys or towels. Very lightweight and distributes weight on your shoulder very evenly. Great product for such an inexpensive price. Many other bags that do the same thing are much more expensive, don’t waste your money.\n', '\n  I am an experienced long time surfer with several boards.  I needed a bag for my new foam 9’ Catch-All Log.  I was very concerned about the fit because of the width and thickness of the board. Foamies are definitely thick and wide! Ordered the 9’6’ Abahub and it fit perfectly.  In fact, I would recommend the 9’6” bag for any 9’ board that you might be concerned about. I was also pleasantly surprised at the quality and workmanship that was evident.  I have several other expensive brand bags, this bag is just as nice.  One of my other bags has seen a lot of travel and I will be having to replace it.  I will be definitely replacing it with a Abahub.\n']"
