My Ocean & Earth and Dakine bags disintegrated in the hot California sun! I learned my lesson. Take care of my boards AND my bags! They aren\'t exactly cheap!1) 6\' x 22"" bag.  For my Fish 5\'10"" x 21"" x 2.5""2) 6\'6"" x 22"" bag.  For my Fish 6\'4"" x 21"" x 2.5""Feels like my old bags, quality. I don\'t take my fins off, too lazy so it fits very snug. Barely fit, lol.

The name tho... lol.\n', '\n  I bought the 10-foot bag for my longboard (10\'0""x24""x3.5"").  It\'s very, very uncomfortable to take out from the bag a ten-foot board because the zipper only opens the bottom half of the bag (the zipper only goes from side-to-side of the lower-half of the bag).  If you\'re in a sandy beach it\'s no problem, in the sense that you rest the board\'s tail in the sand and pull the bag from the front; but what about rocky beaches?  Or a concrete driveway where you want to rinse the board?  This bag requires two people to manipulate a longboard!Also, if you want to rinse the bag itself with tap water it takes forever to dry, because in the top half of the bag there is no opening.That same length of zipper could have been placed along a single side of the bag, and then the bag would pretty much open like a book, and then entry & exit would be a breeze.  It\'s seems crazy.\n', '\n  Just got a 5\'7"" ""Long board"" for summer swell in Hawaii, and my regular short board bag couldn\'t quite fit it with the fins. Saw this board bag, and decided to try it.  Great value for the price. Well made. Allows for expansion at the tail to keep the fins on, the rounded nose easily accommodates the nose of this board, and the carrying options are great. The clips used on the arm strap are actually really well designed. I expect they will hold up better with their spring loaded clip style (vs the plastic push-in kind).  Overall great design & great bag for the price!\n', '\n  Certainly adequate to protect the new 6\'6"" fish. I got the 7\' bag since I\'m mostly just throwing it the back of the truck and driving a few blocks to my main surf spot with fins on. I cannot see where the thickness will be an issue for just about any application outside of air travel.I really like the two pockets. I usually have to carry a backpack with phone, glasses, etc. Not only can I keep a couple bars of wax literally in hand before stepping in the water instead of remembering to grab before leaving, but keys, phone, go pro, etc. I really like the second hidden pocket with velcro on the inside of the bag so feel safer leaving it on the beach.4 instead of 5 because I have not tested the durability. One of the zippers on the outside pocket was off the track too, but back and forth seemed to fix that. Just hope the main zipper is durable.\n', ""\n  This surf board bag has a near 5 star rating for a reason.  The price is far less than the big name brands, it is available on Amazon Prime, it has great features, sturdy construction, and looks great.  The quality of the stitching, edging, zippers, fabric and other materials is much better than I have seen in other bags at this price range.  The protective padding throughout is good enough for airline travel (of course I always use pipe insulation for extra rail protection in any bag).  The nose and tail sections of the bag are reinforced with heavy duty fabric and extra padding.  The inside of the bag has a velcro pouch for fins and small items.  The outside of the bag has a large, heavy duty zipper pouch that can fit a wetsuit, etc.  I have read other reviews that suggest the zipper is short.  I disagree.  The zipper on the 6.0' bag runs nearly half the length of the bag...more than sufficient.  I can't speak for the length of the zippers on the longer board bags.  The zippers are heavy duty with nice pull cords on them.  There is also a unique padded zipper flap that protects your board rails from the zipper.  The handle is sturdy cordura style fabric with fabric covered padding.  The shoulder strap is durable, adjustable, removable and has good padding.  The clips that attach the shoulder strap to the bag have a very unique, heavy duty, corrosion proof plastic design.  The 6.0' bag has a curved nose end and broad square tail shape to fit a wide variety of board shapes up to 6 feet in length.  It has no problem fitting my sub 6.0 boards with fins on, and I think it will fit a 6 foot board with fins on as well, but I don't have a board that length to test it.  Once again, the materials and workmanship have a very premium look and feel.  The last bag I had that was built this well lasted me 18+ years.  I am convinced this board bag will perform well and last a long time.  I love it and will definitely buy it again for my other boards.\n"", '\n  I use this bag for my 6’3” lost rnf redux. It’s a wide fat hybrid fish and this bag fits it perfect. I have extra room for padding if I wanna travel with it and I can even throw my fins/wetsuit, towel, poncho, changing mat and everything I need in the bag. I even use the top zip pocket for my wax and a change of clothes. It has pretty thick padding and is really a high quality bag. If you are thinking about getting this bag do it. You for sure won’t regret it. I’m about to buy 2 more for my other boards\n', '\n  I gave this a 5 for being a good, basic day board bag.  I like that there\'s enough room for wider boards & a little extra length, so the zipper won\'t rub (directly) on the boards.  I got the 6\' 0"" board bag for my ""hybrid"" boards that are between 5\' 9"" - 5\' 11"" x 19 1/2"" - 20 1/2"" & they all fit quite well.  Now, if you\'re looking for a true travel bag.......I would recommend something more heavy duty.  Overall, the quality seems good for the price, but remember.....I gave my rating for this being a day bag.\n', '\n  The bag fit my new board fine.  Someone left a previous comment that the bag is quite thin.  It is not made to be a travel bag, but a day bag for protection to and from the beach.\n']"

They’ve given you enough room for a long fin, but if not, there is velrcro that automatically snaps together to keep it down tight. I like how the bag is reinforced with waterproof canvas on each end and in the middle where bags tend to get the most wear and tear besides at the zippers and handle.I expect it to hold up better than other board bags I’ve had that have shred pretty quickly.The bag as a whole seems to be all quality materials and craftsmanship. The handle and zippers are well made and sturdy, and the stitching is all reinforced well. There is an inner Velcro pocket to hold surf wax. There is a fairly large side zippered pocket that could hold a rash guard, extra board shorts or swimsuit. It comes with a carrying strap that could be handy if you’re traveling through an airport with your board. It has the usual amount of padding that most boardbags have.My husband is going to buy one after seeing mine because of the good quality and good price. They come in 3 sizes so he will get the short  board size. It seems like a quality company who has thought through the design well so that it functions as a boardbag should. The fabric and colors silver and navy are low key and masculine, but I don’t mind. If they made some with pretty fabric, they could probably sell more to women.\n', '\n  quality bag, quality materials, heat vent, fin pocket, and stitching is good. I cannot attest for durability due to just getting the bag, but I know even Dakine or FCS bags do not last very many seasons before the reflective materials starts to breakdown. So, if you are a weekend surfer or every now and then, this bag should give you years of good use. I am a daily surfer and move my bags around alot as well as fly them quite often so they get the brute wear and tear of a surfer.\n', '\n  After searching high and low for a good bag and one that would fit my 8\' foot board I chose this 8\'6"".I chose the longer bag as I\'ve read too many reviews of other bags not fitting the board so I went up in size. As you can see by the pictures, I could have gone with an 8\' bag for my 8\' board.With the bag zipped completely, I don\'t have to worry about the fins sticking out. Granted, I don\'t have a huge single fin but 3 smaller fins. With the extra space I can easily put my full suit inside with the board. The padding is nice enough that I don\'t worry about scraping or dinging the board when I put it in the bed of my truck.The zippers feel good and are big so hopefully they won\'t snag over time. The feel on the silver portion is like that of a thick blue tarp you\'d get at the local hardware store. There are a couple vents on the bottom of the bag so if you like putting it away wet, it just might be dry the next time you pull it out.If there are other pictures from different angles you want to see, let me know.\n', ""\n  Just got it but it seems really good and strong, big zippers, doubled stiched, heavy duty webbing straps and shoulder strap connections. Even has two drain holes for water and the are nicely set in the bag. Fits my 6' Rocketwide like a glove. Has a HUGE outer pocket and small internal pocket. Best value for a bag hand's down. I took a star off cause the logo/name is just super lame. I colored it in with black waterproof marker so it's not noticeable.\n"", '\n  I am glad I waited. This bag fits my 6\'4"" Kane Gardens fish perfectly. The Quality is AMAZING and the zippers and ability to leave the fins on is great. Just enough room to fit wax and other small items with out being oversized and baggy. Also what at great price for the quality of the bag, noting cheap here and would highly recommend to anyone. The Zippers will outlast me and zip easily. LOVE IT!!!!!\n', ""\n  Build quality materials and price are absolutely superb what more could you ask for of any product. This bag is the truth I couldn't be happier with the product. My brother ordered a bag from a known popular surf brand  (rimes with wakkine I ordered this same time and he's very unhappy with the difference in fit and quality is a million times better than his bag) and it didn't even fit his board this thing is tailored perfect for boards stardard or wide and fins or no fins. If you need a bag just buy this one from this company and you couldn't be happier.\n"", '\n  Product fit surfboard perfectly and provided nice support for the board. Was easy to carry and holds a lot of extra stuff so you don’t have to worry about your keys or towels. Very lightweight and distributes weight on your shoulder very evenly. Great product for such an inexpensive price. Many other bags that do the same thing are much more expensive, don’t waste your money.\n', '\n  I am an experienced long time surfer with several boards.  I needed a bag for my new foam 9’ Catch-All Log.  I was very concerned about the fit because of the width and thickness of the board. Foamies are definitely thick and wide! Ordered the 9’6’ Abahub and it fit perfectly.  In fact, I would recommend the 9’6” bag for any 9’ board that you might be concerned about. I was also pleasantly surprised at the quality and workmanship that was evident.  I have several other expensive brand bags, this bag is just as nice.  One of my other bags has seen a lot of travel and I will be having to replace it.  I will be definitely replacing it with a Abahub.\n']"

I\'m planning on using it for a flight to Mexico. I\'ve never used one before, so I don\'t know how it will go. I\'m going to wrap my board with a moving blanket wrapped around it inside the bag.I have an epoxy board, so I think it will hold up fine.My main reason for my review is to talk about the size. I ordered the 9\'2"" for my 9\'2"" board. I\'m glad I did. I have almost 6"" to spare.

The zipper pulls are heavy duty plastic and will hopefully hold up for the long term. The only reason for docking 1 star is because the padding is a bit thinner than 2 other day bags I own (got them years ago for $50 which is a steal by today's pricing). I have a particularly heavy glassed old school longboard and I would feel more confident in this bag if it had a tad more padding. I'd still recommend this bag for those in search of a bag that's strictly for protection against the inevitable dings and dents that we all dread.\n"", '\n  For the sport of surfing, this bag is HORRIBLE.  It leaks water everywhere.  I emailed the company who said, ""well its not water resistant"".  I find it strange to make a bag for surfing that doesn\'t work well with water.  If the board is wet at all, it sticks to the bag making it hard to take in and out.  Water seems to enter from the outside of the bag (if its raining and your using it for roof racks) then it pours out when you take the bag off the car.  Just spend the extra money and get a real surfboard bag if your a surfer!  Totally not worth the cheap price.\n', ""\n  Just go the bag today. Quick shipping. Have you ever seen one of those thick silver tarps they use to cover stuff with? Well this bag is pretty much made of the same material. Even smells like it, yeah its kinda got that chemical/plastic smell thing going for it, lol. I wouldn't leave it outside for long periods of time as it will probably degrade pretty quickly. Otherwise the product looks great! The zipper looks of high quality, the stitching is good. This is a great bag for the money, if you want something of higher quality, you will need to fork out double what this bag costs.\n"", ""\n  This is a really good deal for the price. I have a 7'6 board and it fits in the 7'6 bag while leaving a few inches of space. I'm happy as it was about half the price of bags I was seeing in the surf shops. It definitely is right for my needs which was just storage and travel to the beach so my board would be protected in the car. The only negative is that it is slightly more thin than other bags I've owned but not enough to where it bothers me I feel like the padding is adequate.\n"", '\n  Really didn’t know what to expect. Pricing vs. competitors vs. quality... upon opening up the package It wasn’t hard to feel and see the quality. I am beyond happy with this purchase. Great for day use. Enough padding for those bumps along the way. My board is 8’6” and it for fine. My only wish is that I could tuck the shoulder strap within the bag. I found a way to tuck strap within handle.\n', '\n  This inexpensive bag is perfect for my needs. I keep as many boards as I can in my van which include SUPs as well as surfboards. I don’t like getting wax all over my van, my boards and the other stuff I keep in the van. Keeping my surfboard in this bag makes it easy and clean. I can’t attest to it’s durability or ability to withstand the weather because it rarely sees the outside of my van. But for my use it is perfect.\n', '\n  Let me start off by saying I searched everywhere to try and find a good surfboard bag for a decent price. After searching for months, I finally took a shot on this one because of Amazon’s return policy, and I’m so happy I did. It’s such a simple and sturdy bag that looks like it would easily be worth $200+. It’s light, it’s thick, it’s convenient, and it even has a wetsuit pocket if you need it. Honestly if you are looking for a surf bag, look no further. I will 10/10 be buying another for my 8’ board.\n']"

In other words, it covers the board, offers a little bit of buffer for dings or scratches, and fits exactly as advertised. However, whatever fabric this thing is made of is like a MAGNET for velcro, and anyone who surfs is more than aware that there\'s definitely velcro out and about.I feel like every time I take my funboard out (the only one with this case -- my others have the hemp cases from....another vendor that I can\'t remember right now), I spend a significant part of the morning fighting with the leash, or my booties, or some other velcro (I use velcro straps with multiple board transpo) because it\'s all stuck to this cover. It seems like even when velcro grazes the sock it latches INSTANTLY and DEEPLY. You have to be extremely deliberate about where your leash and other velcro components are when dealing with this cover.It\'s a small complaint and some folks won\'t care, but it\'s annoying enough that I\'m considering swapping it out for yet another hemp sock.\n', ""\n  Now that Stevie got these socks in stock in 10'6 i grabbed one for a vintage log.  Glad I bought from Stevie, and here is why;1.  Padded nose is key.2.  Sock material has good thickness to it.  This is critical because when you're carrying a giant heavy board you hit stuff.  No joke things I have hit include my kid (she was 2....), garage door, car in garage, garage track, ceiling in garage....they go on. the thick padding will protect both the board from marks, and my kid from the board3. Sock is a good size.  Takes board easy, and the giant glassed on hatchet fin no problem.So protect your board, protect your kids, protect your car.....and you don't have to spend a lot of money doing it.  Well made and very happy this board now has protection.\n"", ""\n  Money well spent. Quality board sock for a small price. This is a necessity if you every strap boards to the roof, place them in your car or in your truck bed. No matter how you travel to the surf, this board sock will protect your board. I throw my sticks in a van, before I had the board sock I would get wax all over my fabric. It's comes out but it's tough to clean.The product is made of a durable fabric and the top black fabric is more protection for the nose. You will find a Velcro pouch on the inside, I use it for wax. You will also find the tail end has a draw string to secure it on the board.I'm giving it a 5 star because it is a quality productCons:1) my Amazon prime shipping was late. Boo hoo, I went three extra days without a sock, I'm over it2) I have a 9'4 Starr 3 stringer, I ordered a 9'6 sock and it fit perfectly. This 9'6 sock will not fit my 9'6 infinity cluster V. I will need to order a 2nd sock of bigger size to fit my 9'6 long board.3) I have multiple FCS 2 fins so removing the fins isn't a hassle, just wish the sock had a pouch to place them in. Same goes for the leash. I keep my leash connected to my board because I am lazy and the whole thing is transported in a van. It would be nice if the sock had something I could wrap my leash around to look more organized. For now I stuff it into the sock with the board.Overall:Excellent product, ask questions about sizing before you purchase. The sock stretches but not a whole lot. If you have a thin board, order to size. If you have a thick board, order a size bigger.\n"", ""\n  I've got all types of socks and took a shot on a pair of these for new boards to save a cpl $. They're not bad, main difference from the big surf brands (FCS, Creatures, etc.) is the seam. These socks have a seam in the sock part up the full length and the other brands have a knit tube that has no seam except where the nose cover attaches. These socks are also a little less protection as the knit fabric is a bit thinner then the big brands and the nose cover is also not as padded.These are major differences, but you can feel the difference just handling covered boards.\n"", '\n  Its not intended to be left in the sun, or hot car, or protect your board from dings. Storage and transport (not getting wax in/on your car, or other boards) is what its good for. The knit fabric works best and dries quick. This is better than that cheapy $15 to $20 bags with material that you use to clean your glasses with. Highly recommended and I will purchase more.\n', '\n  This is the best protection you can do for your board if you weren’t going to buy a bag for it. It’s stylish, and it’s soft, but just the right amount of protection when even keeping it in your garage. Of course I’ll always recommend getting a bad if you have the funds, but having this is pretty handy. It covers my board plus a little more and has a small pouch to hold wax, fin keys and screwdrivers if you need it.\n', '\n  I bought this because my local surf shop is closed due to the pandemic.The colors are nice.  The pocket for wax and stuff is a nice touch.It is a good surfboard sock.After a while, it stretched out to fit around my board.\n', '\n  My son need a sock for his board and I was looking around Amazon and I found Ho Stevie! …..The Board Sock works and fits great...very important to keep the board covered during transport as the sun will yellow the board...very happy with the sock and will be buying more for all of his boards\n']"
