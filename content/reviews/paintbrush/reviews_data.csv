The artist in our family is quite pleased with these brushes and especially loves that the case stands :)\n', '\n  I’ve  been doing paint by number for a while now.  7 pictures so far.The paint brushes they give you with those kits are okay for what they are, but the handles are thin and if you use a bunch of different colors in one session, you run out quick.There are a lot of detail brushes out there and they are a mixed bag.  This set was pretty decent.  What I’m looking for in a set for Paint by Number are:**** Ergonomic handle with a grip**** Shorter brushes that don’t bed a lot**** Narrow pointed brushes5 of these 7 were perfect for the detailed part of paint by number and the broader one will come in handy for larger fill in areas. The really long narrow one is bit too flexible on paint by number for my full control of it. But 6 out of 7 works for me.\n', ""\n  I've been painting alot of rocks getting ready for our spring gardens (did you know to paint small rocks red and place them in your strawberry patch BEFORE your strawberries set fruit?  The birds will grow tired of pecking at the red rocks and go away leaving your fruit alone - or so that's the theory I'm testing this summer!) because I use rocks as markers for which type of plants I'm growing, such as a bright metallic yellow pear shaped rock signifies my yellow pear tomato plant or a rock painted to resemble a sunflower is my sunflower patch and a rock with a green bean is well... you get the idea :-)These brushes are terrific to hold, love the extra wide grip and they are perfect for detail work.  Definitely recommend!\n"", ""\n  It's hard to find good detail brushes that don't break the bank, so it's a real pleasure to find a set of them at an affordable price. There isn't a thing I don't like about these, although I have only used them with watercolors and acrylics.They seem to be very well-made; the ferrules are sturdy and crimped securely to the handle, which is is made of wood and doesn't feel insubstantial at all. In addition to the nice weight the handles have a very smooth finish and assume a tri-corn shape in the grip area, which aids in control of the brush and helps relieve the hand fatigue that can come with painting extensive detail work. The bristles are nylon and hold paint very well. They are flexible yet stiff enough to hold the line you paint with them. Even the longest of the rounds is soft and flexible, yet goes where you direct it.These wash up nicely (remember to keep the water out of the ferrule while they dry) and I have not had any problem with the bristles splaying after use or washing. I am careful to replace them in their plastic sheaths to ensure they keep their shape. With proper care, I am counting on these brushes to last me many years. They're wonderful for a hobbyist or a student painter and I highly recommend them.\n"", ""\n  This is a set of 7 art/hobby detail brushes.  They are not the highest quality brushes I have ever used, but they should be satisfactory for most detail painting work.  The handles are dark brown finished wood and are fairly comfortable to hold and use.  The bristles are nylon and are held securely by metal ferrules.  Some trimming may be necessary on a few of the brushes, as the bristles are not quite uniform in length.  The bristles are easy to clean and maintain their points reasonably well.  For the price (currently $7.47 on Amazon), you really can't go wrong with this set of brushes.\n"", '\n  I got these for my wife.  She is an artist and some times is in need of a quality fine tip.Pros:- 12 Different Fine Tip Brushes- Wood Handles- Nylon Bristles- Sturdy- Strong- PreciseCons:- NoneWhat you get in the package:- 12 Different Fine Tip BrushesWhat my wife likes about these brushes is the sturdy fine points.  She says they really help to make intricate and precise strokes in her favorite medium .. acrylic paint.  The brushes have large grabs areas near the tips of the paint brush that assist in a good hold and accurate placement of the tip.All in all, my wife was very pleased with this set.  They are fine tips and she says that for the price these are hard to beat.This product is made in China.\n', '\n  These AmazonBasics paint brushes are great for painting miniatures and are reasonably priced. They work well for base paint, details, washing, and dry brushing, and the range of sizes from small to tiny is just right for Warhammer 40K. The triangular grips are comfortable and offer good control, though they do take a little getting used to if you are used to basic round handles. So far these have proven durable when used with Citadel paints. This is a nice set of brushes for anyone trying to make their chaos space marines look their best, and they come in an attractive, sturdy box that makes them suitable for gift giving.\n', '\n  Per il prezzo pagato non ci si può lamentare anche se spendendo poco più ho trovato di meglio.Il mio compagno usa questo tipo di pennelli per dettagli nel modellismo ed ha notato che sono meno resistenti e perdono più presto il pelo rispetto ad altre marche precedentemente provate.Spedizione Amazon veloce.\n', ""\n  The majority of my paint brushes are cheap and damaged so I was hyped when I got these and they're actually great. The wooden handles are smooth, there’s no risk of getting splinters, they’re thick and unsnappable, and they’re heavy considering it’s a paintbrush (which makes it comfortable to hold and easier to control). The bristles are synthetic which is important to me because I don’t like using animal hair and by the way these are remarkably soft! I couldn’t believe they’re synthetic because ironically they’re softer than my cat's fur.The bristles differ in length but it's not noticeable on most of the paint brushes unless it's for precise painting. They shedded a little at first so hopefully it won't keep happening. I'm really happy with them baring in mind I only paint as a hobby so I'm not sure if they're good enough for anything professional.\n"", ""\n  This set is absolutely ideal for when you need to be extremely precise with your painting - realism, light and dark, highlights - but what is so good about them is their ergonomics - the shape of the handle makes them so easy to handle and you can give a light touch very easily to a particular part of your painting.The difference in sizes is clearly marked on the handles and the precision you can get when wielding these is amazing - so lightweight, bristles are soft and yet sturdy. They are ideal for all sorts of media - the bristles don't fall out easily - so they are good for oils, acrylics and watercolours.These are great value and yet essential to any artist's studio!\n"", ""\n  Pour peindre des détails ces pinceaux sont idéaux.l'ergonomie est bien respectée avec les côtés écrasés qui facilitent la prise en main et le placement des doigt.Les pinceaux ne perdent pas leurs poils qui restent bien groupés sans partir dans tous les sens.\n"", ""\n  A set of 7 art paint Brushes.I like how they have a shaped handle to them so they feel comfortable when doing son detailed work.They have been easy to clean.The look a better quality judt with the handle detail.Came in a plain amazon white box.

I usually get the sub $1 brushes at the hardware store because after I use them I basically toss them, I don't want to go through the hassle of cleaning them and those cheap brushes are usually ruined after you clean them anyways.So I have no experience with high end brushes, but I found these to be really good for the price. I actually bothered cleaning them a couple of time although for the price it's worth buying a new set for each painting project.They hold their bristles pretty well even after washing.

This is our third home we've owned so I have painted a lot over the years and have used a good variety of brushes. For the price, these are phenomenal!!They aren't perfect, a few bristles come out when you are washing and if you are edging out a whole room they tend to get a little goopy by the end. By that I mean, they accumulate paint on them and the paint dries a bit as you're going along so by the end of the room you need to use a little finesse to see that your edge is still clean and straight. Though, that said, you get 5 brushes!! So if you are finding it difficult to get a straight edge because of the brush getting full of paint, just grab a fresh brush.I find cleaning them easy. Whatever the bristles are made from cleans off easily with a small bit of soap and water. Aside from the few bristles coming out I have no real complaints. I have washed them all multiple times already and they are still in great shape. These will definitely suffice to get me through all my house painting and I believe they will hold up long beyond.I would absolutely purchase these again and I would also highly recommend them.\n"", ""\n  If you are reading this, you are probably a cheapo too. I bought three sets of cheap paint brush sets off Amazon. Hint: the other two are on either side of this one on the Amazon lineup it compares it to. This one is the best of the lot because it has a decent amount of bristles and they are fine tipped so they don't leave too many brush marks. That being said, for big, critical jobs I go back to the Wooster and Purdy professional brushes, as manufacturing a top notch paint brush is an art. Even then, they don't make brushes like they used to.The problem with the other cheap sets is they skimp on the bristles, which are polyester (basically plastic). This really gets annoying if you are painting over an old wall where there are bare wood in conjunction with several layers of old paint. You will encounter a lot of tiny cracks and pinholes, or you have to slide paint under the edges of an old coat of paint. With high quality brushes, the high bristle count holds paint in reservoir, so if you have to fill in the imperfections, you just press harder on the brush and it milks the paint out to fill the holes, then you just go over it lightly the blend it in. These cheaper brush sets with low bristle count will run out of paint to do this, no matter how hard you press the brush down or bend the bristles. You are forced to dip it back into the can of paint. The more you do this, you lose time, and you have more chances of paint drops falling off the brush on your finish, etc.Another problem with the low brush count is it leaves visible paint strokes, so you have to go back over the area again with another coat of paint. In addition, the low bristle count won't hold paint as well, so you have more problems with paint dripping off the brush after you dip it in the can. Get a really good, high bristle count (preferably hog hair) brush with fine strand tips for feathering the finish so you won't leave brush marks, and you will know what I mean. But if you don't want to drop $35 for a single paint brush, then this cheap brush set will get you by.\n"", ""\n  I bought this without reading any of the reviews because I just needed paintbrush cheap and quick, but after I ordered and was waiting for it to be delivered, I figured I may as well look at the reviews and what I saw made me regret buying it.

Not for kids, not for beginners, not for professionals. DO NOT RECOMMEND.\n', '\n  A nice variety of smaller sizes and, if you keep them clean, they will last quite a while. I actually bought them as one-use throwaways, but have yet to throw one away.\n', '\n  The brushes are very stiff. I don’t see how you would be able to use them for watercolor or any fine art work. I bought them for general use in my metalsmith studio for applying liquid fluxes, patinas and firecoats. They may be a little stiff for some work but I am hoping they soften up with use. Might work well for heavy handed children’s use.\n', '\n  I needed these brushes for a small project and didn’t want to spend to much but wow the brushes hold paint without having any drips, which was important that my black trim not get on the white. Plus the brushes didn’t fray or feather out so i had nice smooth lines..\n', '\n  I thought this was a very good product for a 2 hour make-and-take class that I conducted.  It provided many size options to meet the needs of the students and the bristles cleaned out quickly and easily so as to move right along to the next color, etc.  However, I must say that after only about 4 or 5 rinses, the water apparently saturated the handle enough to make the blue start to flake off and that became very irritating to a lot of students as it sometimes got into their project area.  I would recommend being very careful in the washing clean process so as not to get too much water on the handles.\n', ""\n  I always buy these brushes. I am pretty rough when I paint, so I don't bother buying the really expensive ones. These are really great because they last a fair amount (especially the large ones, I haven't had to replace those at all, just the smaller ones) for the price and have a variety of tip types. A very good deal.\n"", '\n  Was the nicest painting I have done, loved the depth of it.  Had many compliments on it.  My husband’s favourite.\n', '\n  work well, keep their form, hold paint well, comfort is good.  i would recomend to purchase\n', '\n  I like these brushes and use them often, i do prefer a longer handle for most painting but  these come in handy for those little areas I need to do.  They have washed up very well and so far no loss of hairs.  Definitely worth the $\n', '\n  Great value, smooth application and lots of different size options. My kids love these brushes and so do! Easy to clean and still lots of use left after every clean. I will be stocking up on these brushes\n', '\n  These are ok but not of great quality. They were very inexpensive and you do get what you pay for.\n']"

Purchased a couple sets of these and gave 1 a try the next day and was very surprised , just as good if not better than the big name brushes, actually holds more paint and clean cut lines. Will definatly be ordering more sets.\n', ""\n  If you are looking to replace your professional paint brushes I'd stay away. There are nowhere near enough bristles per brush to get the desired effect you are wanting.If you are needing some paint brushes for a job or two every now and then, then these are much better suited to you. After I apply paint with my brush, I take a foam roller or foam mini roller and smooth out my paint.  It leaves an almost spray painted finish which I have grown to love. Because of this, I've discovered I don't need as high quality of a paint brush, I just need one that I can get the paint on with, cut some decent lines, and is easy to clean. This is exactly what these paint brushes do.\n"", ""\n  I was somewhat hesitant to buy this set of brushes but took a chance based on price and reviews. Am so happy I did!! I took on a big project (big for me being disabled) ..these brushes rock!! For the low price to have such a high quality... have been using the 3 inch brush all day and this is making my task so much easier. I couldn't be more tickled!! Thank you for a very well made product that doesn't break the bank!\n"", '\n  For price quality is great. 4 different sizes, brushes do not shed. I prefer to throw brush away after project is finished, so this is a good deal. I switched from one color of paint to lighter one and washed the brush. Cleaned easily and no paint transfer.\n', ""\n  I used these brushes for four different paint jobs, including latex and water based stain, and have had excellent luck. The photos (attached) are after doing some extensive touch up on rough stucco.  I was expecting to only get one or two uses from these, but have been happy with how well they have been holding up.  They seem to work well for interior wall and exterior surfaces. The edges are soft for a smooth finish.  They would be a little streaky for furniture or fine woodwork trim (I would also use an expensive brush for those type of applications).  The bristle material seems a little different than other plastic brushes, and the one con I found is that the don't hold the paint as good, and maybe are more prone to dripping.\n"", ""\n  The brush has fine bristles at the tip and very stable and retains its wedge shape during painting. The paint flows better than the comparable price at Harbor Freight. You won't see any wayward bristle coming out of the pack.  I also use it for painting ceiling to wall corners without the need for masking and it creates a neat edge lines. You can't beat the price for the quality you're getting. I'll buy another set for my future project. I'm not sure how much life I can get out of these brushes but time will tell and I will report it when I reach that point.\n"", '\n  Finally a good brush, my wife and I paint signs for a hobby and have gone through many of store bought brushes, but none of them were as quality and streak-free as Bates Brush. For the price it’s an easy choice.\n', '\n  I’ve ordered several of these and have never been disappointed! They last forever and can handle a lot of tough heavy duty painting and the angled ones are awesome for getting the tough edging areas, plus they clean really well! These are by far the best paint brushes ever and the price is unbelievable. I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on good name brand paint brushes and these don’t even compare. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND them!\n']"
