I’ve always been an Otter box fan but I didn’t like the chunkiness of their clear case. We decided to order these and we would return them if we didn’t like them. Well we kept them, and I’m so happy we did. My daughter has the clear OtterBox catchy and when you put them side-by-side this one is just so much more elegant.But here’s the important thing, does it actually protect the phone? Well I’m a professional phone dropper. If only someone would pay me for it I’d be rich. I drop it all the time on the ground in the car, in the kitchen, pretty much everywhere. The screen protector has yet to crack up and there’s enough of a lip around the edge Of both the front and the back that the camera is protected and the screen is protected. I’m really happy with this case.\n', '\n  This case is almost exactly what I was looking for! I wanted a crystal clear case to show off the color of my new iPhone, but didn’t want to spend nearly $40 on an Apple branded case. This case not only offers crystal clearness, but also offers protection  Apple cases I have had in the past don’t protect my phone very well. This case also doesn’t have raised corners on the backside like some do, which is something I didn’t want. It comes with 4 pieces - The front bumper, the full body case, and two screen protectors. I didn’t use a protector because I have one coming in the mail, but I placed one on my screen to show you how well it fits. It’s designed for you to put on the case and then the protector, so you can accurately place the protector. It also isn’t too bulky, but still feels like it’s protecting my phone really well. I would highly recommend this case.Update: Unfortunately, it doesn’t fit with my ZAGG screen protector. This is the only downside to this case.\n', ""\n  This case is so chic. It is crystal clear. The screen protector went on EFFORTLESSLY with no bubbles. This offers full body protection with no part of the phone uncovered aside from the speaker ear piece at the top of the phone. It's also a great value seeing as you get 2 screen protectors. I will definitely be using the vendor for all my phone protection needs. The value CANNOT be beat!\n"", '\n  It’s hard to put into words how much I truly love this case. I have a horrible time finding a case that not only slides in and out of my back pocket without getting caught up, but isn’t so slim and slick that I’m constantly dropping it (as I do when there is no case on my phone, which is often, since I hate most of the cases I try). This case is perfect.It’s absolutely crystal clear and both the front ridged bumper piece and the slightly more flexible back cover piece are flawless and quite sturdy.I had no issues at all with installing the case and the screen protector went on gorgeously. For someone with massive OCD when it comes to alignment and imperfect areas/edges, this is huge. And it comes with 2! I’m able to type just fine with the screen protector on, which I can be a real snob over.I have a card holder adhered to the back of the case, which seems to be working super well.Overall, I’m crazy impressed. I’ll only be back to review if somehow this god worthy case takes a crazy turn for the worst, which is highly unlikely.\n', '\n  This case is pretty legit. I have the white iPhone 11 and I’m not the best with applying screen protectors and I was definitely skeptical about the easiness of putting the 3 part case on it but it was extremely easy and both came on perfectly. Took me just a few minutes as well. I was afraid of breaking the front frame but reading the directions saying to remove it from bottom to top first AND watching the video helped a lot.  The case fits on perfectly and I don’t have to worry about my phone slipping out of my grasp anymore.  Very impressed and happy with the product, I recommend.\n', '\n  really high quality feel, doesn’t seem cheaply made at all and really does feel protective. the hard part of the case goes in on the screen edges up to the edge of the screen protector and edges are thick and very protective. case is a bit hard to get off though, especially if you don’t have nails or help. still an amazing purchase, way better than any other case i’ve had and i used to spend loads of money on otterboxes and life cases but this one is the best in quality and price.\n', '\n  I love this case. It has a good weight to it and it is not slick. The iPhone 11 without a case I is very slick. I dropped it all the time. With this case, I can hang on to my phone! And I love that it comes in clear. My red can still show!\n', '\n  Just received item today, Love the fast shipping ! So far seems like a good case I like that it’s clear so I am able to see the color of my phone. Installation was a snap the case itself is two pieces a former plastic that goes around the edges of the phone and then a flexible plastic that covers the sides and back. Also comes with two glass screen protectors. I think it’s a good price for both case and protectors. So far I like it.  Will have to wait and see how well it lasts.\n', '\n  S.O.\n']"

When I received this case I thought it was a mistake because it was very thin! Finally I have a case where I don\'t have to worry if I drop it on the back or sides and it fits perfectly with my wrap around screen protector so my phone is completely covered. The only drawback of the case is that the back is transparent but its tinted black so my red IPhone 11 doesn\'t completely shine but that\'s a super minor thing compared to how good this case it. Honestly writing about these phone cases makes me sound like a bot programmed to write these reviews or someone who works for the company but they\'re just that great! The customer service was amazing (as always) and I\'m extremely satisfied with my overall experience!\n', '\n  Great Case. Fits very well, protects hole phone. Has nice design. Can be seen apple logo on back side. Is screen protector friendly.\n', '\n  Fantastic IPhone 11 cover.  Although the edges are a bit thicker i a better protection than other Torras’s coves I experienced; I still really like this one. It still feels lightweight . smooth but not slippery or bulky. Love the fact the back of the cover it’s kind of see through and able to see the color of the of the phone and Apple logo. It does protect the cámara as well and this one fit to perfection and no issues with the volume, lock and mute buttons alignments.Also love the packaging presentation always everything come very neat and their customer service so far has been excellent with any questions about there products.\n', '\n  Fits well; grips easily. Seems to work as well as covers that cost much more.\n', '\n  I\'m happy with this case. I was looking for a case that was durable and would be easier to take in and out of my jacket pocket. I had a silicone case and that served me for at least a year and it was starting to fall apart. One case was too slippery and the ""silicone"" lining on the case was also slippery. The other didn\'t seem too durable.This is simple and fits the criteria I had setting out.\n', '\n  This case is beautiful, the matte black looks and feels amazing. The side bumpers provide total coverage without hindering the button response. The camera is not obstructed by the thickness of the case. The back is a frosted hard plastic, but feels  velvety smooth.  Will repurchase this brand with every new phone.\n', '\n  It has the same sleek design as the other Torras cases. It is sturdier and I can tell it adds extra protection to the phone no doubt. For me personally though it is rather big, particularly the lip that extends above the screen. I waited quite some time to upgrade to the 11 as I was hesitant that it would be bulky. I do have big hands but there is something about the user experience of moving your finger over the screen seamlessly. Overall its a great case and I can see the benefits for those that have a job or activity that exposes the phone to a greater risk of dropping it.\n', '\n  Better than I ever expected! I was not too excited for this case but needed something that would not get so dirty when I work. Handling packages all day at UPS, my hands get very dirty so my phone cases  don’t last long. This case was durable and extremely smooth to the touch. It’s not new favorite case.\n', ""\n  \xa0Whenever you need a strong protective case you find yourself compromising on how it looks and feels in your hand. I've been there, you've been there. Well, those days are over! This case doesn't compromise at all. With a very soft matte finish, it still provides military grade protection.The thing that I like about this case is its translucent back which shows the original phone logo.The lanyard hook can offer extra bling for to your phone, but also can offer extra protection if you want to attach it to your belt for example.The matte finish provides a cool look while also being very soft and offering a strong protection. Doesn't look bulky, doesn't feel bulky.Choosing this case was a no brainer, glad I did it.\n"", '\n  The case feels amazing. It has this suede smooth material which is so nice to hold. The fitting of the phone is perfect.Packaging was also great with no damages to anything which I normally find when ordering other cases.Great value for money.The back is slightly transparent so you can still see the Apple logo at the back which is a nice subtle touch.\n', ""\n  The Torras iPhone 11 case is a great product, certainly as reliable and worthy as some cases on the market that will set you back £30-£40. I was looking for a case that wouldn't detract from the design and look of the iPhone 11, as well as being compact enough to fit in my pocket and would also give me peace of mind in terms of protection for the phone. The Torras does not disappoint and exceeded my expectations. I bought the translucent case which displays the Apple logo beautifully-a great touch. The sales department are really friendly and reliable and delivery was swift. I can't recommend them enough. If you are looking for a case for your iPhone-buy Torras!\n"", ""\n  I recently purchased a new iPhone 11 and wanted a decent/protective cover - i initially purchased a clear TORRAS cover which was fine, but then TORRAS released this product which arrived today. Looks great on the phone and looks/feels sturdy - I've not dropped the phone yet and do not intend to, but the cover looks like it would cope well. The latest cover complements my phone well, as I have a black iPhone and looks better than the previous clear option....\n"", ""\n  Looks VERY stylish on, - like if Apple ever provided a screen case in the box with their iphone it wouldnt look too dissimilar to this.Feels solid and precision made, yet doesn't add that bulky feeling . Very impressed with the smoothness of the case in the hand and how it limits grubby fingerprints. Works fantastic with my screen protector too. Nice seeing the apple logo through the back too.\n""]"

Thankfully no damage to the phone...yet, but very disappointed that I now have the potential to worry about damage to my phone.

I’m sure it remains durable and protective, which is why I’m keeping it (though I had to get it replaced through amazon once as the clicking in the upper right hand side was awful). Amazon’s customer service has been fantastic as ever.I will not, however, be buying the same model when it comes time to replace the case. I may even move away from Otterboxes, because I’m disappointed with the current quality for what is a fairly premium price.\n', '\n  I have used OtterBox Defenders with my mobile telephones for many years and this latest edition is as good as any the company have produced.  Initially I was a little reticent regarding a ‘screen less’ edition but when combined with a first class screen protector it allows for easier operation without sacrificing first class defence against accidents.\n']"

The case fits perfectly without any play or sloppiness. The case is a cross between flexible and sturdy yet feels soft and grippy on your fingers. The case also has little bumper guards on the corners to help if you accidentally drop your phone. There is also a raised edge to help protect the screen and camera lens. I would certainly buy this again if necessary. A clear case at the Apple store that is not as high-quality was $40.\n', '\n  Bought this case for my iPhone 11 not knowing whether it would fit and it does! Was worried the cameras would stick out significantly with the case on but they don’t, which is great! Case itself feels very sturdy, great for the price!\n', '\n  I like that it is crystal clear so I can see my new phone, but still have it protected. The buttons are covered with a thinner vinyl to protect against dirt and dust and are easy to use. The camera has a cut out so as to not block any view. For the price, you can’t ask for more!\n', ""\n  It's a simple clear case that is not bulky but definitely protects the phone from drops. I have already dropped my phone on concrete and the case did it's job without damaging the case or the phone. I am still able to see the beautiful design of the iphone without putting it at risk with no case.\n"", '\n  Sleek clear case, the logo is small on the side, and the front screen is protected.\n', '\n  I picked my new iPhone 11 at the T-Mobile store but didn’t like any of the cases they had in the store. I woke the next morning and went to pull my phone off the charging stand but with those aluminum rails it slipped right out of my hand and hit the floor!  😬I was relieved to see it landed on a padded edge of my bedroom rug and was unharmed.However I immediately went to Amazon and found this clear case to show off my purple (company/brand color) iPhone 11.The case was Amazon’s choice and so based their experience and knowledge I ordered the case and it arrived the next day.I don’t think I ever dropped my XR but I have dropped the 11 four times in the short time I have owned it. But thanks to this case it’s been protected and there has been no issues.The corners have some airspace padding which helps soften the blow upon impact. It’s thick enough where it even protects the cameras jutting out of the back. There’s also a lip on the display side to keep that from getting scratched or damaged when laid face down on the table. However it doesn’t feel bulky and add a lot of weight to the phone like those bulky expensive cases they sell in the carrier store. This is a great case at a great price. I can recommend this case without any reservations or misgivings.\n', '\n  Good color.  easy to hold .good package. Its not hard or not to soft its a little soft.\n', '\n  Not an anti shock risistance case\n', ""\n  Very welcome neat case as my phone was extremely slippery in my dry old fingers. Neat little case which doesn't detract from the design of the phone.No idea how durable it's going to be, hence the lack of a score but it seems sturdy enough and represents good value.\n"", '\n  This is a very well made, good quality case, it arrived quickly and it fits very well.\n', '\n  Great. Protective. Fits my iPhone 11 well. Delivery came before expected.\n', '\n  It’s perfect!!\n', '\n  No es la funda que venden\n']"

The good news is that the army green + orange color way looks good in person. It's also soft to the touch and seems to provide a modicum of protection for your $1500+ smart phone.The bad news is that the power and volume cutouts and button inserts are crooked. They just look crummy. And the speaker and Thunderbolt cutouts are oddly sharp, and they dig into your hand or fingers when you hold the phone. The way I see it, you're buying a case like this almost solely for aesthetics—so that's what I judge it on. It looks alright but it's very, very cheap. Adjust your expectations accordingly and you won't be too disappointed (and you'll have a phone case for alternate days/changing things up.)\n"", '\n  I’m loving the look and feel of this case.  It doesn’t add a bulky feeling, at all.  The area around the camera is covered very well, without interfering with the various styles of photos taken.  The buttons can be pressed with ease, and it has enough lip around the screen area to lay the phone face down.  The case works just fine with wireless charging, too.  I may consider buying some other colors.\n', ""\n  I started getting back into Pokemon GO and was looking for a new case that might be a little lighter and have better airflow for those hot phone batteries, and this was it! It is very light and sleek feeling kinda flies out your hand a bit if you aren't careful but over all is a nice cheap phone case with style. My only complaint is that the cut out for the charging port is kinda sharp. I don't know if it wears down after a while because it doesn't seem as sharp as it was but be careful if you get one like mine!\n"", ""\n  This case is exactly what you see. Light weight Great grip and unique but subtle style. The price is excellent. I've had this case for two months and I haven't experienced any color fading and it still fits like a glove from heavy use. Of course if you are prone to dropping your phone then this is the most effective protection but for me that it is great. Again throw that case in the cart and buy.\n"", ""\n  I saw a case similar to this on Instagram for $30+, so I decided to see if I could find something cheaper on Amazon. I couldn't be happier with this case! It is the perfect color to match my matte Midnight Green iPhone 11 Pro Max. Lightweight and the colors are great. I wouldn't purchase if you're looking for something super protective. I will definitely be ordering in other colors!\n"", '\n  This case fits like a glove. Color is true to advertisement. I can’t believe how much of a difference the holes make in letting the heat escape in turn keeping my phone noticeably cooler when I use it with the brightness maxed out for longer than 30 minutes at a time.  Buyer beware- if you stay on your phone for long periods of time NOTHING can prevent your phone from heating up except you giving your phone usage time a break.  That being said... don’t blame the heat from all day phone usage on the case not working. :)\n', ""\n  If you need a case to let some heat escape, this did it for me. I've really come to enjoy this case. I have now had it for a couple of months and it hasn't had any issues. I use my phone to game often, putting in a few hours easily at a time. With a solid case I could feel the heat building up on the back of my iPhone, with this case it is nowhere near as much. Is there still some heat... yeah, but I expect that after 3 straight hours of use.I would hands-down pick up another one of these cases if I ever needed to. I enjoy the black with red accents. I don't drop my phone a lot, I treat $800 devices carefully... so I have no idea how this holds up in a drop test, but I also don't intend on needing to find out.\n"", '\n  Light weight, good fit. I used my phone for work and gets hot while taking many videos and uploading to my company website sometimes while plugging into an External battery pack. My old case was tight and thicker and would trap heat and cause my phone to over heat on occasion.  This case allows the heat to escape much quicker.\n', '\n  Quality is very good, it has mat finish which look absolutely amazing and proper protection of camera bumper. Prices is bit high but if you can’t find in local market then it’s good option.\n']"
