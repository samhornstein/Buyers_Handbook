Replaced with CM 212 with MX-4, runs at 26-50 now.-Power Supply was a High Power 500W... I replaced with an old Corsair TX850W from a decade ago.

For Ram/Motherboard/GPU you open 1 Phillips screw and you pull up and remove the glass cover, so since this was my first time upgrading ram, I was scared I would break something but you only need to put ram in an angle locked into one of the tabs and push down and the ram is in from 8gb to 32gb. and storage, simply unplug the SATA and SATA Power Cable and screw out and take out the old and put the new in.

Took us a couple hours to trouble shoot this - hence 4 stars.  If you're not used to breaking apart a rig and putting it back together, you may have issues getting this going out of the box.  Customer service is only M-FSome things to note --This case is so tight they had to use liquid cooling.  There is no space for air flow.-This case is so tight you have to remove the power supply to access anything-This came with a 500w Bronze power supply.  Not modular, so the tight space has no room for cable management.-ITX motherboard - only 2 dimm slots for memory.  It comes with 1 8GB stick DDR4 2666-Has a traditional HD.  Who uses HD anymore?-No extra room for any other HD - None expansion-Due to the form factor of ITX no PCIe slots available for expansion+Has one M.2 slot available+decent HW for the price+no bloatwareAs of the writing of this review - the price of the video card alone GTX 1660 Super is $700.  So for an extra $150 you get the Mobo, CPU, Case, memory, liquid cooling, OS.  If you price this out this is a great value.  Granted the GTX1660 Super should only be a $200 GPU - due to COVID it's impossible to get your hands on so prices are unreasonably high.\n"", ""\n  I was so excited to use this, first gaming machine I bought since 03.

AMAAAAZING experience.Skytech, thank you for making my VR experience SO INCREDIBLY SMOOTH.  This experience made me realize that this is not GAMING;  IT IS TRAVEL.  Yes, humanity has mastered VR gaming/travel.  It is like having a STARGATE in your garage.  CRAZY!!!\n', ""\n  First time getting a gaming PC. Was nervous as hell. The package was huge. way bigger than i expected. Real easy to get started. I'm currently downloading ESO.  Will let you know how that plays. Don't hesitate buy it.\n"", '\n  I had the computer 3 hours and it quit, called Tech and left message no call back the next day, called again left message, again nothing, see the pattern! I opened up a new computer and fixed it myself (loose cable), Not a happy camper that I have to fix my own computer that I paid almost 800 for and they say several times to call them in there paperwork and , but on the plus sign the computer boots up fast, I play War Thunder and its so nice!Pros: Fast, Cool Looking, QuiteCons: NO Tech Support PERIOD!! also when I put it to sleep there is a blue LED on top that blinks and OMG its so bright it will keep you awake, so I had to put tape on it.\n', ""\n  Blazing fast powerhouse! Very nice real gaming computer. Boots up instantly, runs anything and everything with ease. Great buy and best bang for your buck. Cable management is awesome, looks amazing, very quiet fans. It actually looks 10x better in person, picture really doesn't do it justice. Only complaint is I purchased 2 Skytech computers recently and the RAM was wrong on both orders. One was missing an 8g stick and one was 2400 instead of 3000. Customer service made good on it with no problems.\n"", ""\n  Having a history of building my own PCs, I had some doubts about it being pre-built. But boy was I wrong. The PC arrived 3 days early which was an unexpected surprise. I opened the box and it took me about 5 min to plug in the single plug and turn it on, that and 10 min ogling over its components.  Starting the computer was mesmerizing, seeing the LED colors light up and the silent hum of the fans come to life.Now as far as gameplay goes, I have been playing all of my steam games for around 3 weeks now from low intensity platformers to mainstream FPSs, all of which I have maxed out the graphics and I have yet to see the frame rate drop below 30 fps. The 500SSD drive allows the computer to start within 20 seconds and normal computing and file finding is far faster than my old one.The only downside I have is that the complementary keyboard and mouse are pretty cheap feeling and are not the best quality. The mouse is trash and you won't really be able to play first person shooters with great accuracy, the sensitivity is way off. Also I had a bit of trouble turning the LED lights off on both of them even after the PC was turned off. There is also no manual for the keyboard so it took me a while to even know that it lit up. (its PrtSc), But hey, it's complementary.Overall, I would highly recommend this computer if you want a pretty nice gaming rig for fairly cheap. It's great for all  types of gaming and I will likely be buying from skytech again.\n"", ""\n  Pretty good but since I've used crappy computer most of my life when I finally got a decent pc I had no idea wtf to do with it.This runs MnB Warband on Max, Elite dangerous on max Daemon x Machina on max.Long story shortIt's a great computer no issue quick setup.\n"", '\n  Had this for a few months now. Works great Had some trouble getting sound to work but it was sorted out fairly easy by myself. great gaming computer. I would buy this again in a heart beat.\n', '\n  EL EQUIPO CUMPLE LAS ESPECIFICACIONES INDICADAS POR EL VENDEDOR Y HASTA EL MOMENTO FUNCIONA ADECUADAMENTE\n']"

Case is great for airflow and filters on vents. Its a frame for a better gaming system but the MB requires changing almost immediately. My last ground up build was 10+ years old, (having sat unused for 8 years of that time) by now so I had a major overhaul and only kept my 10 year old ""future proofed"" power supply.Pros:-VC good enough -> came with a ASRock RX5500XT 4G.-CPU Great -> did come with a Ryzen 3600-Case layout and components are no frills but very well designed no idea name but plenty of RGB (too much for an adult)Cons:-Out of Box ASRock A320 Motherboard had pin temp (VRM I think could not diagnose location) showing 120deg C (115-121) with multiple hardware monitoring programs. Had to replace the MB to avoid a fire (at those temps chips burn quick chips usually rated for 5 yr @ 100 deg c, at 121 deg Arrhenius Equation tells you you\'ll likely have a problem soon). I replaced with a X570 AORUS, all temps less than 50 deg including VRM.-CPU Fan Sucked out of Box - the included CPU fan was a no name el cheapo unit loud and bad at cooling 50-75 deg C all the time... wish it came with the AMD Wraith, it does not. Replaced with CM 212 with MX-4, runs at 26-50 now.-Power Supply was a High Power 500W... I replaced with an old Corsair TX850W from a decade ago. My first thought to troubleshoot the hot WB was the PSU being bad.-Ram ADATA 8G 2333 single stick out of the box... It\'s a waste of the CPU and GPU to run it without dual channel -> instead got 2x16g Team Dark Z 3200.... Ran much smoother.\n', '\n  The Q+ A says it will handle ANY of the modern Call of Duty games - no shot - took it out of the box and started downloading warzone. Halfway through it told me storage was full. Was told I could purchase more memory/storage. How does a gaming pc not handle a game that my 6yr old ps4 can with zero problems. 100% disappointed. Someone tell me if I’m doing something wrong?\n', '\n  Update: Graphics Failed and could not be fixed at geek squad! Would have been good.Returned, what a dissapointment!Original Review:So this computer is so beautiful. I installed 32gb of corsair RGB pro ram and 1tb SSD. I also like how easy it is to get inside the pc and upgrade the ram, in the back panel, there are 2 Phillips screws for the SSD and another 2.5"" slot for another SSD/HDD and Power Supply. For Ram/Motherboard/GPU you open 1 Phillips screw and you pull up and remove the glass cover, so since this was my first time upgrading ram, I was scared I would break something but you only need to put ram in an angle locked into one of the tabs and push down and the ram is in from 8gb to 32gb. and storage, simply unplug the SATA and SATA Power Cable and screw out and take out the old and put the new in. So for a first timer, this is easier than I expected. So I don\'t like how the stock 240gb SSD died on me but I upgraded it!\n', '\n  This is a good pc  I got it for my kid  and  bought some Corsair DDR4  2x8 sticks of 3200 MHz ram and a evo 1tb  970 ssd m.2 driver and store all the games on there runs cod coldwar and battle royal games good you .  I spent $245 extra for the ram and ssd but you will need it the to run cod Cold War as it uses a lot of spaceAnd one more thing my motherboard didn’t have a screw for the ssd driver so it’s just sitting in there not secured down until I get my random computer screws in the mailsUpdate:::). Had this over a month and no complaints what so ever me and my kid are always on this pc and he loves it I highly recommend this pc it’s a good mid range pc as long as you add the ssd for games it also runs smother and faster and don’t forget 2x8 total 16 gigs of ram that’s all you need to play games you don’t need 32 gigs hope this helps someone\n', ""\n  Very impressed so far. Everything from the cables to the keyboard and mouse, to the quality of the hardware, to the ease of unboxing and set up. Couldn't be happier.\n"", '\n  The drive is small.  But the rest and that cavernous case makes for a brilliant base and go forward project.  I have had a Lenovo C660 on the desk for several years because company gear elsewhere.  Times have changed.I like to game and run business and video apps seamlessly.  DCS and War Thunder run like butter on near ultimate settings.  I need a wicked monitor.So pleased.  Like buying a perfect NA Miata or a stripped MK6 GTI or maybe a rust free mid year BMW 2002 and now I get to first learn everything about it and how it works but then am so confident that I can build further and enjoy\n', ""\n  I had been pricing out a new build, but it has been years since I've built a system and was a bit wary that I might mess something up. No reason for this since I've built several systems in my day.For the cost, I felt this was a great option. Only slightly more than the components would have cost me, with plenty of upgrade options in the future (motherboard compatibility mainly.)I did immediately swap out the smallish SSD for a TB m.2. Migration was smooth with Macrium. I've unplugged the shipped drive and left it in the case. Should the m.2 fail, I can be up and running again in a few minutes.It's been a few weeks and I haven't had any complaints.\n"", '\n  I’m certainly not a hard-core gamer, so I looked around for a few months pricing out gaming computers that were better than entry level but not pro level.  There wasn’t anyone on the internet or local store that could beat the price with the same equipment that this computer came with.  It was a homerun for sure.  It is a sweet computer.  My only issue was that I could not find where to install the SATA data drive that I purchased.  The box and wiring are so clean, it was hard to determine.  I pull the side off opposite the glass and found the HD mounts in the bottom inside the power supply container.  It was hard to see originally since the power cables were also stuffed in this area too.  This entire setup and price are a homerun for sure!!\n', '\n  Shopped around quite abit and found this to be the best value for what I need, I use it for day trading and streaming and it runs great. No bloatware which was nice, the polychrome app is finicky and opens once and agter that i have to restart to get it to open. I tried emailing and calling ibuypower but no answer or response, would recommend\n', '\n  good value for the money, looks nice too\n', '\n  \xa0La compré para un amigo y llegó todo sin problemas, eso sí el paquete era la caja que mostraba lo que era por lo que no dudo que le haya dado tentación a alguien.La computadora cumplió casa una de las espectativas de uso para streaming y gaming ligero\n', '\n  Prende la pc pero no me da señal en el monitor¿Alguien que me ayude?\n']"
