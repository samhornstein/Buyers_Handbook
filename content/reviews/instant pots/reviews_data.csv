I got my first pressure cooker in 1974. That\'s a long enough time to allow the development of strong opinions. I had an Instant Pot and loved it. My opinion of ihe Instant Pot Duo Crisp is that it\'s a piece of junk which has no place in a serious kitchen.The control panel is unreadable unless you bend down and look straight at it; this is an annoyance but easily fixable with a Sharpie. The pressure cooker works fine. It was better once I learned that the quick release lock cannot be engaged while the lid is on the cooker. The saute function works fine, as long as you stir the food to keep it from sticking on the hot spots. The air fryer basket is very poorly designed: if you use both levels, you cannot turn food over on the bottom tier without removing the top rack, and the top rack is designed to spill its contents all over the counter when it is removed.  It would have been really helpful if there was any information in the manuals about how much oil to use. Just saying ""uses less oil"" is meaningless.  It took over 30 minutes to \'air-fry\' 12 chicken wings starting with fully-thawed, refrigerated meat.The sous vide never got above 140F, when it was set to 200F. Same with the slow cooker; it gets just warm enough to breed salmonella cultures.I have not and will not try out the roast, bake, or broil functions because I expect that would only result in me having to salvage or discard ingredients. The user manual guidelines are completely useless for these functions.The user manual was obviously written for someone who cannot remember for five minutes that CAUTION: Pressure Cookers Get Hot! and has to be told every time that the appliance won\'t work if it\'s not plugged in.These are the most significant complaints I have about this artifact. I will be discarding it as soon as I can afford a different pressure cooker.Learn from my mistakes, fellow cooks.\n', '\n  I purchased this item after hearing everyone in my office talk about how much they love their instant pot or air fryer. So, I figured this would be the best of both worlds. After receiving the unit I realized that the majority of my needs would be for the air fryer. So I started making chicken fingers and french fries. After a few uses I noticed that the air fryer basket (which is coated in non-stick material, a toxic chemical) had a bunch of places where the non stick coating was missing. Upon further inspection I noticed it is chipping off and was most likely consumed by me while eating my chicken fingers.  This is terrifying and I immediately reached out to the manufacturer, who told me they will ship me a replacement when they have one. I have waited over a month and this monstrosity of a kitchen appliance just sits on my counter taking up a ton of space. I wrote into Instant pot again and they offered me a modest discount a second instant pot product. Stay away from this product for air frying, it may have harmful effects on your health. Also, it has a large footprint and it comes with two big tops, so make sure you have the room for storing it.\n', '\n  Update:After 1.5 months of daily use, I have to say this is the best cooking device I’ve ever used. Everything works just as advertised. If you have to buy only one thing for your kitchen, this is it. I increased the rating to 4, 1 off because of the horrible airfryer basket issue described below. If you need a replacement for the basket, look up on amazon the “air fryer replacement basket 3.7qt for power gowise usa air fryer”. I read a review saying that it fits the instant pot duo crisp so I bought it and yeah it does. I’ve used that one constantly for a month without a single scratch. This is my real experience, not paid review.I like instant pot a lot but I gotta say the airfryer basket is such a disappointment. I only used wooden tools and soft sponge with it but after only 2 wash the basket already got scratched. There’s another bigger scratch than the one shown here but I’m too lazy to take a new photo. I asked the customer service but they pointed me to Amazon seller (after sending them all photos and details) which provides information to basically tell me to contact Instant Pot again. Great machine, bad basket, not impressed with customer service so far.\n', '\n  I was so excited to buy this product.  It had been on my ""saved for later"" list for a long time.  I was especially excited because it was an 11 in one product.  It was a bit bigger than I wanted, but it was the only one that was an 11 in one product.  Before I arrived I had printed out at least 50 recipes to try.  My first disappointment was that some of the accessories that came with it, clearly were meant for a smaller model, and when I brought it to the attention of the seller they asked for a whole lot of things that a non tech savy senior citizen was in no position to do.Then, I was disappointed when the cooking surface was so small.  It was an 8 quart instant pot but the cooking surface was clearly no bigger than a 4 quart.  They clearly went UP rather than out as they increased capacity.My final disappointment was when it would not property pressurize and when half of the control panel functions wouldn\'t work.  I returned it.  I cook a lot and I am going back to the tried and true methods.\n']"

Making my dogs food was so easy! I put in the food and the water, pressed pressure cook and like magic it was just done when it beeped.  Getting used to the pressurization wasn't hard at all.  It wasn't really difficult to use.Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did.

I attempted to cook food, my first run, and 15 minutes later The entire machine is in smokes. Quickly filled my kitchen and house with a horid smoke of burnt plastic. There were sparks coming off the bottom of the machine while it was turned on . I quickly unplugged the machine and turned it over to inspect the counter . I ask myself what would have happened if it had caught fire, or exploded in my face . The sound it was making seemed like it was going to.  As you see the plastic melted, it was liquid all over my counter, and it was not easy to clean off the counter or my tainted hands. The bottom of the machine and remaining wires where bright, scolding red. I ruined kitchen towels, had to shower again before going to work. I was running late because of the ordeal i had to deal with. Forced to eat out with my wife because, just wasted the food being cooked wich was about to be amazing. . . . The worst thing is i am writing this and the machine goes in smokes for no reason. What do i do? This thing is just going in smokes unplugged. This is terriblleee.\n', ""\n  I use this for everything! How did I live without this before???I live in a Sprinter van full-time and was using an induction burner for cooking, but since I've gotten this little gem, I haven't used the induction burner once!This is so easy to use, and it's the perfect size for one or two people. I've been making a lot of stews, and I'll saute the onions, carrots, and meat (if I'm using meat) then add everything else, seal it, and set it for 7 minutes on high pressure. I let it release naturally and have a perfectly cooked, tasty meal every time. This gives me enough for 4 or 5 servings.I also quick soaked beans the other day by covering them with water, hitting pressure for 5 min. then letting it release naturally and let it sit (not on keep warm) for a couple of hours.I'll often make dinner right after I reheat my lunch, and make sure the keep warm function is on. I'm able to drive with it in my sink and have a hot, healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I'm done driving.I've even baked banana bread in it!!! So exciting, because I don't have an oven. It turned out SO good! I used one of the containers and the lid from my To-Go Ware stainless steel lunch container to bake it in on the rack.Because this cooks so quickly, it is very easy on my solar system. I can reheat leftovers on saute in 4 minutes, and it's only drawing 67a while it's on.I did have a VitaClay, that I absolutely loved for making beans, and especially bone broth, but it takes much longer to cook and is heavier. So, more battery drain, more storage space, and more weight as compared to the Instant Pot Mini and the Mini wins on each count!\n"", '\n  This pot is designed to not work. The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The ""solution"" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot. Ours will be relegated to stock pot duty as we have found it to be totally unusable as a pressure cooker.\n', ""\n  Just worked a year! The light is on but no heat.

It has no doubt cut down my food expenses (cutting down take-out and product waste) but has also renewed my passion for cooking! I was tired of dry over cooked meat and hours of standing in the kitchen trying to simmer cook meals for flavour. I work long hours and can’t devote an entire day to meal prep, so being able to come home and make a one pot meal in 10 minutes with veggies, protein, and my starch all at once has been life changing! You can cook meat from frozen states in minutes with no need to even defrost! I can cook two juicy and tender chicken breasts fully in 5-6 minutes!So Here Are My Favourite Features Of The Instant Pot DUO Series:PROS:FASTThe contents of the pressure cooker cooks at a higher temperature than what can be achieved by a conventional boil — more heat means more speed. Pressure cooking is about twice as fast as conventional cooking (sometimes, faster!) I have included a few of the cook times below for common meats below. Cooking both from fresh or frozen states. Please be advised a full set of cooking times and charts will be available to you in the included ""recipe book"" that comes with your instant pot. Below I provide my personal experiences so yours may differ slightly.BEEF: • Pot Roasts – 30 – 40 minutes • Stew Meat – 15 – 20 minutes • Ribs – 25 – 30 minutes • Ground Beef, frozen – 10-25 minutesCHICKEN • Whole – 6 minutes per pound • Boneless – 5-8 minutes • Boneless, frozen – 8-12 minutes • Bone-In – 10 – 15 minutesPORK • Ham, re-heat boneless fully cooked – 6 – 7 minutes • Ham, shoulder – 8 minutes/1LB • Roast, butt – 15 minutes/1LB • Roast, loin – 20 minutes/1LB • Ribs – 20 – 25 minutes • Chops – 5 – 6 minutesFISH • Whole – 5 – 6 minutes • Whole, frozen – 7 – 10 minutes • Fillets – 2 – 3 minutes • Fillet, frozen – 3 – 4 minutesPlease note that you can also make grains, fruits and vegetables (fresh or frozen), as well as yogurt and many desserts in this post aswell. Cook time will be available in your guide but I will add pictures attached to this review of the cooling charts for your knowledge. This review cannot possibly cover all the amazing things this pot can do for you.EASE OF USEI truly believe anyone can make a fantastic meal regardless of skill set! The instant pot Duo offers preset programs so it\'s as easy as putting your meat/starch/whatever in the pot, adding water, closing the lid and pressing a button to get it started. No calculations required! Please note, just because you do not have a certain pre-set button on your model does not mean you cannot use your pot to make it. For example, the Duo series does not has a ""cake"" button pre-set. All this means is that you will follow a recipe and instead of hitting ""cake"" you will hit ""manual"" and cook it at pressure for however long the recipe says. This pot truly can do everything!HEALTHY""Pressure cooking is one of the healthiest cooking methods. According to a study published in the Journal of Food Science, pressure cooking preserves 90-95% of vitamins. The extra speed and heat of pressure cooking practically flash-cooks vegetables, allowing them to retain more vitamins than boiling, (which only retains 40-75%), or even conventional steaming (75-90%!)"" -Instant PotGREEN""Pressure cookers require less energy/electricity to operate during the cooking process. Less heat and time translates to up to 70% energy savings in comparison to conventional cooking methods."" - Instant PotSAFEThese are not your grandmother\'s pressure cookers! The days of worrying about your cooler exploding are gone! Modern pressure cookers have additional safety systems to ensure that if one should fail, another will kick-in. This pot is so safe that I truly believe there is nothing to be worried about. The only problem I do have with it though, is the steam release valve. If used improperly you could get burned by steam. I will be covering that next in the CONS section. Item list 1 star off review for the hazard of a steam burn.So What Are The Cons:1. The steam release valve- I am not a fan of this design for two reasons:The first being that the valve must be reset from its ""venting"" positions to its ""sealed"" position each time before pressure cooking. When pressure cooking and time is finished the valve will automatically go from sealed to venting. However, it does not reset, so next time you go to pressure cook in this pot you will need to remember to reset the valve to ""sealing"" or you will open your pot and find out your food is underdone. Sadly this model does not alert you if you forget. If this is a big deal breaker for you like it was for me, I recommend you check out my review on the Instant Pot Ultra 60. It has an automatic venting/sealing feature so you no longer have to worry about this.Second, the position of the valve. Please always use a long spoon or included rice paddle to push the steam valve to venting If you want a ""quick release."" Never use your fingers. The steam comes out of the valve at extremely high pressure and it is HOT HOT HOT. This appears to be a major design flaw in my opinion. As long as you stand back a little from the valve and do not use your hands then you should not get burnt. So always use a long spoon. Another tip is that your making good that could splatter out from the pressure and make a mess, throw a dish towel over the valve as it vents to prevent a clean up.2. Cooking with Stainless Steel:This is a learning curve. If you are unfamiliar with how to properly heat the pot before use (especially in saute mode) it is easy to burn food in the beginning. Luckily there are many online resources on how to do this and its pretty simple!3. Accessories CAN be Expensive:Although its easy to get around buying a bunch of extra stuff, you may find yourself going down the rabbit hole of wanting to try it all. If you are new to cooking this might mean needing some new things for the kitchen. Most everything can be made in this pot though with common glass dishes and the included trivet.Other Great Things Not Mentioned:-Colourful Manual that is easy to follow with lots of pictures!-Many online support and chat groups for 24/7 support and advice!-Fits neatly onto any amount of kitchen counter space.And Many more!!! This is just a starter list!!Overall I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to cut down on there time in the kitchen, trying to save money or just make more flavourful and healthy meals! The Instant Pot Duo has all the same functionally of the upgraded models but without the extra price. It is however missing a few of the ""bells and whistles"" that do make your life even easier but are not a necessity to making amazing food 70% faster! If you are looking for the most fancy version of them all I recommend you check out my review of the ""Ultra 60 Instant Pot"" model, which is my everyday user and total favourite.Was this helpful? Happy cooking!\n', '\n  Me  encuentro en Mexico , me encanto el producto, le di bastante uso, segui las instrucciones correctas de funcionamiento hasta que un dia simplemente ya no encendio.inmediatamente me contacte al servicio tecnico  y desgraciadamente no hacen valida la garantia en Mexicomi pregunta es..¿Por que venden un producto que no tiene garantia?mucha falta de profesionalismo\n', '\n  I\'m still undecided on the instant pot. My transaction was perfect, item was shipped on time very happy with that part. As for the product itself, I\'ve used it a few times and I don\'t think there\'s really anything ""instant"" about it. If using the pressure cook feature it takes almost twenty minutes to build up pressure, and then another 15-30 minutes to let pressure out naturally (which some recipes call for). I made a pot roast and veggies and from start to finish it took me almost two hours to cook the meal taking into account the wait times. It makes great food, and I\'ll probably use it in the future, but not quite the ""instant"" appliance I thought it would be. I didn\'t expect it to magically cook everything in a few minutes, it just takes longer than I expected.\n', ""\n  I had the same issue with mine pressure cooker doesn't work. And their Technical Support team (a person named Sharu J) doesn't help at all. Since Oct 18, 2018, I have been trying to take my pot somewhere to be checked, or have a technician to come home and check it for once. But all they do is keep sending you lists of questions (5 on one email, 3 on the other), building an endless thread of emails with no solution at all. I also sent them pictures and a video, hoping it could help and I could effectively have my pot working properly. Seems like they want us to just give up and stop answering their emails. Who has time for this kind of service these days? Actually, I had purchased an Instant Pot to save time on meal preparations, not the opposite. I just wanted that my pot worked as I know it could work, I have friends that love their IP. Not me, I couldn't get it working properly, not for once. I feel frustrated with Instant Pot product and poor worthless customer service.\n""]"

The instant pot Duo offers preset programs so it\'s as easy as putting your meat/starch/whatever in the pot, adding water, closing the lid and pressing a button to get it started. No calculations required! Please note, just because you do not have a certain pre-set button on your model does not mean you cannot use your pot to make it. For example, the Duo series does not has a ""cake"" button pre-set. All this means is that you will follow a recipe and instead of hitting ""cake"" you will hit ""manual"" and cook it at pressure for however long the recipe says. This pot truly can do everything!HEALTHY""Pressure cooking is one of the healthiest cooking methods. According to a study published in the Journal of Food Science, pressure cooking preserves 90-95% of vitamins. The extra speed and heat of pressure cooking practically flash-cooks vegetables, allowing them to retain more vitamins than boiling, (which only retains 40-75%), or even conventional steaming (75-90%!)"" -Instant PotGREEN""Pressure cookers require less energy/electricity to operate during the cooking process. Less heat and time translates to up to 70% energy savings in comparison to conventional cooking methods."" - Instant PotSAFEThese are not your grandmother\'s pressure cookers! The days of worrying about your cooler exploding are gone! Modern pressure cookers have additional safety systems to ensure that if one should fail, another will kick-in. This pot is so safe that I truly believe there is nothing to be worried about. The only problem I do have with it though, is the steam release valve. If used improperly you could get burned by steam. I will be covering that next in the CONS section. Item list 1 star off review for the hazard of a steam burn.So What Are The Cons:1. The steam release valve- I am not a fan of this design for two reasons:The first being that the valve must be reset from its ""venting"" positions to its ""sealed"" position each time before pressure cooking. When pressure cooking and time is finished the valve will automatically go from sealed to venting. However, it does not reset, so next time you go to pressure cook in this pot you will need to remember to reset the valve to ""sealing"" or you will open your pot and find out your food is underdone. Sadly this model does not alert you if you forget. If this is a big deal breaker for you like it was for me, I recommend you check out my review on the Instant Pot Ultra 60. It has an automatic venting/sealing feature so you no longer have to worry about this.Second, the position of the valve. Please always use a long spoon or included rice paddle to push the steam valve to venting If you want a ""quick release."" Never use your fingers. The steam comes out of the valve at extremely high pressure and it is HOT HOT HOT. This appears to be a major design flaw in my opinion. As long as you stand back a little from the valve and do not use your hands then you should not get burnt. So always use a long spoon. Another tip is that your making good that could splatter out from the pressure and make a mess, throw a dish towel over the valve as it vents to prevent a clean up.2. Cooking with Stainless Steel:This is a learning curve. If you are unfamiliar with how to properly heat the pot before use (especially in saute mode) it is easy to burn food in the beginning. Luckily there are many online resources on how to do this and its pretty simple!3. Accessories CAN be Expensive:Although its easy to get around buying a bunch of extra stuff, you may find yourself going down the rabbit hole of wanting to try it all. If you are new to cooking this might mean needing some new things for the kitchen. Most everything can be made in this pot though with common glass dishes and the included trivet.Other Great Things Not Mentioned:-Colourful Manual that is easy to follow with lots of pictures!-Many online support and chat groups for 24/7 support and advice!-Fits neatly onto any amount of kitchen counter space.And Many more!!! This is just a starter list!!Overall I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to cut down on there time in the kitchen, trying to save money or just make more flavourful and healthy meals! The Instant Pot Duo has all the same functionally of the upgraded models but without the extra price. It is however missing a few of the ""bells and whistles"" that do make your life even easier but are not a necessity to making amazing food 70% faster! If you are looking for the most fancy version of them all I recommend you check out my review of the ""Ultra 60 Instant Pot"" model, which is my everyday user and total favourite.Was this helpful? Happy cooking!\n', '\n  Me  encuentro en Mexico , me encanto el producto, le di bastante uso, segui las instrucciones correctas de funcionamiento hasta que un dia simplemente ya no encendio.inmediatamente me contacte al servicio tecnico  y desgraciadamente no hacen valida la garantia en Mexicomi pregunta es..¿Por que venden un producto que no tiene garantia?mucha falta de profesionalismo\n', '\n  I\'m still undecided on the instant pot. My transaction was perfect, item was shipped on time very happy with that part. As for the product itself, I\'ve used it a few times and I don\'t think there\'s really anything ""instant"" about it. If using the pressure cook feature it takes almost twenty minutes to build up pressure, and then another 15-30 minutes to let pressure out naturally (which some recipes call for). I made a pot roast and veggies and from start to finish it took me almost two hours to cook the meal taking into account the wait times. It makes great food, and I\'ll probably use it in the future, but not quite the ""instant"" appliance I thought it would be. I didn\'t expect it to magically cook everything in a few minutes, it just takes longer than I expected.\n', ""\n  I had the same issue with mine pressure cooker doesn't work. And their Technical Support team (a person named Sharu J) doesn't help at all. Since Oct 18, 2018, I have been trying to take my pot somewhere to be checked, or have a technician to come home and check it for once. But all they do is keep sending you lists of questions (5 on one email, 3 on the other), building an endless thread of emails with no solution at all. I also sent them pictures and a video, hoping it could help and I could effectively have my pot working properly. Seems like they want us to just give up and stop answering their emails. Who has time for this kind of service these days? Actually, I had purchased an Instant Pot to save time on meal preparations, not the opposite. I just wanted that my pot worked as I know it could work, I have friends that love their IP. Not me, I couldn't get it working properly, not for once. I feel frustrated with Instant Pot product and poor worthless customer service.\n""]"

It was instant love with the device. As a matter of fact, one week later we ordered a larger unit.Just recently we found that the front dialing button was stuck. I carefully removed it and found that it was bent out of shape in the portion that seats inside of the panel. It is easy to figure out that this could have happened because of the heat that the unit generates (button is made of plastic).I contacted Instant Pot customer service asking if this was covered by warranty, or if not, how could I purchase a replacement. This is their reply:""Hello Edmundo,Thank you for getting that information to us, it is appreciated.This piece is not sold separately as the base comes as one full unit. This is not something that is covered under warranty. With that said we can offer you our loyalty price on a new Ultra mini cooker base for $65.95 USD.Please let us know if you would like to move forward.""I am very disappointed with this reply. I am not willing to buy a whole unit just to replace a small cheap button. I am sure that they have thousands of these buttons at their warehouse. The button is replaceable, you can pull it out and push it back in. It is not a fixed part of the base unit. I am disappointed because this company can not offer me a simple solution for a small problem.The Ultra Mini is an excellent product. I have solved the button problem by putting it back in and not pushing it all the way in. Works perfectly until I can find a similar button somewhere. It is not  a big issue. What is a big issue is the poor customer service attitude of this company.Best regards,Edmundo\n', ""\n  This is actually my second Instant Pot Ultra. I also have a 6-quart model that I use nearly every day (and my 25yo son bought a 6-quart, so we actually have 3 IPs in the house).I purchased this 3-quart Instant Pot for making rice and side dishes. It is not unusual for me to have both going at the same time.I chose the Ultra because of the ability to adjust actual temperature. There are a couple of differences between the 6-quart and 3-quart models.1.  The display does not have the up and down of the 6 and 8-quart models. It is a straight line along the bottom of the display area with small bars indicating progress.2. The sealing ring is much more difficult to remove and put back as it is quite tight. So if you have weakness in your hands, this might not be a good model for you. My 6-quart sealing rings are almost loose when they are in place, and come out and reinstall easily.3.  Capacity is very small vs. the 6 and 8 quart. Remember, you aren't supposed to fill it more than 2/3 full (liquid). That means it is really 2 quart for liquid foods.4. The first few times I used it, it was difficult to get the release pressure button to engage fully and I almost thought it was a faulty unit. However, over time, it is easier to push down to fully engage so pressure releases without me holding down the button.I did buy a steamer basket for this size since I use it for steaming veggies and other side dishes. Again, I mostly use it was a rice maker. It makes perfect rice: brown, white, basmatti, jasmine. Oh, I recommend turning off Keep Warm as if you are forgetful like me, your rice could end up a mush.If you are buying only one Instant Pot, this might be too small to make one-pot meals. I recommend a 6-quart for that purpose. For side dishes, it is perfect. Oh, I can make 3 cups of rice at a time with no problem (all kinds).\n"", ""\n  Having used a pressure cooker and canner for years as a young bride and mother, I love my new 3 qt. ultra Instant Pot. That is why I rated it a 10. The instructions/manual are poor, poor, poor and I rated them a 1. Heaven help the person who doesn't have the internet or has a hard time using the internet, they will be like me. I took an hour and a half trying to start the cooking of a pot of chili. Chili was great...so was the 3 glasses of wine I drank to calm my frustration level.\n"", '\n  This worked fine for a couple of months.  Now all it does is show BURN and shut off.  I can no longer cook rice in it without this happening!!  I even Tried coating the bottom with olive oil. It is now completely useless as a pressure cooker.  I want my money back!\n', ""\n  I love the instant pot pressure cooker! However I would like to make 2 points that may help others.- First, I was hoping a 3 qt mini would be enough for me (single guy). I can tell you, while it being OK, I outgrew it on the first day. I believe 6 qt is the way to go, even for a single person. It isn't just about the amount of food you make. You can do so much more with it. No comparison!- Second, the ultra does not really have any functional differences from the DUO model, apart from different interface. 10 in 1 - is just marketing. I bought a 6 qt DUO, and let me tell you - it is way more convenient to use, since you have buttons instead of a pesky dial, and the venting mechanism is much more robust. The Ultra looks better though. But it comes at the cost of user friendliness and higher price.I am returning my 3qt Ultra and keeping the 6qt DUO. I love it so much more!!\n"", '\n  Esta olla de presión automática es lo mejor! meto los ingredientes, selecciono el modo y listo, se apaga solo, y no se quema nada.

Algo que también  me encanta es ya no uso gas ya que esta funciona con electricidad lo cual resulta en un muy ahorro de en la cocina.

I read and read all the reviews for the various ""x in 1"" machines trying to decide which version would be the best.  I opted for the most expensive (10 in 1) Instant Pot.  Now that I have it, and have been using it, I find I never use the ""10"" presets - most recipes tell you to use ""manual mode"", so turns out I likely would have been just as happy with a 7 in 1.

I got my first pressure cooker in 1974. That\'s a long enough time to allow the development of strong opinions. I had an Instant Pot and loved it. My opinion of ihe Instant Pot Duo Crisp is that it\'s a piece of junk which has no place in a serious kitchen.The control panel is unreadable unless you bend down and look straight at it; this is an annoyance but easily fixable with a Sharpie. The pressure cooker works fine. It was better once I learned that the quick release lock cannot be engaged while the lid is on the cooker. The saute function works fine, as long as you stir the food to keep it from sticking on the hot spots. The air fryer basket is very poorly designed: if you use both levels, you cannot turn food over on the bottom tier without removing the top rack, and the top rack is designed to spill its contents all over the counter when it is removed.  It would have been really helpful if there was any information in the manuals about how much oil to use. Just saying ""uses less oil"" is meaningless.  It took over 30 minutes to \'air-fry\' 12 chicken wings starting with fully-thawed, refrigerated meat.The sous vide never got above 140F, when it was set to 200F. Same with the slow cooker; it gets just warm enough to breed salmonella cultures.I have not and will not try out the roast, bake, or broil functions because I expect that would only result in me having to salvage or discard ingredients. The user manual guidelines are completely useless for these functions.The user manual was obviously written for someone who cannot remember for five minutes that CAUTION: Pressure Cookers Get Hot! and has to be told every time that the appliance won\'t work if it\'s not plugged in.These are the most significant complaints I have about this artifact. I will be discarding it as soon as I can afford a different pressure cooker.Learn from my mistakes, fellow cooks.\n', '\n  I purchased this item after hearing everyone in my office talk about how much they love their instant pot or air fryer. So, I figured this would be the best of both worlds. After receiving the unit I realized that the majority of my needs would be for the air fryer. So I started making chicken fingers and french fries. After a few uses I noticed that the air fryer basket (which is coated in non-stick material, a toxic chemical) had a bunch of places where the non stick coating was missing. Upon further inspection I noticed it is chipping off and was most likely consumed by me while eating my chicken fingers.  This is terrifying and I immediately reached out to the manufacturer, who told me they will ship me a replacement when they have one. I have waited over a month and this monstrosity of a kitchen appliance just sits on my counter taking up a ton of space. I wrote into Instant pot again and they offered me a modest discount a second instant pot product. Stay away from this product for air frying, it may have harmful effects on your health. Also, it has a large footprint and it comes with two big tops, so make sure you have the room for storing it.\n', '\n  Update:After 1.5 months of daily use, I have to say this is the best cooking device I’ve ever used. Everything works just as advertised. If you have to buy only one thing for your kitchen, this is it. I increased the rating to 4, 1 off because of the horrible airfryer basket issue described below. If you need a replacement for the basket, look up on amazon the “air fryer replacement basket 3.7qt for power gowise usa air fryer”. I read a review saying that it fits the instant pot duo crisp so I bought it and yeah it does. I’ve used that one constantly for a month without a single scratch. This is my real experience, not paid review.I like instant pot a lot but I gotta say the airfryer basket is such a disappointment. I only used wooden tools and soft sponge with it but after only 2 wash the basket already got scratched. There’s another bigger scratch than the one shown here but I’m too lazy to take a new photo. I asked the customer service but they pointed me to Amazon seller (after sending them all photos and details) which provides information to basically tell me to contact Instant Pot again. Great machine, bad basket, not impressed with customer service so far.\n', '\n  I was so excited to buy this product.  It had been on my ""saved for later"" list for a long time.  I was especially excited because it was an 11 in one product.  It was a bit bigger than I wanted, but it was the only one that was an 11 in one product.  Before I arrived I had printed out at least 50 recipes to try.  My first disappointment was that some of the accessories that came with it, clearly were meant for a smaller model, and when I brought it to the attention of the seller they asked for a whole lot of things that a non tech savy senior citizen was in no position to do.Then, I was disappointed when the cooking surface was so small.  It was an 8 quart instant pot but the cooking surface was clearly no bigger than a 4 quart.  They clearly went UP rather than out as they increased capacity.My final disappointment was when it would not property pressurize and when half of the control panel functions wouldn\'t work.  I returned it.  I cook a lot and I am going back to the tried and true methods.\n']"

It wasn't really difficult to use.Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did.

A day later no response! So I email again asking for help. This time I email them the same information. Didn't hear from them until Friday! I needed my pot fixed on Tuesday.... On Thursday though I had had enough and called Amazon who thankfully knows how to treat customers and were able to refund me the product and I shipped it back to them.

The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The ""solution"" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot.

The days of worrying about your cooler exploding are gone! Modern pressure cookers have additional safety systems to ensure that if one should fail, another will kick-in. This pot is so safe that I truly believe there is nothing to be worried about. The only problem I do have with it though, is the steam release valve. If used improperly you could get burned by steam. I will be covering that next in the CONS section. Item list 1 star off review for the hazard of a steam burn.So What Are The Cons:1. The steam release valve- I am not a fan of this design for two reasons:The first being that the valve must be reset from its ""venting"" positions to its ""sealed"" position each time before pressure cooking. When pressure cooking and time is finished the valve will automatically go from sealed to venting. However, it does not reset, so next time you go to pressure cook in this pot you will need to remember to reset the valve to ""sealing"" or you will open your pot and find out your food is underdone. Sadly this model does not alert you if you forget. If this is a big deal breaker for you like it was for me, I recommend you check out my review on the Instant Pot Ultra 60. It has an automatic venting/sealing feature so you no longer have to worry about this.Second, the position of the valve. Please always use a long spoon or included rice paddle to push the steam valve to venting If you want a ""quick release."" Never use your fingers. The steam comes out of the valve at extremely high pressure and it is HOT HOT HOT. This appears to be a major design flaw in my opinion. As long as you stand back a little from the valve and do not use your hands then you should not get burnt. So always use a long spoon. Another tip is that your making good that could splatter out from the pressure and make a mess, throw a dish towel over the valve as it vents to prevent a clean up.2. Cooking with Stainless Steel:This is a learning curve. If you are unfamiliar with how to properly heat the pot before use (especially in saute mode) it is easy to burn food in the beginning. Luckily there are many online resources on how to do this and its pretty simple!3. Accessories CAN be Expensive:Although its easy to get around buying a bunch of extra stuff, you may find yourself going down the rabbit hole of wanting to try it all. If you are new to cooking this might mean needing some new things for the kitchen. Most everything can be made in this pot though with common glass dishes and the included trivet.Other Great Things Not Mentioned:-Colourful Manual that is easy to follow with lots of pictures!-Many online support and chat groups for 24/7 support and advice!-Fits neatly onto any amount of kitchen counter space.And Many more!!! This is just a starter list!!Overall I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to cut down on there time in the kitchen, trying to save money or just make more flavourful and healthy meals! The Instant Pot Duo has all the same functionally of the upgraded models but without the extra price. It is however missing a few of the ""bells and whistles"" that do make your life even easier but are not a necessity to making amazing food 70% faster! If you are looking for the most fancy version of them all I recommend you check out my review of the ""Ultra 60 Instant Pot"" model, which is my everyday user and total favourite.Was this helpful? Happy cooking!\n', '\n  Me  encuentro en Mexico , me encanto el producto, le di bastante uso, segui las instrucciones correctas de funcionamiento hasta que un dia simplemente ya no encendio.inmediatamente me contacte al servicio tecnico  y desgraciadamente no hacen valida la garantia en Mexicomi pregunta es..¿Por que venden un producto que no tiene garantia?mucha falta de profesionalismo\n', '\n  I\'m still undecided on the instant pot. My transaction was perfect, item was shipped on time very happy with that part. As for the product itself, I\'ve used it a few times and I don\'t think there\'s really anything ""instant"" about it. If using the pressure cook feature it takes almost twenty minutes to build up pressure, and then another 15-30 minutes to let pressure out naturally (which some recipes call for). I made a pot roast and veggies and from start to finish it took me almost two hours to cook the meal taking into account the wait times. It makes great food, and I\'ll probably use it in the future, but not quite the ""instant"" appliance I thought it would be. I didn\'t expect it to magically cook everything in a few minutes, it just takes longer than I expected.\n', ""\n  I had the same issue with mine pressure cooker doesn't work. And their Technical Support team (a person named Sharu J) doesn't help at all. Since Oct 18, 2018, I have been trying to take my pot somewhere to be checked, or have a technician to come home and check it for once. But all they do is keep sending you lists of questions (5 on one email, 3 on the other), building an endless thread of emails with no solution at all. I also sent them pictures and a video, hoping it could help and I could effectively have my pot working properly. Seems like they want us to just give up and stop answering their emails. Who has time for this kind of service these days? Actually, I had purchased an Instant Pot to save time on meal preparations, not the opposite. I just wanted that my pot worked as I know it could work, I have friends that love their IP. Not me, I couldn't get it working properly, not for once. I feel frustrated with Instant Pot product and poor worthless customer service.\n""]"

If you prefer to have a summery see section marked THE BOTTOM LINE=========================================When I first got the Ninja Foodi in as an order, I was all excited.  I was dancing around the house and ran smack into a wall of ,"" Well, what is so great about this stupid Ninja Foodie?""  I stopped dead in my tracks.  I didn\'t really even know.  I mean, when I got to thinking about it, I was not even sure why I wanted one.When it arrived in the delivery, I took it out and almost fainted at the size.  It sat like a behemoth on my stove top (on a board) and I said to myself in regret, ""What have I DONE?""  I stared at this machine for a few days horrified.  I looked at the book and was overwhelmed.  My God HOW was I going to rationalize the presence of this monster to my very skeptical family.If you are in that position right now, or perhaps afraid to get one, let me help you out..WHAT IS THIS LIKE?This is one BIG machine.  It is like the large round crock pots before they started making them oval and larger foot print.  It has a rack with an additional rack that attaches to it.  There is an inner bowl that has a ceramic coating and then an air fryer basket.  It also comes with a pressure lid.  I will break this down in sections for you.COOKBOOKThere are two books. One is a small instruction manual which has basic information to help you decide what to make and how.  There is also a basic cookbook which helps you start with some basic recipes.SIZE OF MACHINEThe first consideration is size.  When deciding where to put this there are things to keep in mind.  You will need 16 inches minimum circumference to put this on for the machine.  you will need 19 INCHES OF WIDTH for when you have the top hinged cover open.You will need 24 INCHES OF CLEARANCE FOR LID BEING OPEN.  With the machine closed it is 14 INCHES HIGH CLOSED.PRESSURE COOKINGWhen doing recipes, many of them will require you to put the pressure lid on which is not connected to the unit.  You will pressure cook, release the valve, do something inside, and sometimes pressure cook again, or change to a broil setting which requires that you remove the pressure lid and place the hinged lid with the fan and heater on top to finish.AIR FRYINGThere is an air fryer basket that comes with this.  It sits inside the ceramic pan so the air can circulate around.BROILThis is using the hinged lid and is often used to finish a recipe that requires crispy toppingSEARThis is a simple task for meats etc but I prefer to use my stove for that as it is quicker for me and the machine takes longer to heat up.STEAM, SLOW COOK, DEHYDRATE, YOGURT, BAKEAll of these settings require either of the lids and are pretty easy to do with the book.HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?Once I got the overwhelming appearance out of the way I decided to try something simple- frozen sweet potato fries.  When I got them done, I was shocked.  I have used a LOT of air fryers now and this was the best result I have gotten in any of them.  There was a perfect balance of moisture and crispy when following instructions.WHAT HAVE I MADE SO FAR?After that, I got adventurous and decided to make other things.  Here is a partial list of what we have done so far and a quick evaluationSWEET POTATO FRIES- fantastic balance of moisture and crispPEACH COBBLER- peaches full of flavor and the crumble crust was fantasticCHICKEN, RICE, VEGETABLE TRIO- it was challenging to do at first, but the result was worth it.CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS- Absolutely the BEST I have EVER had and we have used a lot of different methodsCAKE- done perfectlyWHAT IS NEXT?We plan to do yogurt soon although someone lost the book so I have to go search it out in the house somewhere (not bad for skeptics, eh? Now they all want to use it- HA)GLUTEN FREEI might want to add here that we have used this for quite a few gluten free recipes and paleo and it works beautifully.STILL NERVOUS?Don\'t do what I did and buy a few cookbooks.  They all look like they were written by either A.I. or someone who barely speaks English with just typed out recipes.  You would be better off looking around the internet for videos or other recipes.AM I GLAD WE GOT THIS?It is really big, I won\'t play that down.  You have to have a lot of counter space and you also need to consider that you will have to be releasing steam from the pressure cooker.  That means you can not have anything above the place you use it which will be damaged long term from steam being all over it.We are going to be removing a food dehydrator after harvest season to put the Ninja Foodi in its place for the winter.  It is really handy to have something which makes so many things so easily and with so much flavor.  It is annoying to have to bring it out all of the time and put it away when done.  It is very heavy and not easy to carry around.So far I have to say that this is one of the coolest things we have gotten.  So far, have one of the Ninja Coffee machines (which we LOVE and use CONSTANTLY) , a Shark Vacuum which is my favorite, and the original ninja chopper which we also use constantly.  This is right up there with those in performance so far.It takes up a lot of room, but it is worth it if you are cooking for two or three people max.WARNINGI will warn you, make sure you ONLY USE WOOD OR SILICONE UTENSILS ON ANY OF YOUR PANS IN THE FOODI.  This coating can chip pretty easily so you want to be sure to make it last as long as possible.  Be GENTLE with it when putting the different racks and air fryer container in it.CLEANINGThe last topic I will address is cleaning.  As you may guess cleaning this is not a snap, but it is not overly difficult.  You have to take the time to do it AFTER EVER USE, however.  The pans can be washed.  The air fryer container comes apart for easy cleaning.  The top grate over the fan/element has to be wiped down carefully once cool, making sure not to leave residue of soap lest it burn later.The pressure cover has to be cleaned as well, wiping it down and removing and cleaning gaskets too.THE BOTTOM LINEAlthough this is large and is a bit overwhelming at first to learn, it is worth every moment.  This is a fabulous unit and if you treat it carefully, you can get some amazing performance from it.  Be sure to use care with utensils, read instructions, and clean it every use and you will be happy you did.  If you have the room to put it, this is a great unit.MY RATINGFIVE HUGE STARS.  I love this stupid thing and am so glad I did not let the intimidation keep me from moving ahead.  The food in this is so flavorful and quick to make too.  All of the raving out there is true.  This is a great appliance in the kitchen, especially in hot weather when heating the oven is too much.  Also, having it in addition to the stove/oven for Thanksgiving and Christmas and other holidays is a plus and helps prepare such a huge dinner more easily.\n', '\n  There are 2 downsides that I\'ve identified so I will list those first-1. The machine can be side heavy.  The air fryer lid stays on no matter what - and it causes the machine to be a bit side heavy when it is open and not in use.  It won\'t be a problem if you keep it turned around backwards, but I had an issue when I was cleaning it.  I turned it towards me and it fell off the counter and I got a nice big bruise on my calf.  I thought it would be very dangerous if full of a hot liquid, but I don\'t think I\'d ever put it in that position with it full.  Still, I thought it worth mentioning.  In use, I\'ve always wanted it going the other way but to be doubly safe, I don\'t get it anywhere near the edge of a counter!2.-The inner bowl is nonstick.  I\'d really rather it be stainless, but it does work very well and the nonstick is OK, it\'s what I call \'the good kind\' - safe and long lasting.This really does do everything.  I pressure cooked some pork loins in it, drained them after cooking, added some sauce and used the air fryer top.  Oh, it put a perfect sticky sweet sauce on those loins.  The whole thing cleaned up in less than 3 minutes too when it was time to wash up.  I\'ve used it to steam buns with too - it comes with a steamer pan that you can put the buns in, and just a bit of water in the bottom of the pan.  It sears, it steams, it slow cooks - it really does almost everything I need done.The controls are easier for me to use than the Instant Pot.  I have both and will probably get rid of my smaller Instant Pot.  It doesn\'t take the place of the extra large one though because of sheer volume and canning.It comes with a \'cheat sheet\' that had me cooking once I got it washed up.  It also has a very nicely done cook book with it.I gave my ""BIG BOSS"" to my dad and my ""Crock Pot Multicooker"" to my sister.  I will also be getting rid of my \'regular\' sized Instant Pot, so I can definitely say that for me this takes the place of at least 3 small appliances.  Now, if you have a BIG BOSS or large airfryer, know this is only going to do a smaller amount, but I never used mine for large amounts anyway.  I keep most of my small appliances on a set of shelves and get them down as needed, but for this one, I cleaned off a permanent place on the counter.\n', '\n  Love this product EXTREMELY DISAPOINTED IN THE PRICE.  have always thought Amazon price the best but absolutely not! Found the same unit at in larger size WITH extra accessories for 60.00 less at my local costco. Gotta check all prices now, kinda defeats the whole convenience thing because now I have to spend day shopping because I cant trust pricing\n', ""\n  Purchased less than a month ago & as each week goes by, we are starting to use more & more!Our actifry was 5+ years old & we used it at least 2x per week but were sick of the cleaning its PITA stirring paddle, the chipping teflon coating, & how poorly it fit in the dishwasher.Finally purchased the Foodi & are sure glad we did!  So far, we have done rice (excellent), wings (way better than actifry, & as near to deep-fried as one can get without a deep fryer), two beef roasts (excellent & moist) one with potatoes/carrots (turned out gret), one without, & beef jerky (first time ever & it was freaking phen-om-en-al!!Pros: - Pressure cooking reduces time cooking certain foods & leaves them moist - Tendercrisp function crisps up wings way better (than actifry) - Dehydrating function -- soo easy to make beef jerky! - All pots fit in dishwasher nicely AND clean by hand easily - At least 60% quieter than the actifry - Multi-pot / trays are great for variety of mealsCons: - Takes up counterspace (but same as actifry just taller) - Have to store pressure cooking lid separately - Have to teach the wife how to use it now (she's upset I can cook circles around her now)In summary, if you are on the fence about investing in, don't hesitate when it goes on sale because it is so very versatile!\n"", '\n  I just received my ninja foodi and could not wait to try it.  I made my air fryer chicken recipe and did not even need to flip the chicken and it came out perfect. Nice crispy skin. Moist meat and cooked thoroughly with no dry parts. My husband said it was the best fried chicken he ever ate. He has been complaining about a sore knee all day but this great chicken made him forget all about the pain.  Now we can’t wait to try other things. It is also a pressure cooker and a slow cooker and roaster so we will be cooking up a storm  Hope this unit keeps working well for years to come. You will not be disappointed if you decide to spend the extra money and get this multi purpose cooker\n', ""\n  I had been looking at Insta Pots for almost a year, and kept going back and forth between, do I really need it, or do I just want it?Then I came across the Ninja Foodi. I am a lover of all things Ninja/Shark so I said s**** it, and bought it (even though it's way more than an Insta Pot!)I haven't used my oven or stove top since buying this (a little over 2 months) and I literally use it all the time.I'm so glad I went with this and not an Insta Pot, as this literally does everything!I'm also glad I went with the 8qt over the 6 qt. We are a family of 4, and this fits everything perfectly. I think a 6qt would have been too small for us!\n"", '\n  Que la descripción de lo que dice que compré no coincide con lo que recibí.\n']"
