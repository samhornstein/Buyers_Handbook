Charmin is a step up from that and the rolls usually last me 1.25 days, but is more expensive. Cottonelle has the best material of the three and is absorbent, but is also the most expensive and lasts me 1.5 days. All in all, I spend a lot of money on toilet paper every month.

It\'s beyond huge. . .it\'s out of proportion.  The width hasn\'t changed (or maybe it\'s gotten narrower?), but the radius is SO HUGE that not only does it not fit on the toiler paper dispenser at doesn\'t fit in the toilet paper wire rack that is attached to the side of the toilet. So unless I want a stack of toilet paper on the bathroom floor, I can only keep one roll around at a time.The ""supreme"" size is NOT a benefit, it\'s a pain -- because I have to keep it on the floor until I\'ve used half of it so it can finally fit into a normal toilet paper roll dispenser on the wall.  Not only would I NOT recommend this ""supreme"" version, I would have returned it if I hadn\'t already thrown out the gigantic box it came in before I found out about the dimensions of each roll.So, unless you prefer to keep your toilet paper on the floor, I\'d skip this ""supreme"" roll and find a normal size roll of toilet paper to purchase.And a note to the Quilted Northern company -- what were you thinking? Did anyone at your company actually try to put this roll into a bathroom in a regular household? It\'s time to fire the person who thought up this stupid idea for oversize toilet paper rolls.\n', ""\n  We have used the quilted northern for years and have a subscribe and save order for it that we are changing to another product.The rolls are too large, so we ordered the free extenders,but they do not make these as convenient to use as a normal size roll. The extenders cause the roll to be pushed outside the recessed niche and as a result they do not roll as they should. It requires 2 hands to unroll tissues. What we have done is to use the extender adapter until the roll is reduced in size and then to remount the smaller roll onto the normal roller. We are very dissatisfied with this new product presentation and will no longer buy it. We are happy to be on our LAST package.

It used to be nice, soft & plush with very little to no lint.  Now, after cheapening the product several times to make more money, it is garbage.  There is lint all over the floor and the tissue is so thin.  As an example, little lint balls form INSIDE the packaging just from the rolls touching each other.  So now I take a roll out of the package, hold it over the trash, rub off the lint balls and then put it in the holder.  I'm done.  I'm shopping for a new brand once this package is gone.\n"", '\n  I ordered this item around March 3rd, when toilet paper could still be found on grocery store shelves. Everyone was talking about the possibility of isolating ourselves and the Coronavirus. Last week I opened my first pack of this Northern TP I had ordered and received. I use Northern normally, so I know what it is really like...and what I received is NOT the real product. At least not the good product you buy in stores. The rolls are NOT quilted. The 2 plies are not even formed into a single sheet of TP. It isn’t pressed or glued together or whatever manufacturers do to make 2 ply into a single sheet. Northern is soft, what I got is anything but soft. Is there such a thing as “seconds” when it comes to TP? If so, that’s what I received instead of  the real Northern toilet paper! I guess I shouldn’t complain because right now TP can’t be found but...different story on March 3. Regardless, this practice is deceitful.\n', ""\n  The rolls are really, really large and definitely have the amount of paper that they claim on the wrapper. I had, up to this point, never seen a roll as large! One word of caution; be sure that a huge roll will fit on your bathroom toilet paper roll dispenser. I've attached two pictures to try to show how large these rolls really are before you purchase them. I hope that this review helps you in making your purchasing decision.\n"", '\n  Why didn\'t I listen to the other reviews?  I thought everyone was exaggerating about the over-the-top size, but how wrong I was.....These rolls are not realistic for most people\'s bathrooms.If you\'re like me and have built-in toilet paper holders recessed into tile, these rolls will not fit.  And I don\'t mean ""...they won\'t fit, but you could cram them in there if you really try.""  I mean  ""....they won\'t fit and the futile act of trying to jam them into the holder is going to make you turn green and bulk out like the Incredible Hulk.""SO what do you do when you\'re stuck with 24 Big McLarge Huge rolls of toilet paper that won\'t fit in your holder?  You\'re forced to sit there and improvise a solution, ultimately offloading roughly 1/4 of the roll onto a spare empty cardboard roll.  Perhaps you need a moment to collect yourself and stop laughing at me......but it\'s true.  I sat there, winding excess toilet paper onto an empty tube like an old-timey wool spinner making yarn from sheepswool in Colonial Williamsburg.  As if life wasn\'t busy enough without taking up my exciting new hobby of toilet paper re-rolling.Who the hell uses these huge diameter rolls?  They\'re not practical for normal toilet paper holders.  I\'ve attached some photos showing how much you need to offload onto a spare tube in order to get the roll to fit in the holder.  Never again!\n', '\n  Compared to single rolls, these rolls last much longer so you’re not always needing to replace the empty roll so frequently.  These Supreme rolls are even bigger than double rolls.  Also, they are known not to clog up your toilet, unlike some other brands.  A friend of mine said a plumber who had to come to unclog her toilet and waste line suggested that she switch to Quilted Norther over the brand she had been using, that caused this clog.  Even if you have small children, who tend to over use toilet paper for their purposes, this, for the most part, will flush away easily and not clog your pipes.  I have a hard time finding the Supreme rolls in stores in my area so, I always order it from Amazon.  Convenient for me to order and, not over priced.  I’d call it a “Best Buy”.  And, the layers make it strong for its purpose and yes, it is soft.  It’s the only brand I buy.\n', ""\n  I received my last subscription delivery in December. Not pleased. The quality went down and the price went up. I've never seen so much lint. I decided to switch to Charmin before the next delivery... then the pandemic and shortage started. I just went to buy tp in a grocery store for the first time years - they have it now, if you go in early enough - but I did not go in quite early enough, and ended up with 4 pack of this same stuff, the Quilted Northern Soft and Strong. And... it's completely different. The stuff from the grocery store isn't linty at all. What's the deal?Pic is a side by side, grocery store vs Amazon version of the same tp. I actually grabbed a roll that was LESS linty that average. But... the difference is still visible. And that lint is throughout the rolls, on every sheet. Gross.Edit: The subscription filled after all. Now I'm stuck with 24 rolls of this stuff. I thought maybe Amazon would have gotten the message and fixed the problem with their supplier after all the negative reviews, but if anything - the latest batch is worse. Avoid this.\n"", ""\n  I tried Quilted Northern due to the ever decreasing quality of Charmin.  Well, I cannot recommend Quilted Northern.  The biggest issue is the small pieces of residue left when using it.  I never had that problem with Charmin and while the strength is comparable, the residue is a big problem.  It's hard to explain but these little white dustlike pieces come on your hands when you use the paper.  It is very soft but I'd sacrifice the softeness to avoid the pieces.  I will return to Charmin and finish the remaining amount I have of the Northern.  It's disappointing because others have recommended this brand when I was looking for a new brand and now I find myself returning back to start since I do not like Angel Soft or generic brands.\n"", '\n  Cumple con lo que necesitaba, es resistente, suave y los rollos son gruesos, me gusto mucho, totalmente lo volvería a comprar\n']"

It. All.  We have girls in my house and to be blunt, we are tired of TP that lints, and sticks to our parts!  Even the top rated tp\'s out there do it.  So annoying!  They all did it.

When I pulled a roll out of the package, I was faced with a product that didn\'t feel like a soft and absorbent Charmin product. The roll looked funny as well.  When I held it next to a non-mega roll, I understood immediately  what the company had done.  The mega roll was 1/2"" narrower that then normal roll.  So, rather than getting more t.p. the roll most likely had the same amount of paper as the old roll, just configured differently. Also the quality was not up to Charmin standards.

Obviously nobody wants ""gas station"" type toilet paper so I was a bit hesitant to purchase it. I have 2 adults and 3 kids in my household so that\'s an earful of something as important as tp is not liked.Amazon has never disappointed so I figured give it a try and worst case save them for ""emergencies"" in the future (but sense we use Amazon subscribe and save its rare we run out of anything).Well I told my wife I bought it and she was less than pleased to say the least and said to cancel the order. We\'ll I decided not to cancel and I\'m glad that was the decision. Upon receiving it, the packaging is very professional and without the bargain type look to it. The tissue itself in my opinion is in discernible from any other major QUALITY brand and may even be better. I added the first tool and didn\'t tell and of the family and guess what? Nobody said a thing. I even tried to get negative comments by saying ""I blew my nose and whatever tp that is, is horrible"" my wife commented back ""Its the normal charmin ultra stuff"". So in short is very easily past the test. The mega rolls are very large. Our in wall dispenser holds them just fine but if you have a small dispenser you may need to by the non mega roll. The girls in the house loved the flower design. My one Daugherty said ""it\'s pretty"". The paper has no negative comments I can think of and as long as it remains in Stock and at a good price I see no reason we will be changing back and I really encourage you to buy it and try it.I look forward to trying more amazon branded products because this tissue is great quality for sure.\n', ""\n  I pee about a million times a day and need sensitive toilet paper that lasts a long time and is cost effective. I was intrigued to find out Amazon now had its own variety of toilet paper and I can say after giving it a try for 2 months, I am extremely impressed. I typically purchase Angel Soft, Charmin Ultra Soft, or Cottonelle brand tp. Angel Soft is cheap and 1 roll usually lasts me a day. Charmin is a step up from that and the rolls usually last me 1.25 days, but is more expensive. Cottonelle has the best material of the three and is absorbent, but is also the most expensive and lasts me 1.5 days. All in all, I spend a lot of money on toilet paper every month. Therefore, I needed something better and more cost effective.Amazon Presto has it all. It is extremely cost effective. One of these rolls lasts me at least 2 days and the material is super soft and absorbent. I am really happy and won't go back to those other brands. Now if Amazon could only make flushable wipes the world would be a better place...UPDATED 5/18: Needed more toilet paper and could only think of one brand to buy. My husband even stated that he loves Presto too and was impressed by how long-lasting and soft it was.\n"", '\n  This toilet paper is not a good value. You can buy Scott toilet paper from Jet or Walmart for twenty dollars for thirty rolls which comes out to 66 cents per roll, whereas this toilet paper costs twenty dollars for twenty four rolls which comes out to 85 cents per roll. Scott toilet paper weighs 6.4 ounces and Presto toilet paper weighs 4.8 ounces. At 66 cents for 6.4 ounces, Scott toilet paper costs about 10 cents per ounce, whereas Presto toilet paper costs about 18 cents per ounce at 85 cents for 4.8 ounces. You get a lot more for your money with Scott toilet paper. I recommend that you buy Scott toilet paper from Jet or Walmart to save money and get the most for your money.\n', ""\n  I bought this because of the positive reviews and was looking for a no/low-lint decently strong but soft toilet paper. I usually really like Amazon products, and I don't usually write reviews (positive or negative), but this is the absolute worst toilet paper I have ever used. It disintegrates as you use it. I was going to try to use up what I have and then buy something else, but it's so bad that I'm going to just get rid of the remaining rolls and get something different. Really, really disappointed in this product and can't understand the positive reviews. Totally wasted my money on this one.\n"", '\n  I’m a self proclaimed tp snob. I’ve only found one brand ever that I liked (Charmin) until now. I’m impressed by this Presto tp. In fact I just ordered my second case. I saw a lot of people complaining about the fibers left behind. This is disgusting to talk about btw. But my other fav tp does the same thing. I’ve tried the stronger Charmin Ultra Strong and it was too harsh in my opinion. Maybe there’s no fiber, but it wasn’t a pleasant experience.I haven’t actually price compared myself, but it “seems” like a better deal. Plus it’s hard to beat pushing a button when I’m running out of toilet paper and voila!  I guess that’s why Amazon is taking over the world. But I still prefer a Target outing - now I can just leave tp out of the basket.\n', ""\n  This toilet tissue was advertised as being comparable to Charmin Extras Soft. It is NOTHING like Charmin.

Then I thought I would read the reviews to flush out the truth.  After reading all the good reviews, I thought; well maybe it\'s actually good.  So, I took the plunge and ordered some.  Yes, I was very pleasantly surprised upon receiving my  order.  Like others have pointed out, the rolls are big and the sheets are thicker than most others.  And yes, they do the job very nicely, and one can use less paper, thus, saving even more bucks.So, okay Mr. Whipple, it looks like I will stop squeezing Charmin now, because I have fallen in love with a new main squeeze.\n', '\n  The toilet paper itself is outstanding. It has a tough stretchy feel so you are secured when going for the wipe.... Ie: it won\'t tear .There isn\'t a whole lot of dust and flaking off either.

However , make sure you\'re not using wall mounted toilet paper holder because it will NOT fit. I use free standing holders everywhere in my house so these are perfectWhat I don\'t like is the price. It isn\'t cheap.  Yes you get more sheets per roll but you tend to use more when you think you have enough ....\n', '\n  I bought these because tp was sold out everywhere and I was running low.

Large rolls that are packed full of comfort!\n', ""\n  Soft, strong; & really, almost no lint which has been a long time annoyance with other brands.  Does fit my average sized wall holder.  This is a 1st class quality product that's superior to all those famous, extensively advertised brands I've been using.  Wow, here I am gushing over toilet paper!  The price differential others have noted is a minor factor (this is a Gucci quality product) and its increased quantity cancels the seemingly small difference.  For me, I'll never be tempted by famous brand sales again.\n"", '\n  Had to wait a bit for it to arrive (apparently people like to hoard this type of item).Thick and soft at the same time.
