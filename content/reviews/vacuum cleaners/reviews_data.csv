It works on my thick carpets, rugs, tile, even siphoning little fuzz balls or hair stuck in random places on my bathroom walls. I am obsessed! This vacuum is lightweight! I am short and ~105 lbs. so I'm really glad this is not a hunk of a machine. It is also heavy duty and the suction power is really strong. I already vacuumed over the cords once or twice because I was so excited to use this vacuum, but the cords are perfectly in tact with no issues. The black and purple one comes with a brush, an upholstery tool, and a 7 inch short crevice tool. I used the crevice tool for dust on my blinds and it worked. It really helps to use a vacuum on dust when you're allergic to dust like me. Using a duster just kicks up the little particles but this vacuum truly did a good job of sucking everything up. The dust cup is bigger than it seems. I'm so happy with this purchase and already recommended it to friends and family, especially for the price point! It is pretty loud but I'm not surprised because it packs a lot of power for being so lightweight.\n"", '\n  The vacuum sucks...which is good! It has a powerful suction and really sucks up my long, nasty hair that I leave in my carpet. It can be a bit too strong; I tried vacuuming a rug and it’ll start sucking in the whole rug itself. With great power comes great responsibility I guess.Anyway, it’s a great vacuum and I highly recommend it.\n', ""\n  PROS:Excellent Price PointEasy to assemble (literally the easiest ever)Great access to the hose attachmentsease of level adjustment (bare floor to carpet )Easy to emptyEasy on easy offCONS:The suction isn't as great as I was hoping for (other reviews)It isn't as lightweight as you think.This is not self propelled so it is very hard to push If you have any issues at all with shoulders or back. THIS IS NOT FOR YOUI regret not realizing this. I wish I would have known and paid more.I am already smelling a burning from the beltJust really do your researchI read reviews....\n"", ""\n  Needed a vacuum but didn't want to break the bank on one cause I don't have much carpet in my apartment. This one is exactly what I needed. Sucks up dust and cat hair really well and I was surprised to discover that it's actually pretty decent on hard floors too! I can't speak to the durability of it because I haven't had it long, but I've been really pleased with it so far. Set up was also very easy. If you're looking for a vacuum but aren't trying to spend a whole lot, I definitely recommend this one!\n"", ""\n  So I've been living in a studio for 6 months with no vaccume. This became problematic because I'm both asthmatic and allergic to dust. After roughly 3 months of red eye and increasing rescue inhaler hits, I resolved to stop avoiding the dreaded product research and fix this BUT THEN DISASTER STRUCK; the neighbor's hot water tank burst and flooded the adjacent half of my apartment.2 months later, I came back to half of my belongings piled on my bed, a gnat infestation, and construction dust coating LITERALLY EVERYTHING I OWNED. This vaccume's first use was combating post-apocalyptic god-knows-what-kind-of-cancer-it-causes dust cleanup (with the main body and the brush attachment) and stalking my place for gnats like some kind of starving bullfrog (with the long neck attachment). Not only was it highly efficient at both, but it's apparently gnat-tight, too.10/10 this thing is a lifesaver\n"", '\n  I have two long-haired dogs, so my carpeted areas is a nightmare! This vacuum exceeded my expectations, ESPECIALLY for the great price! I bought it expecting it to be a temporary one until I can invest in better due to the price... but this one is amazing! Highly recommend.\n', ""\n  Inexpensive vacuums are my jam! Our last one cost about $80 and lasted about 3 years. We just got this one September 2020.SUCTION - So far the suction is great! We have a dog with very fine fur. She sheds like crazy so we will be using this vacuum frequently.WEIGHT - It is very lightweight. Almost to a concerning degree. The plastic is not very sturdy. It hasn't broken but I'm definitely going to be more gentle with it than my last one.CLEANING - My last vacuum was a nightmare to empty and clean. This one is MUCH easier to clean out.CORD LENGTH - I'd say cord length is about average. I thinks it's a bit longer than my last one. I'm able to do what I need to do with it so I'm happy. I can get all the way up and down my stairs with it plugged in which is always a plus. I also LOVE that the handle can disconnect and be attached to the hose extender.I will edit as time goes on. So far, I'm very pleased with my purchase!\n"", '\n  Easy to assemble. Just slowly follow the directions in the packet.  Look at the picture of the back and where the hose connects. I was afraid to order it because every vacuum from cheap to expensive has a bad review. I was surprised this vacuumed was just what I needed! It cleaned every single random cloth particle off of my beautiful black rug. Buy it,its a great deal and its exactly what you need if you want cloth particles which smaller vacuums dont pick up off of your floor.\n', '\n  Excelente, es muy práctica, todos los accesorios que trae tienen su lugar asignado en la misma aspiradora no necesitas guardarlos en otro lugar. Se vacía muy fácilmente y sin ensuciarse, se maneja también muy fácil. Lo único que ayudaría un poquito seria que la manguera fuera un poco más larga, para poder aspirar cómodamente las cortinas pero aún así me funcionó.  Lo mejor es que el precio estuvo muy bien, me animé a comprarla solo por las opiniones que había y me uno a ellas positivamente. Espero dure mucho tiempo.\n', '\n  Muy buena aspiradora con una potencia fuerte. No pude creer cuanto polvo salió de mi tapete la primera vez que la utilicé! Mi aspiradora anterior obviamente no se compara con esta. Muy buena aspiradora! Esta perfecta para quitar los pelos de mi mascota.\n', '\n  Es muy práctica y tiene buena potencia.

I rarely write reviews but this product definitely warranted it.  I reviewed dozens of vacuums and literally read hundreds of reviews here and other consumer comparison sites.  I bought this not because of the price point (though that makes the decision easier), but because there were very little complaints about the filter system and it's cleanup and maintenance.  On many other more expensive vacuums the filter system is not convenient, nor is the access and removal simple.  If this goes wrong it will damage the motor, and that is typically non-warranty expense.  This is well-designed so that the parts that disconnect are obvious and have a logical position that is difficult to screw up.  The point being is that it comes apart and goes back together easy.  I'm sure there are vacuums with longer hoses, more suction, etc... but it cleaned up a room that hadn't been touched in a long time with minimal effort.  I can't speak to the differences in carpet thickness, etc because I have mainly hardwood, rugs, and low carpet.. but it works and works well.  I would buy it again and recommend it to anyone looking for a convenient bagless vacuum that is easy to clean/maintain.\n"", ""\n  ON THE BOX, THIS VACUUM SAYS NOTHING ABOUT BEING SPECIFICALLY FOR PETS, so I don't know why Amazon advertises it as such.  It is advertised on the box as being LIGHTWEIGHT, and that's why I bought it.I'm a middle-aged woman and this is the best vacuum I've ever used.  It is very powerful but also lightweight and easy to maneuver!  I used to dread vacuuming because my other Eureka was heavier and cumbersome.  This one glides around SO easily.  Easy to empty, also.All I can say is the way it sucks up everything on my carpets and bare floors is amazing!  Dust, human hair, dirt, everything.  Better than any vacuum I have ever used.  So easy to clean out the canister, also.I find myself vacuuming more often now and actually enjoying it!Also, I don't think this vacuum was ever intended to suck up a ton of pet hair on a daily basis as I assume some have used it for and burned out the motor doing (according to critical reviews).\n"", '\n  This vacuum worked wonders on my carpet, rugs, comforter, and couches! The attachments make it easy to clean multiple surfaces. Lightweight and the canister is easy to empty! This pic is from just ONE vacuum of my master bedroom, comforter, and living room rug! I am so pleasantly surprised by this steal of a deal. We have a roomba that we run 1-2 times a week, but with having two (large) inside dogs, summer and spring can still be rough! This is product is perfect!*Bonus* it’s light enough my 11 year old will have no issues adding vacuuming to his chores list lol!\n', '\n  JUst received today and I am absolutely 100% delighted. It comes 99% assembled right out of the box - just insert handle, attach tools, unwind cord, plug in and go, go go!  Within 5 minutes of receiving, I was vacuuming. The clear container was picking up even fine particles, hair, dirt and with efficiency.  This was EVERYTHING I was looking for without the high price tag.....  I had to replace a much pricier Hoover that I also loved until using this sweet machine. Time will tell but my initial impression is ❤️❤️❤️\n', '\n  This vacuum is amazing! We just moved into a new (to us) home and had a cheap vacuum. The last owners must have had a dog and even after vacuuming i kept finding dog hair. I ordered this vacuum and i realized how amazing it is. It has great suction and even worked on my hard wood floors. This photo is after i had vacuumed with my last vacuum 2 times this week! Was ready to use right out of the box too!\n', '\n  I simply cannot believe this vacuum. Oh sure I have had vacuums in the past, but none can hold a candle to this one. It is amazing! I feel kinda foolish lavishing all this praise on a vacuum, but let me tell you having been through many disappointments with expensive vacuums that promise you the world and then fall short, I know a good vacuum when I see one. Talk about suction power, it is amazing. (I had to be careful not to suck the dog right up. LOL) Who ever the product engineers were, they deserve a HUGE raise. Everything seems so thoughtfully done. Easy to remove a large canister to empty the dirt and the filter can be washed with soap and water. There are three attachments that fit nicely on the vacuum and you can turn it on by tapping your foot on a pedal at the base. Did I mention I love this vacuum? And you know what else? I vacuum my house at least 2 times a week, well when I got this vacuum I thought I should take it for a spin. OMG the dirt it picked up! I am a tad embarassed to say that there was a lot of dirt in the canister from my ""clean"" house. So, now we are ordering another one so I can have one at our cottage too. Oh I almost forgot to mention it is so light weight! Well, That\'s the store about this vacuum and my love affair with it.\n', '\n  We have 4 cats and a completely carpeted house. The photo above is after vacuuming only my living room, which is maybe 150sqft  at most. I can’t speak for its longevity since we haven’t had it very long but it works VERY well so far.\n', ""\n  They don't make vacuum cleaners like they used to! Unless you spend what seems like $1000 which I don't have it is hard to get a good quality vacuum. That being said, I have had good success with mine so far. With pet hair and the carpets this little vacuum does the trick! It has good suction and was super easy to put together (very few pieces). I am cautiously optimistic that this will last me longer than the last one but overall good value!\n"", '\n  it works for cleaning our area rugs and laminate floors.  we have a little 4 legged shedder and this helps us to stay on top of it.\n']"

People say the cord is short, like yea maybe but it ain’t that short lol. Like do you not have other outlets? I could do the majority of my place in one outlet. I gotta say though the brush it comes with sucks up everything. The Vacuum also was insanely strong. People say it’s hard to use on carpets because not adjustable on the brush, but I mean people use a little strength and it’s fine. Y’all act like you can’t move it. I’d rather have good suction and have to push a little harder than something that doesn’t clean. Loved this thing. Also super light-weight. If I could change a few things obviously the cord length being 18 feet instead of the normal 25 is one, but the second would be the width of the head. It’s large, but not as wide as the vacuum width as the other Eureakas. For the money though this thing is a MAJOR go.\n', '\n  I just received and used this vacuum.It is EXACTLY what I was looking for.I’m limited on space in a 2 bedroom apartment where the only carpet is in the bedrooms and an area rug in the living room. There’s just no need for me to invest in a full sized vacuum, I wouldn’t have anywhere to store it. This fits beautifully in a coat closet filled with other things. It doesn’t skimp on suction power however! I’m embarrassed at the amount of dirt I pulled up in just 3 strokes. Also, $60?!? Yes. Absolutely yes. I know it won’t last as long as an Oreck or Dyson but neither will my address! 😝My rebuttals for others’ complaints:1. The canister is small. /The cord is short.Yes. So is the ENTIRE vacuum. Lol. I appreciate the overall slim shape. It’s the exact same width as my bass guitar.2. It’s hard to push.Because the suction is great! I LOVE vacuum lines! 🥰 It really puts in work for its size.\n', '\n  Does a great job and I have 2 toddlers you you know the mess never stops\n', ""\n  Ok, the reason I'm giving it a 5, is because not only the vacuum is great, but the tech service did an amazing job as well.For the left box, it was in terrible condition, but that didn't bother me, because anything can happen while in transit. When I opened it, you can see on the left vacuum pic, it was obviously used and accessory parts were missing. So what I did, I immediately called them for a replacement.

I am a happy customer!\n', '\n  *Update: Ended up returning & exchanging this Eureka for a Dirt Devil that was similar in design & price but had bigger wheels. (And is slightly larger overall.) The Dirt Devil is easier to push around and does not have the ""drag"" caused by the Eureka wheels being too small. The Eureka was a good little vacuum otherwise! It\'s just better suited for VERY low (or no) profile carpet—like the kind you see in high-traffic places like hotels & offices... or bare floors?? I suspect my Berber carpet texture was the main challenge for this vacuum. Bummed I had to return it! ______________Not 100% sure about this vacuum yet. Got to try it out the same day I received it. I will say the suction is great, especially for a smaller vac.👍 It has a couple on-board tools & a hose for detail vacuuming.BUT... I expected it to be MUCH easier to maneuver than it is. The wheels don\'t have much ""glide"" to them. Or any glide. They kind of stick. They look too small. It\'s surprisingly hard to push this vac around the carpet. And my carpet is new and low pile.I chose this vac specifically because I have a very bad back. I needed a no-frills upright vacuum that was a bit more compact and light than others. It\'s important for me to make household chores manageable so I can maintain some modicum of independence. This vac does not help with that goal.  It\'s harder to use than my very old ""8 lb Oreck"" vacuum.Since it\'s so hard to maneuver, I won\'t be able to physically tolerate using this vacuum as often as needed. Not without help, anyway. Honestly, I\'m not sure if I should just suck it up (no pun intended, I swear!) and keep it, or return it. I could go either way at this point. 😕\n', '\n  What a powerhouse of a vacuum cleaner! Just got it delivered and used it. I am so happy with this purchase! I just had three relatives move out of my house, and unfortunately they had a dog that shed really bad. This dirt, dog dander and hair was confined to one room. Shocking, I know. I was almost too embarrassed to post the photo, but I wanted everyone to know just how awesome this vacuum is! The suction power is top notch.\n', '\n  La mía llegó incompleta, parece que le falta un tapón de la parte superior, pero no afecta su rendimiento así que no le rebajo muchas estrellas por eso. Es ruidosa, y no es la más potente, pero hace su trabajo. Se puede usar tanto en piso como alfombra, y tiene una boquilla estilo cepillo que es perfecta para remover pelo de mascota del sillón. Tengo un perro y un gato así que la uso bastante seguido. Sólo me gustaría que la manguera tuviera mayor alcance para lugares cerrados, es retráctil así que para lugares pequeños no expande mucho\n', '\n  I’m a Eureka vacuum fan, this is my third Eureka vacuum.  The first was given to me second hand and lasted a while and when something about it broke I shopped around and decided to replace it with another Eureka Airspeed.  That one recently broke - not because of the quality but because my teenagers are hard on it and a spring on the bottom lost it’s shape so it doesn’t sit flat on the floor anymore.  I replaced it with this newer model.  The suction is fantastic like all of my eureka’s have been.  The model has had a few changes, the canister opens from the bottom now for example, the hose for attachments works a little differently.  I’m not sure yet if I like the newer model or older one better.  Overall, I just like the lightweight nature with high suction of eurekas.  It’s easy enough to clean.  I often wash down the entire canister and wash the filter.  I like that it’s bagless and the filter is washable.  I have three cats and it does a good job of cleaning pet hair and dust out of carpets.  Plus the price is right.\n', '\n  Muy buen producto, de buena calidad y sirve muy bien, es ligera y se puede maniobrar bien.

Two comments.  Not quiet at all. No height adjustment for carpet. Otherwise overall great preformer\n', '\n  Wow!! What a great upright vaccum!

We have had disappointing results with inexpensive vacuums (from a different major brand). But this Bissell wow\'ed us on the first use with how much dust, lint, and animal fur it picked up from what we thought was a fairly clean carpet!It\'s lightweight for a vacuum, all plastic construction.  Not nearly as loud as other vacuums we have had.  Hardly even scares the dog. Works great on level 1 for hardwood, laminate and tile.  At these levels the head was low enough to get under most of my cabinets and vacuums right up to the wall/corner.  This vacuum is very easy to carry up and down stairs and can be carried with one hand.I appreciate the fact that you can see the brush turning and the canister filling up and that all the tools are attached to the machine.  You are more likely to use the tools if you don\'t have to search for them in a box or closet.  It did a great job picking up dog hair.I liked the little hand-held brush for getting pet hair off the couch.  Suction overall seemed very good.The head is very low profile and easily gets under our sofa and recliners.Detaching the canister to empty was a snap.  A one-button push to release it from the machine and a one but release to empty the canister into the trash.  FANTASTIC!I like the fact that I can tell it is cleaning and do not have to double check that the ""bag/canister"" is filling or that the beater brush/nozzle is turning.The only downside so far is that you have to reach down to switch from high to low (carpet-tile/hardwood).  Everything else is activated while standing.The hose for using the attachments is a little short but seems to work well for stairs.  You will have to bring the machine with you every few steps as the hose is not long enough.  I\'m not sure how well it would work to vacuum car floors, but it worked GREAT on Level 3 for all my area rugs without trying to suck them up!  When I tried it a 2nd time I just left it on Level 3 for everything and it did great.Overall, it seems like a very good machine.UPDATE: I just went out of my way to look up this review because I couldn\'t remember if I had given it 4 or 5 stars. After using it for a while, and being really impressed with how well it gets the dirt and especially the pet fur, and how easy it is to empty, I wanted to make sure I had given it a 5-star rating. I swear, this thing must manufacturer it\'s own dirt - I couldn\'t believe how much it sucked up in a room I thought was clean.As long as it proves to be durable, this is an EXCELLENT buy!!!\n', ""\n  For the price this is a great vacuum. I read the other reviews before purchasing. First off the cons of this cleaner:1. You need some strength but not too much. Attaching the hose to the bottom of the vacuum is a VERY tight fit. And adding the attachments are a very tight fit as well. You need to put muscle into it. But not too cause one could easly break one of the attachments. Be careful.2. The electrical cord hits the vacuum hose on the left side. Kinda annoying. But no big deal breaker.Pros:1. You need a Phillips screwdriver to attach the handle. And your ready to clean.2. Cleaned my rug very well. And very pleased.3. I have no carpet in my home. This vacuum cleaned my tiled floors extremely well. Very satisfied.4. It's not too heavy and easy to maneuver because of the setting..5. People who bought this vacuum complained it was to loud. It is not. And those are the same people that probably complain about the power cord because it's not a retractable cord. If you can't manually put up the cord yourself then you're probably the lazy one. But we really like this vacuum. .\n"", ""\n  First the pros. The vacuum did a very good job of picking up the dirt from my carpet. I was pretty shocked to see how much that was missed by my roomba.The cons. I didn't find assembly easy and the parts are cheaply made. I never did figure out how to plug in the piece you wrap the cord around. But the biggest disappointment is the hose. It does not stay in. You just shove it in the hole and hope it stays--there's no clip or adjustment to secure it, so it comes out pretty easily. I have to plug it back in at least twice during a normal vacuuming.\n"", '\n  It arrived an hour ago. I thought I did a pretty good job keeping my wood floors swept. It filled up completely with an ungodly amount of dog hair, me hair, and dust. Upstairs is carpented. It filled up twice. I guess my old vaccum was really lousy in comparison. No issues with using on wood floor.\n', '\n  WOW!  This is most amazing purchase.  Could not believe how much it picked up from where I had vacuumed only a few days before.  Have a new rescue dog that is a mega shedder.  I am beyond happy with this “magic carpet cleaner.” Assembly easy for 75 year old lady; operation easy, light weight, compact and great price.  Have been using Oreck which I am donating.  Bissell is my new go to vac.  Got attachment to vac dog but have not tried yet.\n', ""\n  The suction power of this vacuum far exceeds any vacuum I've ever owned. It actually added a little life to my carpets.Two changes would make this the perfect vacuum. The cleaning deck could be a little narrower to get into more areas and the power cord management is a little awkward. Neither is a deal breaker. One of the best buys on Amazon.\n"", ""\n  Going from a small apartment with wood floors and no pets to a house with carpet and a dog that sheds I knew I had to upgrade my small vacuum. I put it off for a couple months and finally ordered this vacuum....wow I couldn't believe the amount of hair it got out of my carpet, borderline embarrassing. Also even though it has a brush which usually pushes hair around on hardwood floors, this vacuum seems to do pretty well on those also.\n"", '\n  I bought this for my business - we fabricate vinyl railing and fencing and sell to contractors, so between the tiny vinyl particles that get tracked into the office and the dirt and mud the contractors track in, we have put this vaccuum to the test!

Since hardwood floors arrived and I only have one bedroom with carpet (keeps the noise down) it is not as enjoyable to vacuum the entire house with a larger and heavier vacuum.So my search finally decided on the Eureka NEN110A Whirlwind Bagless Canister Vacuum Cleaner and I am glad I did.  It arrived yesterday after ordering it only Friday, thanks Amazon.  Needless to say, I had to take it for a spin.  Here is what I can report for the newly arrived.1. It is pretty.  Yes, pretty; I don't like ugly appliances.  All the bells and whistles are great, but if the unit is ugly, then I don't want it.  You know what I am talking about, you seen other vacuum cleaners that look like they jumped out of a 1950 sci-fi movie.  Hello, the commercial vacuum that is short, round and has eye's painted on it, or the Shark Apex or the Shark DuoClean Powered Lift Away Speed Vacuum that looks like a tower that could easily fall over, or almost all Oreck.  Oh yes, I know this may step on a toe or toe, but sometimes the truth is ugly and hey, this is my review.But this unit is good looking, racey, futuristic even, and I love the color blue they made it in.2. Power - plenty of suction power.  As a matter of fact I had to adjust back the vacuum power using the handy built in suction adjustment on the hand.  No problem with suction power.3. Ease of use - this is were it really shines.  It is around 8 pounds so it is quick and easy to maneuver all over the house.  Easy to get down under furniture as the head swivels around, turning and twisting your floors clean.  The dust cup is small, but so is the vacuum cleaner, but it is easy to pop out and dump, snap closed and your ready to go.  I hate when people whine about having to empty the canister so often, seriously, why do you want to leave all that dirt in the vacuum for days.  It even easily rolls over its own power cord.  My Kenmore canister that weighed over 20 pounds couldn't even roll over its own cord, it would get stuck and I would have to lift it.4. The built into the wand brush and crevice tool worked really well also.  The wand, the handles plug securely into each other and the vacuum with a nice little snap.  Easy to undo also.  The auto-rewind on the unit is great too, a nice feature at this price point.  The power cord is 16 feet, but if it was possible to have another five feet would be awesome, but I am not complaining, I just unplug and move to another area and plug into a different outlet that is closer to the work area, after all our houses come with multiple outlets.5.  Lifespan, this is always the unknown, but the unit has a one year manufacturer warranty and I purchased 3 more years under the Assurance plan.  So I feel I am covered.  Time will tell and I'll update these comments if something goes wrong and also if the unit keeps working just fine.\n"", ""\n  I was skeptical when I was looking to purchase a new vacuum because this was so small and inexpensive.  However, this one is the best vacuum I've ever owned!  The suction power, ease of use and barely weighs anything have impressed me.  You do have to purchase the tools separately but they were under $9.00 for the set.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!These are the tools I purchased.https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L1SKINI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1This is the hardwood floor attachment I purchased.

I don't see it lasting long.  I purchased this Eureka vacuum for my home cleaning businesses specifically because it has the metal parts.  It is phenomenal!  I love the way this thing works - suction is excellent.  It is sturdy, even the plastic components are good, heavy duty plastic and not that thin flimsy stuff.  I love that it is super light (I have to carry it in and out, up and down).  I also really like how the arm is collapsible so that it fits in my cargo area better.  OH and the best feature - the little brush attached to the arm - you just quickly separate the two metal parts, push down the brush and quickly vacuum / dust baseboards!!!!  OMG that is a game changer!!  (No more crawling on my hands and knees to wipe the baseboards unless I'm being paid to wet wipe them!)\n"", ""\n  I loved. Very light. Long electric cable. Perfect for small apartments with carpet and hard floors. I have a dog and he also collected his hair very well. I can't ask for more, for that price.\n"", ""\n  I like it for the ability to use on hardwood floors.  Much easier for a tall person than trying to use attachments on an upright.  However, one of the selling features by the vendor is it's ability to run on carpets.  It does not.  I can't even get it to go forwards; only cleans if I drag it backwards.  Made all possible adjustments & still totally worthless on carpet.  Now I have to buy a new upright.  Very poor advertising & product description.\n"", '\n  Omg! Now we’re cooking with fire! I had an old upright vacuum that I had been using that was heavy, clunky, and finally falling apart. I got this hoping it would be a good fit for my one bedroom apartment. I just used it for the first time and CANNOT believe the suction in this little guy! I have hard wood floors, a few area rugs, linoleum in the kitchen and tile in the bathroom. This thing cleaned my house up in a quarter of the time it used to take me with the upright vacuum.It’s soooo easy to put together and clean up is a snap.Be forewarned though, the suction on this thing is no joke. It lifted my area rugs off the floor! I’m not bothered though because it picked up so much stuff.I can’t believe I waited this long to get a canister vacuum. I will never go upright again!\n', '\n  It seems like a nice enough vacuum but it does not come with a crevice tool.  The owners manual that came with mine clearly shows a crevice tool, but the picture is not of the same vacuum.  Eureka confirmed for me that the new ‘improved’ model has a combination tool built into the handle, but this is just a brush that slides back and forth.  It does not turn into a crevice tool and it cannot be removed to attach to the hose or wand as stated in the manual..  They did inform me that we could buy a crevice tool extra.  If you have red reviews that mention the great little crevice tool, this isn’t the same.\n', '\n  Great product, I just got it and used it to clean my room. The section power is very strong I wish it had spinning brushes but it doesn’t . Other then that it’s a compact product and am happy with my new vacuum\n', '\n  This vacuum is fine but after paying over $100.00 on Amazon.ca saw it at Walmart for $59.99. Feeling  very ripped off.\n', '\n  For what it is sold for, I was very impressed! It is so light, has great suction power, easy to empty/clean. The bristles from the brush could be firmer and also it seems like the suction changes when the vacuum is picked up . But really, I would buy it again. I have 3 cats and it does a great job at sucking hair and litter!\n', '\n  This small space vacuum is great for my apartment floors.  The suction is good and so far is doing what it should be doing.  I also like that it a quiet machine.  The easy remove dust bin makes it a breeze to clean up after the cleaning deed.\n', '\n  I never write Amazon reviews but I need to warn people of this vacuum because of the deceptively positive reviews. The vacuum worked great initially but after 2 months I found myself cleaning the canister and filter 2-3 times during a single vacuuming session. There’s a flimsy filter between the canister and hose and it clogs constantly messing up the suction and making it much less effective. 6 months in and the on/off button no longer works - it turns on but does not turn off no matter how many times I push it - I have to unplug it to turn off. Also there’s no rotating brush on the carpet attachment so not great for pet hair at all. TL;dr after a few months you have to clean canister and rinse filter mesh ***constantly***\n', '\n  Exactement ce que j’espérais!Il y a du tapis partout dans mon logement, à l’exception de la cuisine et la salle de bain et je suis impressionnée par la puissance d’aspiration sur le tapis et les meubles.

We have had disappointing results with inexpensive vacuums (from a different major brand). But this Bissell wow\'ed us on the first use with how much dust, lint, and animal fur it picked up from what we thought was a fairly clean carpet!It\'s lightweight for a vacuum, all plastic construction.  Not nearly as loud as other vacuums we have had.  Hardly even scares the dog. Works great on level 1 for hardwood, laminate and tile.  At these levels the head was low enough to get under most of my cabinets and vacuums right up to the wall/corner.  This vacuum is very easy to carry up and down stairs and can be carried with one hand.I appreciate the fact that you can see the brush turning and the canister filling up and that all the tools are attached to the machine.  You are more likely to use the tools if you don\'t have to search for them in a box or closet.  It did a great job picking up dog hair.I liked the little hand-held brush for getting pet hair off the couch.  Suction overall seemed very good.The head is very low profile and easily gets under our sofa and recliners.Detaching the canister to empty was a snap.  A one-button push to release it from the machine and a one but release to empty the canister into the trash.  FANTASTIC!I like the fact that I can tell it is cleaning and do not have to double check that the ""bag/canister"" is filling or that the beater brush/nozzle is turning.The only downside so far is that you have to reach down to switch from high to low (carpet-tile/hardwood).  Everything else is activated while standing.The hose for using the attachments is a little short but seems to work well for stairs.  You will have to bring the machine with you every few steps as the hose is not long enough.  I\'m not sure how well it would work to vacuum car floors, but it worked GREAT on Level 3 for all my area rugs without trying to suck them up!  When I tried it a 2nd time I just left it on Level 3 for everything and it did great.Overall, it seems like a very good machine.UPDATE: I just went out of my way to look up this review because I couldn\'t remember if I had given it 4 or 5 stars. After using it for a while, and being really impressed with how well it gets the dirt and especially the pet fur, and how easy it is to empty, I wanted to make sure I had given it a 5-star rating. I swear, this thing must manufacturer it\'s own dirt - I couldn\'t believe how much it sucked up in a room I thought was clean.As long as it proves to be durable, this is an EXCELLENT buy!!!\n', ""\n  For the price this is a great vacuum. I read the other reviews before purchasing. First off the cons of this cleaner:1. You need some strength but not too much. Attaching the hose to the bottom of the vacuum is a VERY tight fit. And adding the attachments are a very tight fit as well. You need to put muscle into it. But not too cause one could easly break one of the attachments. Be careful.2. The electrical cord hits the vacuum hose on the left side. Kinda annoying. But no big deal breaker.Pros:1. You need a Phillips screwdriver to attach the handle. And your ready to clean.2. Cleaned my rug very well. And very pleased.3. I have no carpet in my home. This vacuum cleaned my tiled floors extremely well. Very satisfied.4. It's not too heavy and easy to maneuver because of the setting..5. People who bought this vacuum complained it was to loud. It is not. And those are the same people that probably complain about the power cord because it's not a retractable cord. If you can't manually put up the cord yourself then you're probably the lazy one. But we really like this vacuum. .\n"", ""\n  First the pros. The vacuum did a very good job of picking up the dirt from my carpet. I was pretty shocked to see how much that was missed by my roomba.The cons. I didn't find assembly easy and the parts are cheaply made. I never did figure out how to plug in the piece you wrap the cord around. But the biggest disappointment is the hose. It does not stay in. You just shove it in the hole and hope it stays--there's no clip or adjustment to secure it, so it comes out pretty easily. I have to plug it back in at least twice during a normal vacuuming.\n"", '\n  It arrived an hour ago. I thought I did a pretty good job keeping my wood floors swept. It filled up completely with an ungodly amount of dog hair, me hair, and dust. Upstairs is carpented. It filled up twice. I guess my old vaccum was really lousy in comparison. No issues with using on wood floor.\n', '\n  WOW!  This is most amazing purchase.  Could not believe how much it picked up from where I had vacuumed only a few days before.  Have a new rescue dog that is a mega shedder.  I am beyond happy with this “magic carpet cleaner.” Assembly easy for 75 year old lady; operation easy, light weight, compact and great price.  Have been using Oreck which I am donating.  Bissell is my new go to vac.  Got attachment to vac dog but have not tried yet.\n', ""\n  The suction power of this vacuum far exceeds any vacuum I've ever owned. It actually added a little life to my carpets.Two changes would make this the perfect vacuum. The cleaning deck could be a little narrower to get into more areas and the power cord management is a little awkward. Neither is a deal breaker. One of the best buys on Amazon.\n"", ""\n  Going from a small apartment with wood floors and no pets to a house with carpet and a dog that sheds I knew I had to upgrade my small vacuum. I put it off for a couple months and finally ordered this vacuum....wow I couldn't believe the amount of hair it got out of my carpet, borderline embarrassing. Also even though it has a brush which usually pushes hair around on hardwood floors, this vacuum seems to do pretty well on those also.\n"", '\n  I bought this for my business - we fabricate vinyl railing and fencing and sell to contractors, so between the tiny vinyl particles that get tracked into the office and the dirt and mud the contractors track in, we have put this vaccuum to the test! It is so light and works so well - highly recommended!!\n']"

The brains Dyson added to this vaccuum, along with the bigger battery capacity, have immensley added to the vacuum time I get on a charge.  I am leaving it set on Auto, and It is darn near twice the square feet I am getting vacuumed on a single charge.  I just leave it up to the vaccuum to set the power as I go from carpet to hard wood to stone.  Well done Dyson.I have been using, for the past year or so, a V8 Animal that I bought for about $325 on sale at my local membership warehouse store.  And I absolutely love it.  It is far and away the best cordless vacuum I have ever used.  But I can only get 1/2 my house  cleaned before it goes dead.  So I wanted to get another cordless to have one upstairs and one downstairs.  Enter the V11 Animal.  And the V11 is another outstanding cordless vacuum.Compared to the V8, the V11 is more powerful and lasts quite a bit longer on a charge.  And honestly, that would be my expectation for a new model being introduced.  Where does the V11 really stand out compared to the V8?  The best improvement is the \'Auto"" setting.  The V11 adjusts its suction for the floor it is being used on.  On carpet, it turns up the suction for a deeper clean.  And when it rolls off onto the hardwood it dials back.  I don\'t know how it does it but it does it well.  I found it cleaned every surface effortlessly and well.  With the V8, I have to flip the switch to low when I get to the gel mats in the kitchen or It will suck the brush head down so hard the brushes would stop rolling.  And with the V8, I always used high on the hardwood because it picked up so much better than low - but drained the battery very quickly.The extra power of the V11 does add size and weight to the vacuum, but not too much.  The battery is a bit bigger, the motor is a bit bigger and the filter is bigger.  Both the V8 and the V11 can get a bit tiring for high vacuuming.  Like the V8, the V11 filter is easily accessible for cleaning.Hats off to Dyson for keeping the attachments with the same fittings.  The V8 and V11 attachments are interchangeable.  But the lack of two attachments with the V11 added to my 4 star rating.  The V8 animal came with a soft dusting brush and, most importantly, an 90 degree adjustable elbow tube.  That tube is a big deal because it is really the only way to avoid getting out a ladder to vacuum the top of a valance or other high object with a flat top.  One thing I absolutely love about the cordless concept is the ability to stand flat footed on the floor and vacuum the top of my drapery, and you have to have a 90 degree elbow to do that.  At this price, Dyson should be throwing those two attachments in.  Thank goodness, the attachments are interchangeable.In the end, the V11 wins in ease of use, power and battery life.  At $200 more that the V8, those improvements come at a hefty price.  So what keeps the V11 from 5 stars is the missing attachments and the price.\n', ""\n  It was time to replace our old Dyson cord vacuum. I think it was 17 years old. Since it had performed so well over the years, I immediately looked to Dyson again. I admit I was a bit skeptical that a smaller stick vacuum could do the job in an almost 2000 sq ft house. We are senior citizens who have an active lifestyle, live in the mountains off of dusty roads, have house cats and 2 Aussie dogs. Since we also have horses and acreage, we are busy and the cleaning sometimes takes a lower priority. I wanted something that was easy to use, quick, and not having to drag a cord around sounded really good! Hubby thought I was making a big mistake. But, after assembling it and using it today, he has changed his mind, and I really, really like this handy and powerful vacuum. Some of the features take a bit of getting used to, like taking the tube with the power head off to dump the bin. In fact, I was concerned about the small size of the bin, and how often I might need to dump it. But after using it to vacuum most of the house, I'm no longer concerned. I'm used to it now, and it takes just a moment. And...it did a great job, our area rugs look great, and it moves so easily to our hardwood floors. One really big plus for us is that it runs off battery charge. We live off the grid and generate our own electricity with solar and wind. On cloudy, windless days, I was basically forbidden to vacuum, unless I started a generator. But now, I can have a charge ready and get it done! Couldn't be happier. If, having using this for a time we find something to change our opinion, I will edit my review to reflect it. Can definitely recommend this product!\n"", '\n  The motorhead does not spin, took 14 days (and 10+ hours of wait time to speak to Dyson) to get a replacement . The replacement has the same issue - so waiting again on hold. WORST PRODUCT EVER!\n', ""\n  UPDATED:  Dyson's customer service is outstanding! It has to be best I have ever experienced.  They are sending me a replacement unit as they don't want to take a chance of the engineering being out of whack if I use my V11 without the spacer/disc. They are reporting this issue to their engineers to get to the bottom of it.  In the meanwhile I have been vacuuming like crazy after beach days and removing the sand so effectively in the house it's a pleasure walking on the hard woods.  I love this vacuum, it's so much fun to run, I have also discovered that the top of the unit can rest on counters in between touch ups pretty stable so if I don't have the home base hanger around there is that option although I probably wouldn't risk doing that when their are kids/dogs in the house.First review:I really wanted to wait before posting this review so I could use it more, but after reading other reviews for clues I realize this is an ongoing issue and I wanted to warn others!Before unboxing I read the directions including these:NOTES UPON RECEIVING/UNBOXING:* Charge for 4.5 hours or until 100%* On the cleaner head, there is a red toggle switch in the front. Place the switch in the middle setting. This setting is ideal for everyday cleans to pick up larger debris and fine dust.I was so excited to start this baby up after charging it overnight, I have only experience with Dyson via my hair dryer which I love, love, love, so I was really anticipating using this vacuum.  I started it up and was delighted with how the different modes self adjust as needed, the boost mode is amazing and really sucks up the fine sand that gets tracked into our beach house.  After vacuuming one room, I noticed the brush heads were not spinning. I am not sure if they ever spun at all, so I took apart the brush head as shown in the manual, as another reviewer has commented I had difficulty putting the brush head sheath back on --I didn't force it but I kept trying to get it to go back and have the end piece be flush so I could screw the coin screw part back on.  I finally got it but still no joy in getting the brush heads to spin. After I looked on the Dyson website for troubleshooting tips and there were no options for this problem, I called Dyson, the customer service gave an option to call me back and they did within one minute.  The woman started walking me through steps to troubleshoot and I suddenly saw that at the base of the shaft which the torque head cleaner head sheath slides onto there is a little dark gray flimsy looking plastic disc/ring and it was broken.  The customer service kind of offended me by trying to suggest that I should have used a screwdriver (I had mentioned I needed to grab one but it was a flat head used only to flip the coin screw cap gently!).  She did immediately offer to send an entire new cleaning head.  I was bummed that I couldn't play with my new gadget as it had still worked pretty darn well without the brush heads spinning! I decided to vacuum with the small car/upholstery head and found it works really well on stairs and small spaces. In the meantime, I looked to see what other reviewers had said because I kind of felt bad that maybe I had done something to break this piece of fine technology!  I was vindicated when I saw others have already experienced the same issue.  Someone had mentioned they took out the broken pieces of the disc/ring and since the customer service didn't mention returning the cleaning head I decided to try it and sure enough after removing with pliers the vac is running smoothly.  NOTE: I don't know if doing this will void the warranty, I recommend calling Dyson and telling them this is a known issue and this little disc/ring is the culprit.  I don't know if this is a clue but the disc/ring/spacer? thingy had a recycle symbol on it.  Maybe this is a clue that this piece is supposed to be taken off and disposed of in recycling before being shipping to consumers?So now I have two thoughts: As another reviewer mentioned, is this ring/disc important for function,will this harm the motor if I run it without?  The second thought is COULD this be a part that is meant for shipping and and is meant to be removed?  Doesn't sound right but I wonder because the vac is running super smooth without.So on to the review, this could be four star review if the above issue hadn't popped up.  I love the suction on this vacuum it is AMAZING--beachhouse sand, Aussie dog fur, all sucked up on boost mode perfectly.  The hardwood floors are squeaky clean right now!  I love the LCD screen telling me which mode and how much battery life.  I love the ease of use and weight is not too heavy even for a petite person.  What I didn't love so much is that there is no self standing option but you can't have it all--I would hate for this vac to fall down when I have to stop for a minute.  I also wish there was an option for a charging cradle at the base so I could move where I put the base charger.  My house doesn't have electricity in the small closet space and I don't want to put the charging mount out in the open.  This may not be an issue for others but just keep in mind that you need a space with an electrical outlet nearby.  For now I am just taking the motor off the head and vacuum stick when charging so I know it doesn't fall anywhere or trip up anyone lying on the floor.\n"", '\n  Il prodotto è fantastico, potenza di aspirazione elevata, chiaramente se usata al massimo la batteria dura poco, ma usata alla velocità medico eco i risultati sono notevoli.
