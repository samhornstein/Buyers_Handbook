They do not despite the description. I have the Airpods Pro 2 and these are almost an exact replica. The beep when you touch the stem is way too loud and the process for controlling the volume on them does not work for me. Press and hold the stem for 3.5 seconds and then press the left stem to turn the volume down and the right stem to turn the volume up. This does not work and in the meantime you are getting the overly loud beep in your ear. They only come with ONE set of ear covers so if you need a smaller or larger cover, you're out of luck. Unfortunately these will be going back.\n"", '\n  Always wanted a set of this type of earbuds but was not prepared to pay the exorbitant prices that the main supplier of these earbuds charges.I realise that this set of earbuds simply won\'t match up to the \'other\' supplier but this particular set surprised me for quality of sound and comfort!The earbuds come in simple packaging, which generally means that the company spend their effort i producing a product that will be fit for purpose.The earbuds themselves look and feel like a much dearer rivals,They sit neatly in the outer area of the ear drum and form a suitable seal to block out any ambient noise.Although I could have used them right away I decided to follow the manufacturers advice and charged them fully before operation.Connection to my phone was a simple affair - just took the earbuds from their case, put them in my ear and went to the Bluetooth menu on the phone - the earbuds appeared immediately that the bluetooth search feature activated and connection was just a simple, ""pairing now"" process.Once connected I opened a radio channel and the buds sprung into action.The sound wasn\'t tin-like - it was good clear audio with a reasonable amount of bass!!I adjusted the volume up and down with the phone and the buds responded immediately - the volume is sufficient to allow even the fairly hard of hearing to enjoy a loud enough quality of sounds that was not distorted and something that could be enjoyed.All in all I am happy enough to give this pair of earbuds a 5 star rating - for cost, being not too expensive to buy - for quality, which is good enough to be rigid and feel solid in the hand - for looks and finally, for sound quality!Obviously they are not made for those who require exquisitely produced sound but they are made with the ordinary earbud user in mind, whether you simply enjoy sitting listening to music or podcasts, or whether you would like to wear them at the gym or outside training!!A*****\n', '\n  Bought these to keep in the car as the kids are always leaving their earphones at home and then want to listen to whatever kids watch on iPads these days. These are a life saver to have in the car as it means I don’t need to be subjected to TikTok or YouTube clips on the journey. The kids have EarPods but say they can’t really tell much difference between them and these. They are a slightly different shape so you can tell they are not the Apple EarPods, but both kids say they are great sound quality and also are comfortable to wear. Battery life so far has been impressive with 2 x 2 hour car journeys (there and back) and they are still showing as having full battery. The little usb c cable that comes with it will be handy as well for charging the case.Great value and kids are really happy with them.\n', '\n  Purchased to replace my standard corded ear buds, for when I go running. My First pair of wireless buds and very easy to setup. Paired straight away with my smartphone.Ear buds are marked left and right, they charge up in small matchbox size storage box. Small USB c charger lead supplied buds charged up really quickly. Have used for music and phone calls, ear buds are comfortable and easy to control, with a simple press on the side, perfect for every day use or the gym. VERY COMPACT, GREAT SOUND AND LIGHTWEIGHT, GREAT VALUE,  SIT IN YOUR EAR PERFECTLY.\n', ""\n  Tried a friends airpods when we went for a run, found them really useful so did a bunch of research and found these to be the best budget android ones!Once you get these you MUST DOWNLOAD THE APP if you want to take full advantage of them. The app on the playstore is called QCY, and this pair is v7 I believe. When you first open the app theres a bunch of Chinese, just asking for permissions though so close that and my phone gave me a prompt to give the necessary permissions. One thing you'll need to do to get the best sound is turn up the bass, and turn up the volume to max. You can change a bunch of settings here like turning off the ear sensors and changing the functionality of the touch sensors on the sides.Honestly, once I'd fiddled around with the settings they seemed pretty much as good as the airpods to me, only downside is they do leak quite a bit of sound. If you don't really care about this then I Would defo recommend!\n"", '\n  I gave these to my early teens daughter to review against the Anker wireless buds“It has a long battery life and is easy to charge. Would have preferred if they were more secure in the ear. Worry they may fall out. Sound quality is good. Better fit would’ve improve soundproofing better. Overall they are good quality and touch features are very useful. The stopping when one ear piece falls out is useful”Schoolchildren will lose earbuds. That’s a given. So these present really good value for how much they offer over more expensive buds. I would recommend.\n']"

All premium feel that can finally stand up by itself. The curve glass in previous models were impressive but now, with a flat/rounded design, this allows the screen’s borders to be reduced (creating another leap into a future Bezel-less screen).• It’s also built very solid. Because of the square design, the grip on this is fantastic. This is the first time since the iPhone 4 I can feel a little more at an ease of not getting a case for it (But still do!..More on this later).• The matte back texture leaves no fingerprints whatsoever.• The biggest selling point for me is the cameras. There are hundreds of reviews on the camera quality and honestly, a picture is worth a thousand words. Let me just say that these cameras excellent (Some info below).• Night Mode to me is the biggest gem of this phone. You can be almost in pure darkness and you’ll still be able to get a decent shot. This isn’t just for the back cameras, but the Night Mode works for the front end as well. You know you have a great camera when you no longer see those little exposure pixels when the lighting is poor. Well done Apple. Well done.• The night mode will also automatically turn on. Didn’t have to do a single thing. I just pointed to an area with little lighting and the phone does the rest.• Autofocus was spot on in speed and accuracy. Taking group photos, or even me taking a selfie behind a “semi-busy crowd,” it found me without a hitch. You have to thank the lidar scanner because it allows the camera to spot the main person/people very quickly. With my friend’s iPhone 11, we noticed the difference right away when we took a picture with both his and this phone at night. The lidar scanner help grabs the focus of my shots way faster than my friend’s iPhone 11. This also was extremely effective when we were doing some short video shots.• Deep Fusion for lighting issues, Smart HDR 3 for accurate colors, I feel it’s insane to call it just a camera phone, because it’s a lot more than that.• The facetime camera also gives an HD image when you see yourself on the screen. It’s nowhere near the cameras in the back, but still very impressive.• Taking random shots around my neighborhood, I was treated with a solid dynamic range as Dolby Vision HDR delivers the most colorful footage by far on a phone (haven’t tried Google’s Pixels yet).• OLED screen panel is finally here and it’s well worth the wait. Took it outside on a clear sunny day and this screen held its ground. The colors pop dramatically and the blacks are solid. Overall an A.• If you have the previous lighting to USB cables from older iPhones, you can still use them.• The magnet system isn’t much in use now but the reason why it’s a pro is that this feature is going to open up a whole new market of accessories from third-party companies.• For the screen size, I was able to reach 80% of the screen by using just one hand. Note: My hands are normal size and if you have small hands then you’re probably only going to be able to reach 40%-60% of the screen with one hand.• IP68 water resistance, 6 meters (19.7 feet). That is equal to dropping this phone in the low end of a pool and picking it up at the bottom of it. Also, the iPhone 11 was only for 2-meters (6.5 feet).• Everything, and I mean everything, opens up in a breeze. I played NBA 2K21 and the graphics are not only top-notch, but surprisingly the phone was not heating up more than the iPhone 11. I played for about 10 minutes and overall the phone was lukewarm at most. The iPhone 11 gives you a hot experience after that time, so a big thumbs up for the 12.• One great benefit of the 12 Pro is the 6GB of RAM, compared to just 4GB in the regular 12. To be realistic you will not see much of a difference in speed. But over time this extra RAM will come in useful as wear and tear will become a factor for the internal software of these phones.• Battery life is pretty accurate in what Apple has been stating. I’m getting around a day and a half of use before charging it. I’ll assume that the battery use will increase as I slowly get used to this phone and no longer need to use it as much as I can.• To save battery power there is a unique software on the phone called Smart Data. FYI. 5G does take a lot of battery power and instead of having it on all time, when you’re not using it, Smart Data can balance the phone in speed and power. If you’re not near a 5G brand, then the phone will go back to 4G, saving battery life for you. You do have the option of overriding this feature and make it only 5G all time but, depending where you live, you’re just killing your battery life without needing to.• If you’re able to use 5G, you’re in for a treat. 5G is crazy fast compare to the 4G we all use (more on the below).Cons and Oks:__________• The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are almost the same in every way. The only thing is the camera setup. With the price bump, you expect maybe a higher refresh rate or more unique software features. If you don’t take pictures with your phone, the 12 Pro isn’t worth it.• I notice that the magnets are not strong on this phone. There enough to connect to a charger, but it will not hold if the magnets are the only thing holding it up from the ground. Hopefully third party companies will add magnets in their designs for car holders and any other attachments.• I tried the wallet feature and it’s useless. First, you’re only able to fit a few cards in it. Second, taking it in and out of your pocket, the magnets are not able to hold the wallet. The wallet will either stay in the pocket or come off when putting it away. A serious red flag if you’re out and about.• The one issue I have with the camera is the limited optical zoom. With all the software features I would expect more where other phones (Note 20) already go up to 5x.• Decent sound. Loud, not much bass, as expected. They’re enough to watch Netflix on it, but not enough for you to say “wow, the sound is fantastic!”• No charger in the box. I know Apple has stated it was for environmental issues, but you can’t help and wonder if it was just to cut costs. Either way, not a fan.• The steel rounded edges are pretty at first, but my fingerprints are now everywhere. I wish they apply the matte finish on these areas. My advice gets a case or skin to cover it.• As mention before, you need to get a case because the repairs on this phone are ridiculously high. Over $200 to replace the glass. The phone is sturdy but the repair prices are what I’m afraid of.• The new IPad Airs have the fingerprint scanner on the power button. Still have no idea why Apple doesn’t apply this feature on their phones. The face recognition software still has its limit, and there haven’t been any improvements for the 12 model.• Elephant in the room, the notch is still there. I would not mind if they kill the face recognition software to have a full screen. I know that’s the reason why we still get the notch.• Apple screen called “Ceramic Shield” only is effective when you drop your phone. I accidentally put my keys and phone in the same pocket. The result was some super tiny scratches on the screen. Be warned, the “Ceramic Shield” only is effective when you drop your phone.• I don’t have 5G in my area so the main feature isn’t in use for me. To be honest I think the 5G was a little too early. Apple should have given us a higher refresh rate of 120HZ instead. I understand that having both of them would reduce the battery life greatly, but 5G will not be fully ready to all in a year or two. The iPhone 13 should’ve been the 5G model, and the iPhone 12 should’ve been the 120 HZ screen model. It’s a big letdown since many of you, including me, will not experience this software feature until it comes to our towns/cities.• FYI: 5G is a battery killer. It may be fast, but it greatly reduces the phone's battery.• Even the Google Pixel has a 90Hz display, come one Apple. At least bring it in the Pro versions. Sadly here we are.• Warning: the Apple magnet charger accessory connects to the phone well, but I notice that it’s metal on metal when connecting. Over time I can see a lot of scratches if you’re using the magnet charger. Just another reason to get a case.• I know 90Hz 120Hz would’ve been great to have, but if you’ve never seen that display before you don’t need to be let down. The OLED on this phone is fantastic. It just stinks for those who know what 90Hz 120Hz looks like, and the 60Hz Apple still has.• Keep in mind that the Dolby Vision videos you make on this phone will not look nearly as good on screens that are not compatible. The compatible ones are the screens that few have.Bottom Line:__________To be clear, the iPhone 12 will be one of the best phones for 2021. It’s the fast, beautiful OLED screen, and it brings back the iPhone 4, 4s, and 5’s round square design (which is the best design Apple has made). This is a phone that you’re going to have for 3+years, and it will still hold its ground during those future years. I’ve always been a fan of Google’s pixels cameras because of their camera software. But Apple went above and beyond with their cameras, and I felt every shot was worth posting. For newbies to Apple, this is a great phone to get into.Still, I’m a little upset that the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are almost the same. With the “Pro” status, you expect a little more than another built-in camera. With the exception of the additional 2 GB of RAM, both phones are the same (this includes the battery). No notch removal, 90 or 120HZ screen, and not even a charger brick. I felt that Apple has more in the tank but wants to wait until the next iPhone to apply the features that we want now.In the end, if you’re into video making and/or photography get the 12 Pro. Not interested in that stuff, stick to the 12 and save “some” money. The point of Apple products is for consumers to use them in years to come, and this iPhone is no exception. Some of us may still need to wait for 5G in our area, but I believe the iPhone 12 is still a top 3 phone of 2021.Overall: A beautiful phone with a camera system that shows Apple at its finest.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer\n"", '\n  almost no one used cricket. this is really dumb\n', '\n  VERY DISAPPOINTED .

If it self destructs on me in the next few weeks I’ll update this.UPDATE: It's been a few months and a trip overseas since I wrote that initial review, and it remains a solid decision I'm very happy with.\n"", '\n  The iPhone 7 I purchased was ""certified refurbished"" and labeled as ""new"" quality but doesn\'t work. The phone looks great, but when I first turned it on it was in a restart loop. This was a bad sign to begin with, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and connected it to my computer. When I finally got it to restore to factory settings, the screen started glitching to the point where there was nothing to stop it, and if it did get to the startup screen, it was non-responsive.The shipping took a few days, but at least it came when scheduled.I have been unable to make contact with the company, but I will update my review if they are able to fix the issue and if I receive a working phone.Update: Ended up returning the phone and purchasing elsewhere. The company was cooperative with the return. Of course this could have been a one-off issue\n', '\n  It’s a scam!!  The screen doesn’t respond properly so and the battery dies within one hour.  I highly  recommend that NO ONE gets this product and it should be taken off Amazon immediately. I don’t want everyone to make the same mistake I did by buying this horrible product.\n', ""\n  I am very disappointed!!! I've ordered and had success with a previous refurbished phone.  However, this iphone 7 with 128 GB was stated as unlocked, which it was.  It was stated that it was Verizon compatible.  It clearly was not.  The Verizon techs stated that the system on this phone had to be from another country whose systems are totally incompatible with US carrier systems.  We spent hours at the Verizon store just to have to purchase a brand new phone from them.  I watched.  They tried everything to make my refurbished work.  Very frustrated and never doing this refurbished phone thing again.\n"", ""\n  This phone is not Verizon compatible! The side of the package says UNLK/T-Mobile. Tried to activate it anyways and it couldn't be.\n"", ""\n  Returning. For one, it was not an unlocked phone. I've had it for a month and the screen has started going black every few minutes, and sometimes it freaks out and tells me I have no way to connect to wifi or cell coverage (despite being somewhere with wifi and usually 4G). I'm returning before the problems escalate.Note- it doesn't come with a charger or with headphones.\n"", ""\n  This arrived 2 DAYS after I ordered it. It came much earlier than expected which is amazing! I see many reviews that say it isn't compatible with different networks but it worked perfectly when I activated it with Sprint. And despite its price it works great! It's not slow and the battery doesn't drain too quickly or anything like that. I, honestly, highly recommend this product!! 5 Stars all the way!\n"", '\n  I bought this phone based off carrier compatibility. It is clearly stated that this phone will work with Verizon Wireless. After 2 hours on the phone with tech support, they finally let us know that this (t-moble) phone will only work on the (t-mobile and ATT) networks.\n', ""\n  Soit-disant le téléphone est certifié reconditionné.Pourtant l'article fait état d'une défectuosité évident et flagrante.Le haut parleur du haut (celui d'écoute à l'oreille) ne fonctionne pas du tout.L'article a probablement été repris sans être testé du tout par le vendeur.\n"", '\n  El móvil viene en una cajita que está bien protegida, el cargador suelto dentro de la bolsa de la empresa de mensajería.El exterior se ve bien, de calidad, pero le faltarían unos dibujitos en la parte trasera del móvil característicos de Apple.La pantalla es original; la he comparado con una que no.El cargador no es el original, es ligeramente más grande. La batería está al 100%, en ocasiones se sobrecalienta, pero le daré el beneficio de la duda, ya que los primeros días puede ser por la instalación de todos los programas y se puede sobrecargar.Al comprobar si era iPhone, sí, lo es, pero comprado en otro país, por tanto, la garantía que le corresponde es de la propia empresa que vende a través de Amazon. He contactado con la empresa, ya que dicen que se haga primero antes de acudir a Amazon, y responden bastante rápido; la pega es que para una inspección de sus técnicos, se debe pagar un envío a Roma, Italia.De momento, funciona bien, me lo quedaré un par de días a ver si sigue igual; si lo acabo devolviendo, cambiaré la valoración y pondré los motivos.\n', ""\n  The phone is not good.The battery peak power is only 88% and it won't last long.Plus the Sim Card drawer is defective and can't close to the end.The lock button and the volume buttons are not steady in place and they move in their sockets.Overall is a bad experience\n"", '\n  El dispositivo que recibí estaba en una caja blanca, no la oficial. No traía auriculares ni instrucciones.Al intentar cargarlo, no cargaba. La batería se mantenía constante en un 1 %.Tras varias comunicaciones con el vendedor, conseguí que me reembolsaran el dinero. No lo recomendaría.\n', '\n  Se non fosse stato per il prezzo e l’annuncio che chiariva esplicitamente che si trattava di un prodotto rigenerato, non me ne sarei mai accorta, perché sembra davvero nuovo, chi lo ha ripulito ha fatto un lavoro perfetto, è in condizioni ottime, non gli avrei dato un grado A, ma A++, consigliatissimo!\n']"
