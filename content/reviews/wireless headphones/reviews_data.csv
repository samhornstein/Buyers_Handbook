This is very good because any lose in-ear buds will lose not only volume, but the bass quality of a song.• Very plain looking. No branding as they look like just any regular earbuds. Big fan of this because; One, less likely to get stolen, and two, they’re discrete looking. I’m not a fan of being a walking billboard on tech that I already paid money for. This is why I respect that Amazon isn’t following that system with these buds (except for the case, but nobody is perfect).• If you’re indoors, these little guys are just the same as if you have an Amazon Echo in your ear. You don’t need to press anything but just say “Alexa,” and Alexa will be ready to go.• It didn’t take long for me to go get used to the touch controllers. Amazon also went a step further to allow you to customize the function of them. (I just stuck to what was already programmed because the layout they provided is very easy to master.)• No issues when I got sweaty while I was running with them. As Amazon requests, you need to clean them after you take them off. I just used my shirt and it was fine, nothing fancy.• The earbuds know when you take them out of your ear and will pause your music the moment it leaves your ear. I try to trick this feature, but the earbuds weren’t fooled. You can restart your music either asking Alexa or just tap the earbud.• The sound is good but not Air Pods or Bose level. The sound isn’t bloated, has decent bass, and overall has decent balance tones. The best music for this is in the middle that doesn’t rely on a strong bass or deeper sound levels (will explain more later on).• I did hear a decent amount of reduction of sound thanks to Amazon's/Bose's noise-reduction software. Note, this isn't a noise-canceling but it blocks out smaller sounds like the humming sound when your refrigerator turns on, or the sound of cars going by if you’re inside. These types of small sounds are blocked by this software and it does a decent job.• You can use one earbud independently. I found this feature the best when you’re driving. Taking phone calls and even asking directions by using Alexa is definitely a useful tool to use when driving.• If you have an Amazon Echo at home, these earbuds will allow you to make an audio call right to the Echo. Tested this out and it works fine. The response and the receiving end didn’t have any issues. I believe you can also do this feature with any of your friends who have an Echo, but I have to assume they’re some restrictors so you don’t call them in the middle of the night.• With three built-in microphones in each earbud, I felt the call quality to be excellent.• Amazon has added a “sidetone” feature which allows you to hear your voice inside the earbuds. I believe with this you can modulate your voice so Alexa can be able to recognize your voice better when you’re in a loud environment. It’s an interesting tool to have, but you need the app for this.• A built-in quick charge feature on the case will allow the battery to gain a 50% increase in battery life around 20 minutes. What I like about the battery layout specifically is it will show you when you have a lot (green light), an all right (yellow light), or a poor battery life (red light). You can also just check the app, or ask Alexa, but this way is quicker to know right away.• The wingtips that come with these earbuds are useful if you want to feel a little more comfortable that your buds won’t fall out. Even with the soft silicone cover, I honestly didn’t feel the need to wear them as the earbuds stick pretty well in your ear (or at least in my ear). This will probably be different for you, given different ear sizes.• Amazon makes the earbuds visually identifiable for which ear it goes in to. A small feature but very useful in any day to day lifestyle.• The case is small enough to put it in your pocket, with your phone.• You can still use Siri if you want as well as Apple Music and Spotify.• I have an iPhone and so far there have been no disconnections between the earbuds and the phone.Cons and Oks:__________• Micro USB instead of USB-C for charging. Amazon is not letting this go and I have no idea why.• I had no issue with my fit, but they're pretty bulky for earbud size. Depending on your ear size, some may find the fit uncomfortable. My advice is to read what others have to say to get an accurate level. As stated they fit me fine, but I will update you if it changes.• Alexa will not work in loud environments. Just walking on the streets, with average traffic noises, Alexa wasn’t able to hear my voice. I had to put a lot of effort into getting Alexa to work when facing the outside world. Inside is fine but for loud areas, be warned.• No volume controls on the buds. You have to either ask Alexa or use the app. If you’re in a loud environment Alexa will not be helpful, as they basically become wired headphones (without the wire).• As I mention before, these are not “noise-canceling” but just reduces the noises around you. From my experience, this feature will not help you when you’re on a plane. It’s still an upgrade from not having anything, but it will not block all medium/loud sounds.• No wireless charging for the case. You’re stuck with Micro USB.• Without connected to your phone, and no Wi-Fi, Alexa will not work. I wish they created an offline Alexa so simple tasks such as increasing the volume can be performed. You can’t use any features without Wi-Fi.• I notice the case scratches the same day I got it. In your pocket with your keys, this case will show the scratches.• Battery life isn’t great. Around 4.30 hours of use before charging them back in the case. It’s cool that there is a quick charge on the case, but if you forget to charge the case then you’re pretty limited with time. This battery life isn’t horrible, but it sure isn’t great enough to be a pro.• Remember, as with any Alexa, Amazon may potentially review your Alexa voice recording. This is why Alexa needs to be connected online to be used. All interactions go to the cloud because, like the Echo, Alexa is always listening. You can manually delete your Alexa interactions, but that itself is going to be time-consuming, and most of us will forget to keep doing that.• If you disable Alexa then you’re restricted to just basic Bluetooth headphones.• When you adjust the volume, with having the noise reduction active, the music changes in the tune. It only happens for a couple of seconds, but I notice it enough to make a note and see if anyone else has the same issue. Note, it does go away quickly.• It took me a couple of tries to connect it with my iPhone. I had to manually pair them first on the iPhone before using the Alexa app.• You can customize the action touch layout of the earbuds, but you’re very limited in customization.• You also need to install the Alexa app if you want to use these earbuds fully. Amazon is pretty strict about the environment you need to be in.• I’m not a fan of the volume. At a low volume level, the quality of any sound becomes muddy while at high levels weren’t impressive at all. They’re still respected headphones, but I wish the volume levels performed better in the hardware.• Make sure you place the earbuds properly in the case. A couple of times the charging contacts didn’t sit properly against the case.• The phone calls are very clear with your voice but I could still hear background noises when I gave the earbuds to a friend. He was in a room with a football game on TV, at a reasonable volume level.• Around 5-6 mandatory agreements, you need to agree to if you want to use Alexa or configure with Amazon’s Alexa’s app.Bottom Line:__________Amazon always tries to find the middle ground in the quality of a product and the price you’re paying. To summarize, these earbuds fit without any wobble, all of Alexa is right in your ear, the noise reduction software does its job well, and it has a great microphone setup. I respect that there are no logos on the buds themselves and to be able to have a case to keep your earbuds charged on the go is right on point.But to compete with Apple or Samsung, sadly I don’t think so. You have to allow Alexa to be on all the time, which reduces an already weak battery system. And if you disable Alexa then most features are limited, such as not being able to increase/decrease the volume (you will have to go on your phone)/ Also, I’m not a fan of the battery life and of course Micro USB (Amazon, please kill this) is still there, which means no wireless charging.To be honest I felt these earbuds could be worth a little less than what they're asking. Still good earbuds, but I felt the sound isn’t anything to brag about. If you don’t want to afford the pricing of Apple, Google, or Bose earbuds, and you hate the reviews of Samsung earbuds, then this is worth it. I will say the best part of Amazon is they always have sale discounts so if these hit the $99 range you better pick them up. Just be aware you must enjoy the earbuds with the use of Alexa. If you don’t want that, then these are not worth the price.Overall: Not the best in overall quality but the best in establishing Amazon’s Echo in earbud form.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer\n"", '\n  I\'m a tech early adopter. I\'m used to things being a little janky but functional. That describes the original v1 Kindle, but I always felt like the product was working. Like I was getting the intended experience from it. These things are not ready for wide release. Every time I interact with them, they\'re misbehaving in a different way. Why does the case light only blink red, no matter the charge? Why does one bud or the other (it\'s random!) lose charge more quickly during each use? Why is it that sometimes I have to remove the buds from my phone\'s Alexa app, then go through re-pairing? Why don\'t double taps work more than half the time? Why is ""press and hold"" sometimes instant and sometimes takes up to three seconds? Why do I sometimes hear the whispers of long dead relatives come from the ear buds? Mom? Is that you? AND WHY do these echo buds start to feel heavy the longer you wear them? How does that work? I don\'t know! It\'s a mystery!\n', ""\n  I was so excited to get these. Alexa in my ears? Sounds convenient! These could not be more disappointing. Amazon should have spent a considerable amount of time polishing out the bugs in these ear buds before releasing them. The number of issues I have with them is just unreasonable. They don't charge evenly in the case. Left bud will be at 18%, right at 99%. Obviously poor charger connections in the case. The sound is PATHETIC. These things are so quiet it's a joke. I have $20 Bluetooth headphones that make these sound like tin cans. I can hold a regular conversation at max volume while using these buds and that is unacceptable considering they're supposed to be noise canceling. Ha. The only way to control volume on these is by turning up your phone media volume and/or asking Alexa to turn the volume up. No volume controls in the Alexa app like they have for other sound devices. And the noise canceling?? Doesn't work at all. Passthrough? Basically just amplifies all outside noise so you feel like you're wearing hearing aids instead of headphones. The buds do not fit properly. They do not offer large enough tips. Period. I'm a 5 ft tall petite female and these things fall right out of my head with largest tips and wings in. Within 20 minutes of having them in my ears hurt so much I can't even keep them in my ears anymore. Pretty sure the smaller tips are made for children. The touch gestures are idiotic. You try to grab the bud falling out of your ear and it thinks you're using the touch gestures, but when you're actually trying to use the touch gestures the buds ignore your touch. Like they're laughing in your face. Can't share a bud with someone... If each person has a bud it won't play music in one bud even if you're standing right next to each other. Multiple times they have just flat out stopped playing a song right in the middle of it for no reason. One of the most annoying problems??? These buds do not function in tandem with any other Amazon devices which is beyond asinine. Please do yourself a favor and do not waste money on these pieces of trash. I have nothing positive to say about them at all. I'm returning these overpriced pieces of junk.\n"", '\n  In theory these should be great, but they are not.As Earbuds go they sound pretty good and are pretty comfortable, but the way they work is not good.  The issues I keep having are:1.  They say connected to BT but will not work, or the audio side does not connect.2.  The BT connection keeps dropping audio which is very annoying and beats the point of having these.3.  The Buttons (touch) are most often un responsive, or select the wrong thing.4.  When you ask for Alexa, you have to pause until she responds before you can tell her what to do.5.  The graphic equalizer does not respond to what it should. (I wanted to have less bass, but it did not change.)6.  They also make a static like click when they engage sound for some reason.This reminds me of getting the Echo Auto.  Nice idea, but at first was rushed out to people before all the bugs were ironed out.\n']"

These are absolutely phenomenal headphones. I bought them about a year and a half ago and I use them all the time. I had a pair of on ear headphones from a no-name brand a few years ago and, while they served their purpose, they were not impressively loud and became a little aggravating on the ears after a while. These sit very comfortably on my head while I do chores around the house or yard work etc. I run a mobile auto detailing business in my spare time and use them for that as well.  I don’t have a particularly large head and they fit nicely, but I imagine they would be better for someone with a big noggin. If I find myself looking down for too long they will start to slip off my head. I wouldn’t even attempt to do any kind of cardio with these. Weightlifting, sure but running - no. They are too loose and when using the noise canceling feature, any excess movement makes it crackle.The noise canceling is pretty decent. It’s not Bose quality but it’s plenty powerful to muffle a mower, vacuum or grinder. It almost entirely mutes plane noise. Like I mentioned, it doesn’t take much jostling to make it crackle, but if it becomes too annoying I just turn the NC off.Sound quality is also pretty good. Depending on the app/song I’m listening to, it can get EXTREMELY loud.  So much so that I have to turn it down - which is saying something because I listen to my music on full blast most of the time. Sound quality is marginally better with the NC on, but marginally louder with NC off.Build construction is solid enough. Kind of feels like a few steps up from just cheap plastic. Don’t get me wrong - it IS cheap plastic but it presents itself well. Pads are very soft and so far the body has been durable. I’ve dropped these on the ground a few times and, while they are covered in scratches, they are still performing fabulously.Finally, and very importantly, the battery life on these is UNPRECEDENTED. I mean I will use these for hours a day for like 2 weeks in a row before even thinking about charging them. I think they advertise 16 hours, but no joke I have probably used these for 40+ hours between charges and they still weren’t dead. Unbelievable. There is also a widget for the iPhone but I’ve found it to be entirely inaccurate.Bluetooth connection is lightning fast and has superb distance. In an open field I’ve used them further than 80’ from my phone.Gripes: I have only a few.My biggest gripe is the piss poor Siri support. There is not a designated Siri button which sucks. And it wouldn’t be so bad, but there is about a 4 second delay between Siri activation and the prompt to begin speaking. I hope they addressed this with the E8’s.There is an LED on the command switch that never turns off and is quite bright. Also not a huge deal, but it bothers my wife if I try to wear them in bed.Lastly, the hinges of the earpieces have become a little squeaky and loose after a year. Overall, these are minute gripes that I actually had to think about to put in here.Overall these are a fantastic set of headphones and have earned their 5-stars from me. I bought another product from Cowin and had to get in touch with their customer support and was very pleased. I will buy from Cowin in the futureUpdate: 10-11-18I am still using these headphones and continue to be blown away by their deceptively good quality. I mean these suckers refuse to die. I’ve added a few photos this time to show how much abuse they’ve taken over the past few years. The leather is gnarled over the headpiece. There are scratches everywhere. I’ve even dropped this pair off my roof by accident. They didn’t care. They laughed and kept playing the ‘Man of Steel’ film score. Not even joking - that really happened. The battery life remains miraculous. Still getting 30+ hours of play time on full volume. That is an absolute feat considering the common life of Li-Ion batteries. The buttons still work. The Noise Cancelling still works. And despite their twisted appearance, they remain unconventionally comfortable. In my previous post I mentioned that they had started to squeak around the hinges. Yeah that just stopped. I am seriously astounded by these headphones and wonder if I’ll ever even need to upgrade to the E8’s. In any case - Cowin has still got my vote when it comes down to a reasonably priced headphone of extraordinary longevity.Update: 12-17-19My (probably) final thoughts:These headphones have transcended my expectations in quality - So much so that I’ve anthropomorphized them.  Yup they’re basically my buddy. I have been using these every day for 3 YEARS and have not had one single issue with them. Sure the skin is falling off.. And... uh... yeah nope that’s it. That’s literally the only problem plaguing these headphones. I was broke when I bought these (still broke but that’s not relevant) and they have gone above and beyond their purpose for how much I paid for them.  The battery STILL lasts days, the sound quality has not diminished at all, and I am still beating the snot out of these things. I was expecting these to last MAYBE 18 months before I had to search for something else. 3 years later, I’m now looking into a pair of AirPods to replace my dailies, but I’ll be keeping these as backups and for studio work - probably forever. I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon (remember that thing about being broke?) but I hold these headphones with the utmost respect as possibly the best purchase I’ve ever made on this site.Cowin - you guys are doing something right. You’ve made a lifelong customer and I can’t recommend your products enough. Well done.Now go buy these headphones!Update: 05-31-20Un...Be...Lievable.In the time since my last update, I have acquired a set of AirPod Pros. In that same amount of time, they have died. 3 whole months of daily use and they decided not to work anymore. They were 250$. 3 months. I mentioned in my last update that I’d be keeping my E7’s as a set of backups and, well, it has come to be. And THEY STILL WORK LIKE THE DAY I BOUGHT THEM. ARE YOU KIDDING ME COWIN!? The ear pieces have worn off, exposing cloth underneath the leather. This does cause them to hold moisture a lot from sweating (and uh.. smell too..) but that’s the only development in the problems department. I have never had a consumer electronic blow me away the way these headphones have. I LOVE them. Unfortunately I’m out 250 bucks on my AirPods but I learned my lesson. I’ll be ordering a new set of headphones soon, and you bet your butt I’ll be ordering some Cowins.\n', ""\n  \xa0I want to give special attention and rating to COWIN's AMAZING customer service.I never imagined they could be so kind and understanding and after contacting them I just had to go back and write this thankful review.I'm using the headphones for music, TV, PlayStation and they work great. The noise canceling feature does a nice job for that matter as well.\n"", '\n  I am not a professional of any sort, just a 69 year old guy who wears hearing aides who wanted a good and comfortable pair of wireless headphones to use with my laptop while watching Netflix and YouTube. Bought two pair, the other one for my wife.The Cowin E-7 is a beautifully crafted, very comfortable, noise cancelling headphone and the sound quality everything I had hoped for. It paired up quickly with my HP Laptop on the first attempt without any hesitation. The fit and finish is near perfect in my opinion. The attractive brushed aluminum frame is very attractive, well padded and oh so smooth to the touch. It came with a nice leather like travel bag, a cord for direct connection to a cell phone, laptop or other similar device and a USB cable for charging the lithium battery. After performing a good long over night first-time battery charge, I used them for six continuous hours glorious comfortable hours. There was no fading of sound and the battery seemed to be ready for several more hours of use. The volume control is smooth and adjusts easily. The sound remained clear, crisp and easy to listen to from the highest to the lowest volume setting.Comparable headphones at Walmart are mych more expensive and their cheaper ones are...well, cheap for a reason. Been there, done that. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, high quality, noise cancelling wireless headphone and I would buy them again in a nano second.\n', ""\n  This product is on par with big brand names (and I have used several of them including Bose and Dr. Beats for over 6 months). It works just fine with cellphones and tablets. When turned on, it automatically connects to my cellphone every time after the initial set up. Voice quality for phone conversations is good; people at the other end could easily hear me. Wired connection is good as well.When one side of the heaphone did not work, I contacted the seller. They promptly responded back and took care of the issue, which I'm very happy about. I would highly recommend this product and the seller.\n"", ""\n  Nicely packed. They are light have great sound. I noticed if you have the noise cancelling on and you barely bump them they make a crackling sound also the music sounds more like it's in a hall. With noise cancelling off they sound excellent crisp sound great bass the works. They are great headphones. UPDATE: THESE HEADPHONES ARE STILL AWESOME.MUSIC SOUNDS BETTER ON BLUTOOTH AND NOT WITH THE NOISE CANCELLING ON. YOU CAN SAVE $10.00 BY BUYING THE VERSION WITHOUT NOISE CANCELLING. THEY REALLY DON'T CANCEL OUT NOISE BUT WITH THE MUSIC PLAYING YOU DON'T HEAR OUTSIDE NOISE AND THE MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE YOUR THERE OR EVEN BETTER. GREAT QUALITY AND WORKMANSHIP. VERY WELL BUILT\n"", ""\n  The quality astounded me with the pair that I received. Long ago I was a sound technician and am picky with the quality of headphones. These did not disappoint and compare with the pro models, yet at a novice price. The ear pieces tilt left to right, thus they don't pinch or squeeze and are comfortable for long periods of time. These are truly noise cancelling (unlike other pairs I have that claimed to do so). When you put them on and close your eyes, and turn on the tunes, the world disappears.\n"", '\n  A fantastic  noise cancellation headphone!This one is my favourite headphone of all time.\u200bExcellent build quality. Great sound quality. Terrific looking!There is not a single thing bad I can say about this one.I find them to be worth every cent.Would buy again.\n', ""\n  I love my music and listen to a lot of classical music. But, I am not an audiophile with out of this world hearing capabilities. Also, I have never used a high-end and much more expensive ANC headphone (reason is that most of them are not bluetooth which is what I need). But, I truly think that if you are an average person like me, spending 2-10 times as much for an small amount of quality (which is probaby unnoticeable to the average Joe) doesn't make sense.Here is my experience with my Cowin E7 Noise Cancelling Bluetooth headphone. Initially I bought one to pair along with a Bluetooth TX/RX  which I also bought on amazon to watch TV late at night. It worked really well. Battery life is very good at ~30 hours. Headphones are comfortable and I was also able to walk around the house without loosing Bluetooth connection.I happily used the headphone for about 30-50 hours then I gave it to my cousin who was annoyed with his old headphones.Today, bought a second pair for myself and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is looking for a well performing ANC headphones.\n"", ""\n  I have never owned a pair of noise-cancelling headphones but these were reasonably priced and they are honestly quite great! The noise cancelling feature works wonders on buses, planes basically any commute. Especially on plane rides, I often use the noise cancelling feature to get me right to sleep and now often sleep through entire ~4hour plane trips! One of the best purchases I've made in a while. The battery life is amazing and also it's replaceable! which I really like because it shows the manufacturer is creating for a long lasting product and not trying to fleece you into buying another pair when the battery life starts to lessen.\n"", ""\n  Awesome battery life - I go by several days without charging it.Noise cancelling option works great. I turn it on along with some music and outside noises are cancelled out.Sound quality is good but not perfect. Lots of bass so I enjoy it very much with chill-heavy-bass beats.Overall quality is OK. Looks high-end but is definitely made of average quality materials. However, this does not compromise comfort - still feels great when wearing them.Only con:Don't count on the microphone. I simply do not use it -receivers cannot hear me clearly.\n""]"

I am a professional musician by trade and these have incredibly clear sound quality, really high end parts put into this product.The connection is fast and easy, it charges while in the case which is a great feature but better than all these features I love the ability to wear them in the shower and jam to tunes while they get soaked and survive it like a champ. Really high end headphones for a amazingly good price. I would recommend these to anyone looking for Bluetooth headsets similar to those made by Apple but for a far less price and also BETTER bass response!!The touch controls on the side are fantastically good if you wanted to pause music or youtube at work when someone asks you a question so you can hear them without taking the headset out. They are incredibly good at isolating and even at the lowest volume they can shut out the world around you. I wear them everywhere and love them so much.They come with a charge case, 3 extra sets of ear tips to fit whatever size ear you have, a charge cable for charging the case (micro usb) and a one year warrantee!Do yourself a favor and get a set of these superb Bluetooth earbuds!Did I mention they are waterproof?! IPX8 Waterproof!!\n', ""\n  This is the second time I reviewed this company's products. I'm sort of a earbud Junkie, and make a lot of purchases. About six months ago I purchased the older version of these headphones, and fell in love. I was looking on Amazon to see what other products this company had, and if there was any new versions. I was pleasantly surprised to see be upgraded version of headphones so I found a reason to order the newest set by giving my children my old set. I work in construction and listen to audio books all day long keep from going crazy , my job is incredibly boring. Because my job keeps me from home for such a longperiod. I only use one earbud at a time. I insert the first one around 3 a.m. and begin my stories, I swap it out around lunch and the second one last me until 4:30 in the afternoon when I get home. In the past with other brands I've had I'd have to swap out my earbuds about every 2 hours, not with these. The newest version that I'm reviewing is even better than the last, both in battery power, insound, an ability to connect to my phone. One problem that I've noticed I've had in the past with the charging boxes is that the magnets are almost never strong enough to keep the earbud from falling off while charging, this newest version has an incredibly strong making. It doesn't help that I have fat fingers then make it difficult for me to grasp small things. Hahaha, they did a great job we're including super strong magnets they will ensure that these earbuds keep charging for the next use. I threw my phone in one of my back pockets of my pants and this new version ensures you don't lose connection no matter which way you turn your head. They're incredibly loud and clear so that when you're in a noisy environment you can still hear what you're listening to. It took me a moment to get use to the fact that the buttons are touch activated rather than traditional buttons, but I quickly became acustomed to brushing the face of the earphone. Its nice as now when I set them in my ear I dont knock them out when trying to pause my audiobooks when people are trying to talk to me. In my last review of this company's products I said they have a customer for life, and I gladly say it again.\n"", '\n  Update: After about a year of use, we ran into some trouble with these headphones. They are constantly disconnecting from bluetooth and one of the earbuds is super quiet. I messaged Tozo to inquire about the warranty, and they are sending a full replacement. Two thumbs up for their customer service!I have a young teenage son who wanted a pair of AirPods, as he was sick of headphones with wires. I was unwilling to get him something so expensive, so we compromised with these, as it won’t be as big of a deal if he loses them!I already own and love a pair of Tozo T-10s, but he wanted a pair with a much smaller case that will fit in his pocket at school. These fit the bill! They’re about 1/4 inch wider and just slightly taller than airpods. He’s super happy with the size.The lid is magnetic and closes with an audible clack just like AirPods. Apparently my teen thinks this is important, ha ha.Charging via a charging pad works great. My son really likes the four bright lights that tell him how much charge is left. He says he’s used them all week and hasn’t had to recharge his case yet.The sound seems good. My son has no complaints whatsoever. I borrowed them for a few hours to listen to podcasts, and the sound was good for that.One thing that I wish was like the T-10 is that it does not appear that you can pair one earbud to one device, and the other earbud to another device.  My phone just recognizes these as Tozo-T6. The T-10s show as Tozo-T10-R (or L), which allows me to pair them as two separate devices. I wish this had that. But my son could care less, as he doesn’t own more than one device. :)Overall, my son loves these and is totally happy to have these and not AirPods. The model number suggests that maybe it’s a lower mode number than the T-10, but I think these actually might be a newer, upgraded version.\n', '\n  \xa0I have been using this earbuds for sometime now and these are perfect!. I was able to use this for long hours without getting ear pain. Sound quality is absolutely amazing and its very easy to carry in your pocket while traveling. I highly recommend this product.\n', ""\n  Let’s face it, if anyone is looking to buy a pair of in ear wireless headphones then opting for the Apple AirPods is where almost all of us would start looking. But with so many other options now on the market is there something that is able to do the job (or even a better job) for a fraction of the cost....we’ll, yes there is!The Tozo T6 headphones are a great option for anyone looking for their first delve into wireless headphone territory.Firstly the form factor is great, they don’t have the annoying stick down the side of the ear unlike Apple AirPods, these are confined to your actual ear, if you wear a scarf it means you won’t dislodge these, and with a true in ear seal, which is made even better with so many ear cup options they fit very snugly without being tight or uncomfortable. the case also mirrors the Apple style with magnets to hold them into place with a handy charge light on the case, the nicely clicking opening hinge further gives joy when opening the up, one minor gripe is that they can be a bit fiddly to get out, but I’ve always managed.Functionality of these is also excellent, you can play, pause, skip, rewind, even turn volume up and down with only the touch to the headphones (something which is way ahead of the apple ones) They even speak back to you what option you’ve selected which is very helpful so you know if it’s understood what you've asked for.Sound quality is excellent for a pair of wireless headphones, especially at the price point. The fact that they seal completely in your ear gives great passive noise cancellation, and although when playing some songs they can be a little soft in the mid and lacking in base, just tweaking Spotify’s EQ to bass boost gives a lovely rich warm sound which is excellent.I can’t comment on battery life as yet, but other users seem impressed, and Tozo Claim 5 hours of music playback, which is far longer than my 1 hour commute so it’s fine for my (and probably most peoples) needs.As seen on the photo they come with micro USB charging case and instructions, but are very easy to set up and pair straight from the box.In summary these are an excellent pair of headphones from a sound, comfort, form factor and the all important, price point. Would definitely recommend them.(And for those wondering, yes I do own a pair of Apple AirPods too...)\n"", '\n  Really nice product. I couldnt justify spending £150+ on apple airpods when these looked so appealing especially the price! The reviews on amazon were all very positive so i thought i would give them a try. I havnt been left disappointed... this product in my eyes is just as good as any other on the market. They fit perfectly and come with alternative ear sizing pieces where you can change them to whatever suits your ear for comfort. Really happy... going to buy another pair for my partner.\n', '\n  I\'ve used wireless earbuds for a while, and I\'m generally a fan of my B&O E8 2.0s. However, I have been shopping around for a while for new earbuds to use as a backup for a few reasons:- The leather case on the B&Os feels premium, but it\'s not exactly practical for the gym- Connectivity on the B&O is not perfect when on the move, especially when your phone is close to your bodyBeing broadly satisfied with TOZO products (love their screen protectors for my Samsung Note 9), I decided to give these wireless earbuds a chance. They came promptly. The box has a real premium feel, and the earbuds are nicely packed inside, with the standard plastic protection you would expect from a premium product. Algotether, the presentation feels more Apple-y than I was expecting (which is a really good thing!).Taking the wrapper off of the case, it\'s very similar in size, shape & design to the Airpod case (which was the obvious inspiration). I was a little disappointed -- but not surprised -- to see a Micro-USB port on the bottom instead of a USB-C port; however, wireless charging works as advertised. The case shape is also nice because it\'s not as thick as the ""losenge"" case of the E8s -- it\'s much easier to slip into a pocket.When you take the buds out of the case for the first time, they immediately drop into pairing mode, and I was paired and running in less than 30 seconds. My phone reports they prefer to stream in AAC, which is kind of what you would expect for buds in this price range.In terms of signal strength and stability of connection, these blow the B&Os completely out of the water. With the B&Os, if I had my phone in the back left pocket, the signal would drop the moment I moved to a noisy environment. With the TOZO pair, the connection stays solid and reliable.In terms of audio quality, I\'m no audiophile but the TOZOs are clearly more bass-heavy than my E8s -- this actually makes them nicer for pop and mainstream music in certain scenarios. I\'ve also taken a few calls on these and my voice has come through without much issue (which is actually an improvement on the E8s, which aren\'t known for their microphone quality).All told, these are good ""starter"" earbuds, and also a good companion for someone who may have a much pricier set which they don\'t want to take to the gym / in the rain. They are excellent value for the price.\n', ""\n  I have been searching for ages for some Bluetooth earphones which are waterproof/sweatproof, have good sound quality and are similar to Airpods in design without the Apple price. Well look no further, these tick all the boxes!They look great and much more expensive than they are. The charging case is perfect and works well to keep them charged up and has LED lights on the front to indicate how much charge it has left. In terms of the headphone design, I was worried that they would fall out all the time, especially as I wanted to use them for running, but with all the different size ear pieces, I found a perfect fit and so far they haven't budged. It takes a little bit of getting used to if you haven't used similar in-ear headphones before but they fit well and are comfortable to wear for a prolonged amount of time. Just make sure to place them in and twist them for a secure fit. The sound is of a really good quality with a good bass and is good at cancelling background noise. The touch function to change and pause songs works smoothly and is simple, with just a slight delay from command to it doing what you've asked. Pairing the device was so simple and once you've paired once it will remember your device. You can turn on/off both earpieces individually so make sure you have turned both on to get the sound in both - you can also used just one ear piece if you would like.These are a really great product, especially for the price! Just be aware they do not come with a charger so I have been on the hunt for a micro-USB cable and will eventually buy their wireless charging pad - another pro of them is that they support wireless charging. Another positive is how quick the delivery was - ordered them Sunday evening and received them by lunchtime Monday.\n"", '\n  -I wanted a bit of time to test these out properly before reviewing so a few weeks later here goes:-Fast delivery and in good quality packaging (not excessive)-I purchased the white headphones, they look and feel great quality for the cost and the colour seems slightly pearlised which I love!-Worked straight out of the box and has an 18month warranty sticker included to register-Sound quality is great - I like quite bass heavy music (RnB, Dancehall, House) as well as classical and some rock so I tested a wide variety of music genres and also films and I am impressed with the quality in comparison to bigger brands used, the bass is just right and all sounds seem crisp and clear and the volume is more than sufficient unless you really want to wreck your eardrums!-Love the wireless charging feature and it’s so fast too, the headphones held a good 4+hrs continuous charge on highest volume for me which I think is excellent-Headphones feel really stable in your ears (several buds to chose from so should fit majority of people well)-Very touch responsive and really easy to operate-Tested falls on them too and whilst I don’t really use them for this often it worked well enough and was clear for me and the other caller-I was able to move around the entire house and into the garden and not lose any sound quality-These are excellent true wireless headphones for the price and I have and would definitely recommend them!\n']"

Turned it on and connected it, the sound is wonderful, was expecting the ever great quality as I usually receive from vea tools and I am not disappointed. The bass and the voice coming through this headset is crystal clear. Besides having great sound quality the earphone is very comfortable to wear and also light. Easy slip on and fits comfortable in the ear. I would recommend this headset to anyone who needs a pair of sports headset to buy. The battery life is great and they are comfortable. I love it, will be buying more soon.\n', ""\n  \xa0This product is great, you can listen to your songs with the best sound you have imagined, they fit perfectly in your ears, they are very comfortable, you can workout with them and they will never fall off, the battery lasts for a long time... They are easy to use and one of the best things is that when you are on a call, it is not only one side that you can hear on, but you can always hear it on both sides, that's great. I have tried other earbuds and they do not work the same way these work these are the best I have tried. Something that I loved and found to be very functional about this product is that it charges very fast, you just put it to charge and in an hour or a little less than that you can have 100% charge in the battery and they will last you about 8 or 12 hours depends on how much you use it. I definitely recommend this product as I repeat they are the best I have tried I really like the color the comfortable ones that are the sound everything is perfect in these earbuds... blessings!\n"", ""\n  I've bought a couple of earbuds from this company that I've enjoyed, but these are my favorite so far. I usually use them on my walk to work or during conference calls and the audio quality is great when connected to my phone (Samsung Galaxy) or computer. They fit really well and I don't have to worry about them falling out (they include other soft ear bud covers in case you need a different size for your ears). I'm impressed at how good the sound is for the price; while music is not the primary way I am using these, they work decently enough for that purpose. My favorite part is the charging case with battery indicator. It makes a big difference to ensure the battery level on each earpiece is enough and the number indicated for the overall case battery level. Just make sure to charge fully and ensure they are in pairing mode when using with a new device- it took me a few times to get it right, but now I have no issues. Also, the case charges with a standard USB-C cord (same as my phone) so it is convenient in that way was well. Excellent price and quality, highly recommended!\n"", ""\n  \xa0This headset is awesome!! It fits snugly on your ear. You don’t have to worry about it slipping or falling out of your ear. Depending on which rubber piece you select, it forms the section isolating outside noise. There are volume buttons on each ear which allows you to turn it up or down. The sound is great too with surprisingly solid bass. Music plays at a good volume. It charges quickly and it lasts a long time once it's fully charged.\n"", ""\n  \xa0I bought this product because I wanted something comfortable to work out in that would fall off easily. I am very satisfied with the results, especially for the price. They haven't fallen off once and they do not hurt my sensitive ears. Initially I didn't care if the battery was good or not, but after having it and barely ever having to charge it I really enjoy having a long lasting battery. The case is also nice and feels expensive, the battery indicator are nice haves as well.\n"", '\n  \xa0I am very pleased with the Veatool True Wireless Earbuds. You never know what to expect with earbuds that don’t cost a lot of money, but I was blown away at how good these earbuds were for how little they cost. The charging case is about the size of a bar of soap and fits comfortably in my hand. The earbuds fit very comfortably around your ear with their unique over the ear design. There are three different sizes of silicone covers that allow for a very comfortable fit in your ear.Pairing to my Google Pixel phone was a very easy process and took no time at all. The sound quality was amazing. I usually need for my music to be quite loud to really enjoy it, but even on the lower volumes the earbuds did a great job. These are probably some of the more comfortable earbuds that I have tried and am looking forward to being able to use these while I workout.\n', ""\n  \xa0These True Wireless Earbuds are good for the price. They come with a charging case which takes 2 hours to charge and the earbuds themselves take 1-1.5 hours to charge. With that, they can be used for up to 8 hours either talking or playing music, and 100 hours or more of standby time. The fit in the ears is not too bad either.A note about the charging case: the charging case is really smooth and it has a rounded shape, so it will not catch onto your pocket or bag like other cases made of webbing. I like how it feels, and it fits nice in my hand.So the earbuds themselves are a little narrow, however they still seemed to fit good and it seems like they would adjust to most peoples' ear. The sound quality is on par too, not too bad for the price and good enough to suit most people's needs. I like listening to podcasts and talking on the phone, so for my needs, they are good.The connectivity range is 10m, which is about standard. Not too bad for the price.Overall, this is a good buy if you are looking for decent earbuds.\n""]"

The battery life is heads and shoulders above my old airpods, and I love the fact you can easily monitor the battery life of both the case and the earbuds themselves.I'd highly recommend, with the one caveat that the sound definitely isn't 'bass-y', so if you like a super deep sound to your earbuds, these probably won't fit the bill, but are otherwise fantastic for the price!\n"", '\n  I am personally writing a review because of the battery life.

I figured after four years there has to be some serious improvements in noise cancelling technology, and since the WH-1000XM3 model got so many good reviews I figured these would be awesome. So I pre-ordered them.I pulled them out of the box and followed the very quick connect process of downloading the app and using it to pair to my phone. It downloaded a firmware update automatically while I fiddled around with some settings briefly and listened to some music. Super easy, awesome.The sound is very impressive. Punchy kick drum (I listen mostly to rock/metal) and nice bright sound. I quickly settled on a slightly customized version of the included Bright preset.But things quickly went downhill from there.After using the headphones for a bit, the touch controls became frankly annoying and easily susceptible to mistakes (I triggered track skips multiple times just by removing and putting the headphones back on). The volume adjustment is especially tedious...if you want to raise or lower the volume significantly you have to swipe it up or down a large number of times because the volume adjustment is done in small increments. With the Bose QC 35 and its dedicated buttons, you just quickly push the buttons. Simple.I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to pair the headphones with my laptop, reading the guide in the app and doing some web searching, thinking it must be provided by one of the two dedicated buttons like on the Bose QE 35s. Nope. It must be done with the app. In fact, everything has to be done with the app except whatever you have the custom button configured to do, and the power. On the Bose I just have to slide the power button, and it goes into pairing mode. Simple.The above are honestly smaller issues that you could probably put up with since the sound these produce is so good. However, the deal breaker for me was when I connected them with the included wire to the controller on my Roku Ultra to enjoy some TV time after a long day. I always watch movies and TV with headphones. To my horror they produced a clearly audible hissing sound that is incredibly distracting. I turned them off and on again, disconnected and reconnected the cable. No change, still the hissing sound. My Bose don't produce this sound. Ugh.After listening to them for a couple hours I had a slight headache and felt fatigued, almost nauseous. I know some people are affected differently by the noise cancelling technology, but I don't get this from my Bose, even after listening to them all day.Additionally, speaking of noise cancelling, I compared my Bose QC 35s to these, and I couldn't tell the difference between the noise cancelling. They sound the same to me. :shrug: I'm sure you could tell the difference with laboratory equipment though.All-in-all the sound these produce is really good, and the noise cancelling is great (although I can't tell the difference from my Bose QC 35 Series I). But they have 1) lots of annoyances in the touch controls instead of dedicated buttons, 2) the fact that the app is required to do everything (including pairing) except turning them off and activating the custom button, 3) the hissing on the wired connection to my Roku Ultra, and 4) the fatiguing after listening to them.I'll be returning them.\n"", '\n  Download Sony Headphone Connect App, open box, turn on headphones (bottom of left headphone on/off switch), using Sony Connect App, connect and paired new headphones.- My headphones were 100% charged out of box.- Many features in Sony Connect App, matter of your preference and use. I do think the app is solid and useful for my use of these headphones.- My headphones firmware updated automatically -be patient, process took several minutes. Initial impression; very comfortable, really good noise canceling and sound quality.- Voice clarity on both ends is outstanding.- Easily connected two iPhones,  my experience switching between them was seamless.- Used ear profile in-app feature to analyze my ear shape for 360 Reality Audio setup.- Able to connect to MacBook Pro (2020 version) directly via Bluetooth with no issues.UPDATE:  >30 hours of iPhone X, 8, and Bluetooth MacBook Pro connection.- The phone call quality is awesome (you can hear- No video lag/latency on FT and Zoom calls.-  I have found the connection at times can be a bit cumbersome when having two devices connected and receiving calls, it might be a setting or how I am picking up the call --directly from the phone or double-tapping on the headset.- Great noise suppression to the wind, outside city/road-noise, etc... No reported issues with other people on calls with me. Always told call quality was very crisp and clear...  my experience, much better than Apple Airpod Pro for suppression of noise for callers on the other end.- I have also now used these headphones for Bluetooth connection to Nvidia Shield connected to my TV for over 16 hrs. Easy direct connection directly from Nvidia Bluetooth Settings.  TV and Movie surround sound is great, you can hear the slightest sounds.Bose 700 vs. Sony WH-1000XM4- Seamless connection - prefer SONY- Comfort - prefer Sony- Headphone sound controls - prefer Bose. Sony touch control works ok but the Bose increase/decrease volume seems to work better on Sony- Noise-canceling for me, both performed in a similar way- Call quality, for me, both performed in a similar wayI Will continue to test and use Bose but the feel of the headset on my head is not as comfortable as Sony.UPDATE: Running 7.3 Update- Not sure if related but the initial bluetooth connection and subsequent connections are problematic;- I have had to reconnect several times via the app and my phone needs to be very close to the headset;- Once I am connected it has worked but I have had to repeat the process a few times now;- Additionally, after significant use, the touch controls are a nice feature but not ideal under some circumstances. For example, if you have a hoodie on, jacket with hood, etc... touch control is sensitive and fabric, cord, ect... will effect the touch controls.- I am running iphone X with latest iOS, should be receiving iphone 12 Pro this eve and will update with any new  comments.\n', '\n  Noise cancellation and audio quality exceeded my expectations.

I saw these were coming out and wasn't sure. I did more research and was leaning towards the 700's to save money. I am primarily using these for WFH (music/calls) and the mic on the 700's is said to be amazing. As I researched I googled around and found that Bose has been having weeks of software issues and didn't want to get into that. I almost pre-ordered the M4's but decided to sleep on it because it didn't make a difference being in a queue. Finally one day, I found a YouTube video on the M4 and all my concerns were already addressed. I was sold.Yesterday (Aug 18th) these arrived at my door and I was on calls ALL DAY. They were perfect. Today, I get to enjoy music and silence –– HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n"", '\n  Edit: After almost four month of usage i found that noise cancelling makes me sick. I feel like nausea and feverish for 1-2 to days. Worst thing I’ve developed tinnitus because of these headphones.Older reviewThis is my first Bluetooth headphone, never been fan of Bluetooth because of poor audio quality. When Sony released ldac codec i was really happy and was waiting for xperia but they decided to close their mobile division. After that was waiting for pixel 4 but google’s mobile division has bunch of idiots.Finally bought iPhone which has crappy audio quality but I suggested one of my senior xm3s and to my surprise they sounded really well on iPhone too. After lockdown i was really frustrated with the news channel that my parents watches. Waiting for xm4 can’t be more painful.Now coming to reviewANC: i felt no difference compared to xm3, they block the rumble of fans, coolers and pump set but are unable to block the voice of people talking(irritating voice of arnab goswami). They didn’t even changed xm4’s pressure inside the cans after anc is enabled. I still get the same headaches.Audio quality: not going to write like pretentious audiophile. These headphone are quite versatile if you are bass head then sony has it covered for you (which most of the people like here), bass was way overpowering for me on full setting but i don’t like bass at all. I mostly listen to linkin park, so i set base level at -4 and equaliser on bright preset. This is by far the best audio product i have ever used.Audio quality wise here is my ranking.SM es 18<Creative ep830<SM e10s<Fiio f9 pro<one more triple driver<xm3<xm4.Battery life: I was doing burn in procedure of these headphones, so i kept headphones at max possible volume, so you may get better battery life. I got 18 hr of battery life with anc on. After unboxing battery went down from 100 to 60 in a 10 min and i was afraid that i got faulty unit but thank god a full charge fixed it.Comfort:Ear cups are bigger than xm3s and hence more comfortable too. After walking with them for half an hour on roof my ear got all sweaty.Multipoint connection: Works flawlessly, although switching music from one device to another is bit erratic.Audio lag: I also connected it to airtel xtream box and watched a complete episode of boys with no lag at all.Speak to talk: still prefer the old put you hand on right ear cup.Pause when headphone taken off: work 8 out of 10 times.360 deg reality audio: sony has give 3 months of free subscription of nugs.net but difference was not deal breaker.Accessories: you get 3.5 mm male cable from both sides, thank you sony for that. Charging cable is really short i mean really. You can use the provide cable just with power bank or laptop. You also get airplane adapter and carry bag too.Sorry forgot about micMic: It is better than my iPhone 11 pro, my friend used to complain a lot about low volume from my side but with xm4 they had no problem talking to me.\n', '\n  Update sept 26Got the replacement set and they sound do much better than the first ones I recieved. This kind of issues is unheard of from a product that costs 30k not gonna lie. Seriosuly? A defective pair of headphones ? Unexpected sony !Update- sept-25So I was  using these like.usual when I started hearing a shrill noise from the right side earcup! Tried it with multiple devices , persistsnt shrill noise with noise cancelion and no music( my room\'s fan was off ) . Replacing for a new pair . Will updateI\'m not a ""audiophile"" but I\'ve tested and heard many headphones/earphones in search of the ""perfect"" pair of cans for me. Perfect is a subjective term and will vary from person to person.I bought these becasue of all the hype with the xm3\'s and as a customer the ""next"" version would obviously be better right ?So, come delivery day. I ooened these, set them up, updated the firmware and started listening . These sound , ok. For something that costs 30k, these sound average at best. The noice cancelling is good but I need to test it more , possibly on an airplane ( whenever that happens )When something is this expensive you automatically have some expectations from it right ? It has to perform at the 30k level ( I hope the reader is getting what I\'m trying to say) .The software features are great , the build feels premium, the connection is strong.P.S if you intend to use the multipoint function you will loose audio quality . LDAC uses two lanes ( max for bluetooth 5.0) and when you use multipoint it switches to SBC ( 1 lane ) so expect quality loss. Windows doesn\'t support LDAC so you will loose significant quality when connected to a pc.I\'ll update the review after the burn in period . I won\'t be returning these since these are just too damn comfortable but doesn\'t justify the 30k price tag it demands for the sound quality I\'m getting as of 20 sept.\n', ""\n  Initial 12hrs usage impressions:Super comfortable.I am not an audiophile but these sounds amazing.ANC is great (tested indoors as of now).Dual device connection is also great.Great connection range.Speak to Chat works great but it has some obvious issues (something you need to get used to).Ambient Sound is also nice.Update:ANC cancels out the vehicular traffic sounds as well (horn sounds, movement), a bit dangerous considering you are planning to take a walk/run sideways. You can tweak the ANC settings via the Sony ANC app.Speak to chat can be finicky at times, there is a slight delay of 2secs. Sometimes it just fails to recognise and sometimes it gets triggered without speaking anything.My suggestion to buyers, don't go by the online reviews, it might be a good purchase for me but not for everyone. Try them out at some retail store before buying. I might update this when I have something more to share.\n"", '\n  If you are looking for noise cancelation at its best, don\'t look elsewhere and buy this immediately.Of all the comments that have been said about being not enough this, not able to do that, I think they are all untrue or either an unlucky manufacturing defect. Launch products are not perfect from the start, it\'s bound to happen. The only thing I do not use are the microphones for making calls, so you can check online and see for yourself about that aspect.Let\'s break this down in points. (TLDR at the bottom)Comfort/Ergonomics:Without a doubt the most comfortable headphones I ever wore. People seem to complain that it\'s not as comfortable as the XM3s, I say it\'s pretty dang comfortable considering that I wore this thing for more than 5 hours straight and had no neck pain or itching whatsoever.The weight of these headphones is so light that when the box came in, I thought I had been scammed and the headphones weren\'t in the box. 250 ish grams is really light (0.55 pounds) for headphones.The ears are big enough, the line of the muffs doesn\'t overlap too much towards the neck and the cushion material adapts really well to your head, both on the top of the frame and on the ear muffs.Sound/frequency response:I have been mixing/mastering for multiple years on flat studio monitors. Out of all the headphones that I have or I have tried, these are the closest of being pretty much flat, once you cut 3-4 dB from the 400 Hz fader (pretty sure it\'s an octave bandwidth, or a little more, so it covers at least from 282 Hz to 566 Hz when you adjust it) on the equalizer in Sony\'s Headphones app.I have attached the frequency response curve as an image in this review.The bass is not overwhelming, (although if it\'s your style, it delivers with the clear bass knob, which probably covers 250 Hz and below), the highs are not too sharp and there\'s no spike in the high mids (2500-5000 Hz) or in the high end (above 5000 Hz).The only problem is the low mids at around 400 Hz, which thank god they have a fader for that frequency. No matter what brand you choose, low mids are ALWAYS a problem in headphones. By the way, sound separation is excellent once I made that adjustment. Thank Sony for giving you the option!The frequency response when using Bluetooth is between 15 Hz to 17 040 Hz. Beyond that, it starts to wane off. I have up to 19.1 kHz in my right ear and 18.3-18.4 kHz in my left ear, so it\'s not on my side. Considering that my phone has a terrible audio output (it cuts at 15 kHz), it\'s an upgrade for me.Also, considering on how many people listen to their music too loud for the last 25 years, I would be highly surprised that people that claim the high end isn\'t well defined actually know what they are talking about, and most probably don\'t notice the difference. Same thing with audio CODECS disappearing from the XM3 (the XM4 has 3 and the XM3 had 5), above 256 kbps at variable rate and 320 kbps at constant bit rate, you don\'t notice anything if the conversion was done right. Above those values, me and my friend call this ""Placebo Quality"". Compression and brickwalled mixes affect the quality perception GREATLY.Search NPR sound quality test online. It proves my point.So in conclusion, if the song you are listening sounds like garbage, it\'s because it was mixed/mastered like garbage (probably mixed nowadays because they brickwall often at this stage). These are hands down the best headphones I ever tried. Period. Including my Sennheisers that I used for multiple years.Noise cancelation:I was highly surprised at not only the sensation on your eardrum being pushed in not being super apparent compared to other models, which are quite frankly unbearable in the long run, but also the capabilities of phase canceling of these headphones (the actual term of canceling out waveforms is called phase canceling, noise canceling is a marketing term for people not familiar with audio, since the majority of people don\'t know what is phase).Transients (such as impacts) are impossible to isolate because they are too fast to sample and to invert the phase to create cancelation. Steady noises are the only ones that allow the headphones to sample them and invert them, because there\'s a processing delay. Stop hitting a table like someone I know was doing to test headphones, it\'s worthless.The amount that is being canceled out is out of this world compared to previous generations that I have tried. I can\'t wait to try them on a plane. High end will remain because it\'s the most difficult part of the waveform to cancel, since it\'s the most precise and the one that takes up the most information in a signal. I was standing next to a washing machine during its max spin cycle, could barely hear it with audio of people talking in my headphones. Without playback, you hear the high end when you\'re right in front of it. As soon as you close the door, it pretty much vanishes.If you have noisy neighbors or live in an apartment, buy this thing! You won\'t regret it.Battery life: Outlasts my cell phone by a hundred years. In 2 hours of use, not even 10% used. Specs are believable.In conclusion, buy this thing if you are looking for noise canceling!TLDR:-Super comfortable-Amazing in sound-Amazing in noise canceling and battery life matching specs\n', ""\n  These do not work on Samsung TV, just google it. Many people having the same issues as I did.Not 1 millisecond, 1 full second... it could even be more. For a $500 pair of headphones you'd think they'd be able to adjust this latency, or fix it with a software patch. Unfortunately their last software update was Aug 7, 2020 (over 2 months ago).I sent the 1st pair back because they thought it could be an issue with the headphones, and the 2nd pair has the same issues on Samsung TV.I've gone into the Sony headphone app and even set the headphones to (priority on connection) instead of the audio quality setting, and the Bluetooth connection still has a full second audio lag while watching a movie on my Samsung 4k tv. This is incredibly frustrating as you see people's lips moving but don't hear them speak.Disabling DSEE Extreme off/on or on/off seems to reset the audio lag, and fixes the stuttering, but it doesn't last more than 10 minutes.The noise cancelling is amazing, the battery life is amazing, the quick charge is amazing, the ability to connect multiple devices is amazing. They're very light weight and incredibly comfortable.\n""]"
