My last handheld Nintendo console was the black and white Game Boy Pocket in the early 90's, so I've been away from the platform ---- a while.I bought the Switch purely because I learned they had ported Skyrim to it, and as a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls genre I was hoping to devote some of my train commute to questing around Tamriel. In this sense, the Switch does not disappoint. I am not a graphics connoisseur, but - compared to the PC version - Skryim plays really well on the Switch. No perceptible lag, colors are crisp. Yes, it's missing the expansions and yes, the text can be a little small, but that's a fair trade-off for the portability this platform brings.So far, I only own 2 games - Skyrim and MarioKart 8 (another throwback to my college dorm days on the N64), and I love playing both on the Switch, MaroKart is obviously the newer game and so the graphics and gameplay are much better but I'm a still a sucker for Skyrim (at least until the next ES is released, hopefully in my lifetime).Anyway, all this to say the Nintendo Switch is a great console for busy adults who want to reminisce about the fun they had 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. The Switch doesn't take itself too seriously (which I love) but that means it might not be the right choice for people concerned with the perfect graphic or gameplay experience - there are dedicated consoles that do this much better. What the Switch does is make gaming on the go effortless, fun for the average busy person and something you can really enjoy with your whole family - which I think was Nintendo's real goal here all along.\n"", '\n  La consola muy bien y más barata que la versión anterior, mi hermano tiene un Switch y ahora yo quería la versión 1.1.

The Switch Lite although nothing physically wrong with it, is completely useless to me and my family. I have two young kids, and all 3 of us have our own profiles which are linked under my main account via Nintendo ID. The problem is is that only the main account holder (me) can play the purchased games on both devices. So the Switch Lite does not work for either of my kids, only my main account. Yes, this can be switched by changing which Switch device is the ""primary"" switch, but the fact still remains that under NO conditions can my kids play both switch consoles at the same time, even if it is two separate games. If you have cartridges instead of digital downloads, you will not have this problem. I just fail to understand Nintendo\'s logic with this. I understand that they are trying to protect their own content from unauthorized use, but in doing so are rendering their newest device completely useless to customers like me. I will be returning.\n', '\n  I strongly recommend AGAINST buying the Switch Lite. Downloaded content can only be played while connected to the internet. HUGE downside and problem since this is meant to be portable!!! Additionally, my 7 year old son can’t play ANY of the games that we purchased in the E-Shop for him because we purchased them under our adult profiles (a Nintendo rule!). This item is USELESS.\n', ""\n  Basically a budget friendly Nintendo Switch that's meant to be more portable. Unlike the iphone 11 and iphone 11 Pro, Galaxy 10e and Galaxy 10, iphone XR and iphone X, etc it doesn't keep all features the same, just downgraded.In fact like the Nintendo 2DS (compared to 3DS) it actually takes away some features.If you already own a Nintendo Switch console, you can sync* or transfer from your profile/games/saves using your Nintendo account. Very simple; when you boot up system for first time it'll walk you through it step-by-step*If you sync or link one account to multiple switch consoles, the non-main one has to verify every few hours to play downloaded games which can be a hassle if you don't have internet connectionLet's go through the list of changes:1. Size, weight, portabilityOverall size in general: The Switch Lite is basically the Original Switch (I'll be referring it to 'Switch' moving forward) but with one of the joy cons detached.You think this will be more portable, but in practice from my personal experience it's not. If you consider size onlyThe Switch can detach joycons for better storage. Downside is that you must be aware where you put the screen and joycons and attach them later.There is a difference if you pocket thing whole thing without detaching i guessSeeing the smaller size, there may be more hand cramping involved if you have giant adult sized handsSwitch Lite is lighter in weight, but it's not a night-and-day difference. Not going to tell unless you have both side-by-side in each hand.Bezels are colored which is nice. It's not black like on the Switch, so able to distinguish where the screen ends2. No detachable joyconsCannot detach joycons, making the logo snap/click sound clip that game trailers start off/ends with absolutely useless when referring to Switch line of systems in general.As one singular unit, fused into the system; feels more solid in the hand compared to originalDownside is that it loses some functionality in some gamesYou are not able to split controllers to let a friend playSome games that you can't play on Switch Lite out of the box (as of this review) are:1-2 SwitchFitness BoxingJust Dance (Series)Nintendo Labo (Series)Nintendo Lano VRRing Fit AdventuresSuper Mario PartySurgeon SimulatorThere are also other games that's not as convenient to play in handheld only like:ARMSFortnightMario Kart 8 DeluxeMario Tennis AcesPokemon Let's Go seriesSuper Mario OdysseySplatoon 2Zelda Breath of the WildYou can buy joy cons to play on Switch Lite, but that costs additional $70 MSRP. Might as well buy a Switch at that pointIf the thumb sticks breaks or if there are drifting issues, you can have it fixed by Nintendo for $80.3. Cannot be docked to TV, no kick standNo docking station. If you own the Switch with docking station; the Switch Lite cannot fit in it.As of right now, there's no official docking station for Switch Lite from Nintendo, and no 3rd party adaptersNo kickstand to play on tabletop mode. Seeing the smaller screen you wouldn't want to anyway even when a lot of controllers are sync and people squinting their eyes when huddled around the system4. Has a D-Pad.Best feature of the system in my opinion. Better tactile feel when playing. Enhances gameplay especially when playing 2D fightersD-pad and other buttons (ABXY, shoulder buttons) are more muted when pressed which is great when playing in a public setting5.  No IR, HD RumbleThe IR Motion Camera and HD rumble features have been removed. Games that support these features will not work on Switch lite6. Better battery?? 4-7 hours versus the 3-6 hours of the original launch Nintendo Switch.If you buy the newer 2019 model of Switch (Retail box with a lot of Red), the battery life is better than the Switch Lite7. New colorsComes in Turquoise, Grey and YellowThere's also a Pokemon Sword and Shield ( Zacian and Zamazenta) Edition edition8. Smaller screen5.5 vs 6.2 inch screenResolution is the same at 720p, but more compact making it appear sharper with a 267ppi vs 236ppiOverall, I like the concept of a more portable (?), affordable switch, but I don't like the fact that it exists.If it's like the 2ds (with no 3d support). Devs (even first party) will eventually take away features in games in the future: motion controls, AR support, HD rumble, docked TV mode, etc to cater to a wider audience.They should have just made it smaller and kept everything the sameGood buy for those budget friendly, but if you like more options best to go for the upgrade if you can afford it.\n"", ""\n  For those who use/will use the Switch exclusively as a handheld device, I would recommend this system over the original Switch! Here are some things I've noticed in comparison to the original Switch so far:- The Switch Lite is far more comfortable to hold and and use than the original Switch thanks to its smaller size and ' lite'er (hahaha) weight. I can hold this small boi for a lot longer than the larger Switch before having to put it down to rest my hands.- All the buttons have that superior Gameboy Advance button feel, ie: they don't feel a tad too rigid and clicky like those in the larger Switch. Plus there is an actual d-pad here. The system is made of plastic and has a sort of coarse feel to it. It won't slip out of your hands too easily and feels nice to the touch.- Screen size is a bit smaller- 5.5 inches vs the Switch's 6.2 inches, but this ties into the greater ease of use as a handheld as mentioned before. In terms of brightness and display quality I cannot say that I see any large differences. It's possibly a bit better since it's the same 720p but in a smaller screen? Anyway it looks great just like the original (and requires a screen protector just like the original.)- The color schemes for this system are some of the best Nintendo has ever offered in my opinion. The yellow one that I got looks fantastic and I'm glad that I chose this over the turquoise and the Pokemon themed one.- Sound output is slightly lower in terms of volume than the original Switch. This is probably because the speakers are on the underside of the system as opposed to the front. This is a minor thing though, you'll still hear your games well enough.- The battery looks to be draining at a similar or slightly slower rate that the original (release day) Switch. However keep in mind that the newer shipments of the original Nintendo Switch are supposed to have a larger battery life.- You will of course be missing out on a number of features: no docking to the TV/monitor, no detachable controllers, no HD rumble or IR camera, no kickstand. However as mentioned before this a pure handheld, and I believe it serves that purpose better than its larger brethren.For anyone who already owns a Switch and is interested in this system, it's a no-brainer. The Switch Lite is maybe the best handheld made by Nintendo so far. If you are choosing between the Switch Lite and the original Switch however, the decision becomes more difficult. I play most Switch games in handheld mode. If I had to choose between one of these today, I would probably choose the Switch Lite. If you like playing games on a larger screen, or you play local multiplayer games (Super Smash Bros. comes to mind) you probably should go with the original Switch. You'll have a lesser handheld experience, but you'll also be getting some really great features that you'd miss out on with the Switch Lite.\n"", ""\n  If you already own a Switch console (the dockable one) or a 2DS/3DS and are wondering if the Switch Lite is worth picking up, let me help you decide. The OG Switch has been reviewed to death, so this review will only cover the major differences between consoles as they are essentially the same things from a hardware standpoint.TLDR: Don't replace your current Switch with this if you have one already. Definitely replace your 2DS/3DS with this if you're in the market for a new handheld.--------------------------------If you play or plan on playing your current Switch docked AT ALL, the answer is no. Don't buy this. Besides the obvious fact this cannot dock and output it's display to a TV, this is NOT a console built with local multiplayer in mind. Yes, you CAN connect JoyCons to it, prop it up against something, and play multiplayer games all on the Switch Lite. Just consider the fact that the OG Switch can also do that, and it does it much better. If you're looking for a home console for your family, the Switch Lite ain't it chief.If you've never once docked your Switch and are looking for a smaller, lighter Switch with no creaky plastic, this is EXACTLY what you are looking for. Is it worth shelling out 250 of your hard earned Canadian dollars if you already own a Switch though? Probably not, unless you plan on selling your old Switch.If you own a 2DS/3DS (or are looking to buy one) and aren't sure if it's worth getting this over those, just keep in mind that the Switch Lite is positioned in the market to kill off the older DS models. Nintendo has no plans for supporting the DS ecosystem going forward. For $50 more than a 3DS, you're getting access to a massive library of games on Nintendo's modern console. It's a no brainer.The Switch Lite is the spiritual successor to the PlayStation Vita, not a doubt in my mind. If you are the type of person who plays games on the go and wants a more modern library of games, this is the console to get.--------------------------------Minor/Major gripes with the Switch Lite:Major Gripe - The D-pad is atrocious. I am mainly a SSB and Street Fighter player, and I am unable to consistently hit certain moves that require a diagonal press. The D-Pad on the Switch Lite is 'shallow', it doesn't stand tall from the case and I find it incredibly difficult to consistently hit diagonal movements. This is unfortunate, because comparing the D-Pad on the Switch Lite to the PlayStation Vita (both the OLED and Slim models), the D-Pad on the Switch Lite feels like an afterthought and I honestly would have preferred they kept the same button layout as the JoyCons. If you plan on playing SSB or Street Fighter, you may find it frustrating to pull off certain moves. For every other use case, it should serve you just fine.Major Gripe - The Switch Lite doesn't have standard Bluetooth connectivity, which I think is honestly the dumbest decision Nintendo has made with the Switch consoles. If you want to use headphones with this, they either must be wired OR you have to buy a third party Bluetooth adapter to connect your headphones. Great, another thing to carry with your portable console.Minor Gripe - The game cartridge cover/flap that covers the slot feels really cheap and flexible, just a light press on it when it's closed causes the entire cover to bend and flex, which doesn't inspire a whole lot of confidence if you're giving this to a child who isn't gentle with their belongings. It's great that the rest of the console itself feels solid and sturdy, but I can't help but feel that if someone drops their Switch Lite, that little cover is going to snap off/pop open and the game cart might come flying out.Minor Gripe - The screen comes calibrated from Nintendo with a different color temperature compared to the OG Switch. Colors appear warmer on the Switch Lite, which I personally don't care about at all but it was noticable and to some of you considering this, might actually be a deal breaker (you know who you are). Because color accuracy and temperature preferences are personal, I will not outwardly say which screen is objectively better because that is a completely subjective preference. I will say that I personally prefer the screen on the Switch Lite.--------------------------------I'll try to keep this review updated while I use the Switch Lite and discover more things I like and don't like about it. For my use case, it's a perfect replacement of my original Switch console and solves nearly every issue I had with the OG Switch.\n"", '\n  La consola me gustó mucho, su tamaño es realmente pequeño y es muy ligera, es perfecta para viajes movidos (se que la Switch original es portatil tambien, pero tiene un tamaño y peso considerable, que a veces la hacen un poco molesta para llevar en la mochila), el único problema que tuve es que la consola llegó con algunos raspones, al igual que la caja llegó golpeada, recomiendo a Amazon ser más cuidadoso a la hora de empaquetar las cosas,  no es la primera vez que un producto me llega golpeado (juegos sueltos, rayones, cajas golpeadas, abiertas, etc). Recomiendo la consola si la quieres usar para viajar por ejemplo, no te vas a arrepentir.\n', ""\n  Great console highly recommendedPros:Much more portable and much easier to hold in the hand.Due to the fact the joycons are not detachable the console feels much better built and robust. Where as the original switch felt a bit flimsy.Great size perfect for travel, commutes or kidsImproved battery lifeScreen is sharper due to the higher PPIBetter buttonsCons:The colours aren't as vibrant in real lifeThe finish is a bit rough and prone to scuffs.This is the perfect secondary Switch or Switch for the kids. Much better build quality than the original. Now, is it worth saving the 100 bucks and buying the Lite over the revamped switch? That is up to you. For just 100 dollars more you get detachable joycons, the ability to dock, the dock and much better battery life . However, there is something to be said for the build quality. I chose this over another Switch.\n"", '\n  Compré el color amarillo y gris, particularmente recomiendo el amarillo se ve mucho mejor y no se le hacen marcas de uso como al gris.Ésta consola es la mejor que pueda haber existido en el segmento portátil, pues puedes jugar muchísimos títulos recientes que están disponibles para Pc, Xbox one y Ps4 en la palma de tu mando.Se siente muy cómoda al momento de jugar incluso por un largo tiempo, la pantalla tiene muy buen brillo y la resolución no se siente mala, su duración de batería es casi del doble en comparación con la switch normal.Pros: Duración de la batería, ahora si la portabilidad, buena jugabilidad y sensación de los botones, cero calentamiento y ruido del ventilador.Contras: Hasta ahora ninguno, solamente como detalle, si quieres jugar con el control pro o con otros joy cons no tiene como mantenerse de pie y la pantalla dividida para jugar con otra persona es muy incómodo casi no se alcanza a distinguir.No dudes en adquirir esta consola, el servicio de Amazon es extraordinario, y sobre todo el precio, yo las compré en oferta relámpago y con dos meses de bonificación con citibanamex en poco menos de $4,000 pesos.\n', ""\n  If you are on the fence as to whether or not you are going to invest in a Nintendo Switch Lite let me start by saying it's definitely worth it! The unit has a great feel in your hand with a matted plastic finish. It's great for not being a fingerprint magnet. The display is very sharp and clear and looks great when playing. You could almost say that the Switch Lite is the successor to the DS family of handhelds. I already own a regular switch but I'm glad I made the move to the portable version!\n""]"

No, not worth it at all.\n"", '\n  The Nintendo is cool and all but I got price gouged hard on it. I promised my kid one for Quarantine. Apparently people have been buying them out to resell on ebay and Amazon. I am one of those victims.\n', ""\n  This is my review of the 'V2' (2019) version of the Nintendo Switch (model #HAC-001(-01)).So a little background, I was a enthusiastic PC gamer in college who built my own PCs for the purpose and am now - due to the demands of adulthood - someone who only plays the occasional game. My last handheld Nintendo console was the black and white Game Boy Pocket in the early 90's, so I've been away from the platform ---- a while.I bought the Switch purely because I learned they had ported Skyrim to it, and as a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls genre I was hoping to devote some of my train commute to questing around Tamriel. In this sense, the Switch does not disappoint. I am not a graphics connoisseur, but - compared to the PC version - Skryim plays really well on the Switch. No perceptible lag, colors are crisp. Yes, it's missing the expansions and yes, the text can be a little small, but that's a fair trade-off for the portability this platform brings.So far, I only own 2 games - Skyrim and MarioKart 8 (another throwback to my college dorm days on the N64), and I love playing both on the Switch, MaroKart is obviously the newer game and so the graphics and gameplay are much better but I'm a still a sucker for Skyrim (at least until the next ES is released, hopefully in my lifetime).Anyway, all this to say the Nintendo Switch is a great console for busy adults who want to reminisce about the fun they had 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. The Switch doesn't take itself too seriously (which I love) but that means it might not be the right choice for people concerned with the perfect graphic or gameplay experience - there are dedicated consoles that do this much better. What the Switch does is make gaming on the go effortless, fun for the average busy person and something you can really enjoy with your whole family - which I think was Nintendo's real goal here all along.\n"", '\n  La consola muy bien y más barata que la versión anterior, mi hermano tiene un Switch y ahora yo quería la versión 1.1. Todo perfecto, de hecho llego muy rápido pero el detalle fue que la caja venía dañada y muy sucia: polveada y con manchas como de aceite. Para mi la caja importa por que las colecciono. Además la caja no venía sellada, se nota que los manuales, joycons y la pantalla habían sido removidos por alguien. Hace dudar que sea 100% nueva la consola. Al ser un comprador recurrente de Amazon incluso Prime, esto me ha decepcionado un poco.\n', ""\n  While the system is beautiful I have never bought a special edition console that didn't come with the game it was based on and therefore assumed this one came with the new Animal Crossing. Wasn't expecting to drop another 80$ for the game and it's not really specifically stated that it didn't come with it. My Animal Crossing 3DS came with the game and my Windwaker WiiU came with the game.

Namely the ""Wet Cleaning Wipe"" and the ""Dust Removal Stickers"". The included Wet Cleaning Wipes claim to contain water and alcohol. Seems harmless, however after using the Wet Wipe on our brand new Switch\'s screen (before applying the protector), the screen was left with horrible white streaking that would not wipe off AT ALL. It would not come off by using the wet wipes again, would not come off with the Dry Wipe, nor water, nor soapy water, no matter how hard we tried. The white streaks are somehow permanently part of the screen. It seems that either the solution etched the screen or had an adverse chemical reaction with the screen material that caused this permanent streaking. I advise cleaning with warm lightly soapy water, then distilled water, instead of the included Wet Wipes. The included Step 2: DRY Cleaning Wipes do their job well though.The kit also includes what right there on the back of the Kit\'s own box are called ""Dust Removal Stickers"", as well as here on the item page... these are identical to the dust removal stickers the company includes with their other screen protector kits, for use to REMOVE DUST before applying the protector... however, if you actually read the super tiny text on the ""Dust Removal Stickers"" included with this Switch Kit, they say ""Please DON\'T use this to remove dust from the Nintendo Switch"". Whaaat?!?! And these stickers don\'t have that text on them in the other kits, those are identical aside from tiny text saying ""Dust Removal Stickers"". So why even include these with the Switch and call them Dust removal stickers on this page and on the product box?  But yeah, even though the box says ""Dust removal Stickers"", don\'t use them for dust because the adhesive on them, which the company was apparently too lazy to change for specific use on the Switch, is too sticky when on the Switch screen and will leave adhesive residue behind.This is so unfortunate, having a brand new Switch screen completely ruined by a kit that was intended to protect that screen. And even moreso because it was completely avoidable had the company simply included Switch-friendly wipes and dust removal stickers, or not included them at all.The screen protector itself is pretty great looking and relatively easy to apply without any bubbles at all. There are a few very small specks/inclusions that look a bit like specks of dust suspended within the protector glass itself. Hopefully that is a fluke/rare case. It should also be noted that once the screen protector was applied to the now damaged screen, the streaking, which is so very bad and stood out like a sore thumb, is now pretty much invisible due to the protector adhesive sealing to the surface. However, the entire point of this purchase was to protect the Switch screen from damage, and this kit did exactly the opposite, it destroyed the screen. Now the only way to keep the display looking nice will be by having these protectors applied to the screen. It will never look undamaged again without one.Bottom line: Had the manufacturer given more care to providing materials safe for the Switch Screen, this would have easily been a raving 5 star review. I highly recommend the protector itself, but not this kit as a whole. Play it safe and do not use the included ""Wet Cleaning Wipes"" on your Switch screen, nor the included ""Dust Removal Stickers"". The protector itself looks great and applies incredibly easily, so just use safer means of cleaning before applying the protector.\n', ""\n  Theres no bottom line this morning was half asleep moving my items around and dropped it from chest height onto slate rock..I was mortified..I picked it up and saw scratches and cracks and lost my darn mind. (I've had the switch since around launch when I got this protector for it. I know its plastic but it still will scratch the hell out of your switch.) I sat down and peeled it away. It was what got scratched and dented etc, the rest of my switch is fine I'm ordering another pack right now and I am going to be more careful in the future..lol\n"", '\n  Bought a Nintendo Switch for the kids for Christmas. Took the store salesman\'s advice and bought this screen protector. Installed it Christmas Eve, nice and easy. Three months later, the 4 year old drops the Switch down the hardwood stairs. Shortly thereafter, the teenage sibling says ""uh oh!"" The screen appears shattered. I\'m imagining the aggravation of using the in store warranty and what that\'s going to be like when the teenager says ""Do you think it\'s just the screen protector?"" I\'m thinking ""no way"" but I peel it back and to my amazement, it is! The screen protector absorbed the hard impact of the corner of the hardwood stairs and protected the screen of the Switch from damage. This product truly delivers on it\'s promise to protect the screen! Since it\'s a 2 pack, I pull out the spare, clean the screen with the provided wipes and apply the new protector. Easy peasy. I\'m extremely happy with this product and as soon as I\'m finished writing this review, I\'m ordering another pack. The two photos I\'ve provided show the damage that the protector absorbed and after the new protector has been applied.\n', ""\n  Simply Great! Easiest installation of a screen protector ever and I've installed a few over the years.  It went on like magic.  No bubbles, no dust, nothing.  Remarkable.  If you've ever had dust or air bubble then you know how frustrating it is to install screen protector.  So here is the thing, read the instructions.  Sounds like a no brainer, but my first installation with this guy went horribly wrong and it was my own fault.  Since I've installed these in the past I just rushed in and it was not fun.  Second time around I followed the instructions and it was so easy and perfect.  Dust is not what you want so do yourself a big favor and run a hot shower with the fan off for a few minutes and then install in the bathroom.  The steam pulls the dust right out of the air.  Doing this makes it install easily in just a few minutes.  Do not hesitate to buy!\n"", ""\n  Not a knock on the seller cause it could just have been a bad batch, but anyway. The screen protectors went on very easy, they came with a cleaning cloths, wet wipes, dry wipes, and those little sticker things for random hairs and dust. Well it was a brand new switch so for the first one I didn't do much besides a quick wipe with the cleabing cloth. It litterally looked like I poured water full of dust on the screen. There were like 20+ bubbles behind it. I am usully very good with these, but I could have messed up. So, no worries I have another shot as it came with extras. I made sure I had lots of light and that the surface was free of any dust or stuff that may have caused these issues. I cleaned the screen with the wet wipe, the dry wipe then a quick sweep with a new cleaning cloth (no dust). I made sure it was lined up and gently appled from one side to the other and some how there were even more bubbles. We drove out to gamestop and got one of the Nyko Tempered Glass ones and followed the same process. Came out perfect, no bubbles, no dust, and you almost couldn't tell it even had one on it. So, pretty much confirming these ones were junk.\n"", ""\n  I VERY rarely write reviews on here, but I feel a sense of duty to alert my fellow Switch owners to this fantastic product!I've put countless screen protectors on various devices over the years, and I can honestly say none have been as high quality and effortless to install as this one. It comes with alcohol wipes to clean the\xa0screen, then it's just a case of holding the\xa0side tabs to carefully line it up while you lower it into position...then stand back and watch as the adhesive spreads perfectly from one side of the\xa0screen to the other. Not a bubble or dust speck in sight!Compared to the rival product I tried and ended up binning in frustration, this was a dream to apply.Having used different brand screen protectors for years, I'll now be on the lookout for amFilm screen protectors for every future device I own.\n"", '\n  I looked at lots of reviews before deciding on the AM film screen protector for my daughters Nintendo Switch. I’m glad I chose this one as it’s the best screen protector I have ever used, it was so easy to apply, the screen responsiveness isn’t affected and the switch docks with no problems. Yesterday I accidentally sent the switch flying whilst it was docked off the tv unit and onto the hard laminate floor, as you can see from the photo it’s done it’s job in protecting the screen as its taken the hit. Im so relieved I had the protector on because if I hadn’t the screen would have smashed/cracked without a doubt. A must have buy for all switch owners.\n', ""\n  Tempered Glass is always a bit of a funny thing to review, cos without dropping the product was bought for to test - you hope to never know how good it really is.Bought these cos treat self to a Switch before Christmas, and, whilst not a clumsy person, didn't want to risk any damage to it.Applied whilst console still in box (before set it up etc), thus preventing any problems straightaway.Installation was easy enough, not really much can be done - you align it with product notches/cut-outs, peel off one side and carefully apply it to screen.  Then usually peel off another thin film layer (cannot remember if I done that with these though).Since applying 2wks ago, Im still yet to drop Switch and hopefully never will.I can safely say though, that having a second sheet of glass in box is a bonus.  Fact that I've used the touch screen aspect of Switch a few times, and not noticed any problems with this applied is another big plus.Overall, very pleased with this manufacturers product and highly recommend it to ALL Switch users (also recommend their glass for other devices too).\n"", ""\n  I waited a while before giving this review because I was unsure of the longevity of a glass screen protector on a plastic display.I'm several months in at this point and it's still firmly attached without a single mark on it.Touch sensitivity has not been effected at all by having it installed. It also doesn't effect the docking process.Normally a screen protector compromises the feel of the display, but as the switch display is plastic, having this on actually makes it feel better. Also, a complaint that I hear from most owners is that the dock actually scratches the display due to rubbing the edges over time. The screen protector resists this very well due to the glass being much harder than the plastic.If you have a switch without 1 of these installed then you're no getting the best experience, but you're also simply not protected.\n"", ""\n  An excellent product, with fantastic results providing the application is undertaken extremely carefully.Practice manoeuvring the tempered glass panel into place. Practice a lot, as the final application must be swift - dust particles accumulate with frightening speed.Watch youtube videos for demonstrations of applying the screenTake your time carefully cleaning the Switch's plastic screen; be aware that the wet alcohol cleaning cloths are very wet indeed.Dry off the screen with the Dry wipe, and apply the protector as quickly, but precisely as possible - as soon as the film is removed from the glass, it, and the Switch's screen, will begin attracting dust.I used the 'bathroom methid' - creating stream via the shower to help reduce dust in the air.I also used a headlamp torch to illuminate dust - once it's trapped under the glass it isn't getting out again!Take your time swiping out any air bubbles which may form.I had to use both protectors as the Switch screen was gathering dust after I'd removed the film on the glass panel. Ended up with dust in both screen and panel - cleaned the switch screen again, and used the second panel.Result is as close to perfect as I could get without access to a NASA clean room...Take time. Practice. Try not to panic!\n""]"

Only problem was that the smaller cases I found would hold the switch and possibly some games, however, I wasn’t able to carry along the cables or dock in case I wanted to connect to a tv elsewhere when I travel.  The cases that I found that did were large, like a full backpack or messenger bag and not at all convenient.  I’ve been using this case the last few days over the holidays while seeing friends and this thing is amazing.  It actually even holds better than what the case description shows on Amazon and the sleeve that covers the case when you first open the box that it’s shipped in (several pictures included).  I can carry the Switch with joycons, dock, power supply, pro controller, joycon controller, 18 total cart games, headphones and likely other accessories I can’t think of all in one compact case.  Major bonus points that this case feels and is sturdy where I feel that my Switch and equipment are completely safe.  If you’re looking for something convenient to carry around most of, if not all of your Switch gear- you’ve come to the right place.  Highly highly recommend!\n', ""\n  The product is exactly as advertised. I am happy with it overall.  I would caution other buyers about three aspects of the case:(1) The mesh is too small and tight for my liking. It is difficult to fit much in the mesh without either straining the mesh to a distressing degree or putting so much pressure on the objects in the mesh that you worry about whether the products are being too tightly constrained.(2) The side-slots, advertised as being for the joy cons + grips, are snug. As a general matter, that's good; the joy cons + grip should not rattle around in those slots. But the tradeoff is that if a grip is (a) wider or (b) longer than the grip that comes with the Switch, that non-standard grip may not fit in those side-slots.(3) The strap that comes with the case is miniscule. I hoped for something I could wear along my shoulder and maybe across my chest. But that is not doable with this strap. I regrettably do not have a ruler to measure the strap, but it is no longer than a foot. The strap's length makes it virtually useless if you intended to use it for easier portability—assuming you aren't a 3- or 4-year-old, of course. The strap still has its uses: for example, hanging the case from a rack. But unfortunately it offers little else.Overall, it's a good case. It feels impressively sturdy. It looks nondescript; people will be less likely to steal your Switch when using this case, as opposed to some other cases that brazenly advertise their valuable contents. And it does hold almost everything you could possibly want to carry. I would purchase this case again.I will update this review if my opinions change. Thank you for reading.\n"", '\n  I like the product. It is very sturdy, has all the compartments you need and easy to carry.  Inside the package a note from ivoler says to email them for life time warranty. Sounded nice, so we are trying to sign up for it and oh boy so many steps! First you have to email them then they send you back with a link which takes you to Facebook messenger then it leads to a google form and they ask you again the order number etc etc and right before you can submit it makes you write a amazon review!

If you are planning on traveling somewhere far and need or want to take your Nintendo Switch buy this case, well built and will protect your investment.\n"", ""\n  I picked this up when I bought my Nintendo Switch.

I just hold the microSD to SD adaptor in there since I like to have a mostly digital game library.I don't really anticipate it being stellar at protecting my Switch from tons of force or really bad weather/outdoor conditions. It does what I need it to do - organize and carry all of my Switch gear in a convenient manner. The rubberized handle is nice to hold (won't slip from your hand if you're holding it normally) and the shoulder strap is nice too if I need to hold something else with my hand.

Heard about the Genki when it was in the planning stages and was excited when it finally released. (Yes, I waited for the Genki and didn't go for the other ones that popped up all of a sudden)This does bring blue tooth connectivity to the Switch but with a catch. First off, when connected to a single wireless headphone, these work great. I have a Turtle Beach wired headset but I had purchased a blue tooth adapter for my wired headphones two years ago. Plugged my Turtle Beach into that adapter and plugged in the Genki into the Switch, and voila! Kind of a lot to get wireless sound, I know. However, I also have a blue tooth ear bud that I tried and they work fabulously, although with sound in just one ear.Here is the catch, and why the Genki get's 4 stars instead of five. I have a pair of Bose wireless earbuds that I got for Christmas. I was hoping to be able to connect them to the Genki and get my sound through them. Unfortunately, the Genki will connect to them but, because each ear bud is connecting through blue tooth, the Genki sees it (behind the curtain) as 2 earbuds, causing very noticeable latency. This is also the case if you were to connect to distinct blue tooth headphones to the Genki, one on the red and one on the blue. If Genki could work out that kink and allow for zero latency for multiple devices, I would give it 5 stars.\n"", ""\n  I was really dissapointed by this product. I tried 5 different  BT headphones. Beats solo 2, apple ear buds, anker soundcore, beats wireless x And JLabs. All had audio lag to the point where it was unplayable my coworker has the homespot,  I tried it out with my beats and works well. I'm sending these back.\n"", ""\n  Overall the product does as advertised. There is a slight bit of Latency I noticed while using my beats solo wireless 3, gear iconx earphones, and Bose Quiet Comfort's althought it does not make games unplayable. Overall I'm happy with the product but I do believe that for the $50 price tag it should be Latency free and if not they should at the very least include the stand with he package.\n"", ""\n  I have a receiver supporting AAC and SBC codec only, and it worked only with SBC so I experienced nearly 200~300ms delay. While testing with Sony 1000Xm2, there wasn't the annoying delay and I found that is due to the codec(1000Xm2 supports aptX-HD).If you want to use Genki, you should prepare any receiver supporting at least aptX. It seems that AAC not guaranteed according to the real spec of receiver.\n"", '\n  I purchased this for an upcoming trip, and thought this would be great for Bluetooth audio and charging. But after about 38 days it will not connect to the headphones I had previously been able to connect with. Also I noticed that the right button for player does not click anymore. The lights on the from of the unit will flash dimly then brightly sometimes when touched making me believe that there is an issue with the internal circuit board. I am outside of the 30 day return/exchange warranty and will be purchasing a different unit. Current setup with switch was Steel Series Arctic 3 Bluetooth 2019 Edition, which connects fine with my phone with ease and was not connected to my phone or any devices when trouble shooting.\n', '\n  For a brief moment it was a beautiful connection and then it just.. died. I have had my eye on a Bluetooth connector for my switch for a long while now. Having to stay home it finally made sense to pull the trigger on this one and genki was always the brand on my wishlist. I was so excited when it arrived, plugged it in and it connected very smoothly to my Air pods. The sound was amazing! I felt like my switch finally came alive in hand held mode. Until it disconnected after 5 min of playing.I thought maybe it was my headphones, but I couldn’t get the device to respond to connect to a different set. I tried resetting it after Reading the FAQ, and it connected for 5 seconds and went out again. I tried connecting it to my pc and it worked for a while, I had 20 min of connection and started to think it was my switch when I got an error notice that there was a problem with the device. I emailed support and have not heard backI hear this is a great product with great customer support, so far I have been very disappointed.\n', '\n  My mic doesnt work and there is no clear instructions on how to make it work. Also my package is missing the kickstand which doesnt say anywhere that its suppose to come with it but I saw a guy in YouTube who was reviewing the product and his came with a kickstand inside the package where there is clearly an empty slot for something. Been trying to figure out how to use the mic for fortnite for a couple days but nothing has worked so far. My bluetooth ear piece connect properly and I can hear the games and people in games perfectly fine but the Mic piece or feature does not work. Not worth the money. And what happened to the kickstand ??\n', ""\n  Right out of the nice Nintendo switch case, you can plug it in a play. It's very intuitive. Hold the pairing button for 3 seconds and it connects. I also like that it keeps your headphones paired even when you to the switch off then turn it back on (as long as it stays plugged in). you can also charge it plugged in which is good for people like me who travel via train a lot in Korea with a battery pack.It also comes with with an 3.0 usb adapter so now I can use bluetooth headphones with my computer.I cannot praise the simplicity of this product enough. My only qualm is that I wish it was a little shorter so the dongle didn't stick out too much but it's lightweight.\n"", ""\n  The Nintendo Switch having no Bluetooth was a surprising choice for Nintendo.Fortunately, the GENKI Bluetooth adapter is a fantastic accessory for fans of the Nintendo Switch. It is straightforward to use and looks the part as well. It comes packaged in a box that looks like a Nintendo Switch game, which I thought was cool.Inside you get the adapter for the Switch, which fits nicely into the USB-C port, as well as a boom mic. I loved the fact that you can pair two headsets at the same time. Another positive feature of this product is that I didn't notice it using too much of the Switch's battery power.This product is perfect for your late-night gaming sessions, or for when you're travelling.I highly recommend purchasing this product if you want to have the freedom of wireless earphones with your Switch.\n"", '\n  Used for wireless head phones on the switch - excellent - great sound and looks pleasing to the eye too. Great product\n', '\n  Thank you, it was a lovely item in perfect condition, works brilliant pairing the AirPods Pro With the switch.\n', '\n  Great little gadget and especially love that you can use this when it’s docked too. Nothing bad about it\n', '\n  Works perfectly, no problems great value for money\n']"
