Please read my tips, it may help you and save some frustration and even maybe save you from returning it.  To get that max speeds this needs to be installed in a PCIe 4.0 compatible motherboard with a PCIe 4.0 compatible CPU.  I am using this in an Asus X570 Tuf Gaming Plus with a Ryzen 3900X.  This also needs to be installed in the M.2 slot closest to the CPU which has a direct connection to the CPU, I initially had it in the bottom slot below the PCIe slots and that one is connected to the chipset which is slower, I was getting like half the write speeds at first until I switched it.  You also need to download and install the WD SSD Dashboard so you can enable the Gaming Mode, otherwise again, speeds won't be as fast.  After those couple things, I am now getting close to advertised speeds and I am happy.  I will update my review if anything changes down the road.\n"", '\n  Easy install but be sure to use a slot off the CPU and not the motherboard as my TRX0-40 that slot not work.The speed score by cloning was way too low.  I had to install from a Windows USB from scratch. to get the high speed.  I have other WD and Seagate and an Intel 900P and would not buy to swap as not all that much faster.For new installs this is the top SSD to use. I would like to hear from others the magic to obtain 38781 speed on Passmark. My rig is a Threadripper 3970x  Yes this new WD drive as my old similar others does not crash.\n', ""\n  Getting similar numbers to TweakTown's review. Great for gaming, programming, and content creation. It's noticeably faster than the HP EX950 I just replaced, which was already pretty dang fast.\n"", '\n  Had to update BIOS on my Asus X570 Ace to get it to work. Was worth the effort though. 7000 MB/s.\n', '\n  I purchased both the WD SN850 2TB and Samsung 980 Pro 1TB. Plan was to install W10 on the Samsung and games on the WD (until it filled up). Good or bad, installed the Samsung in the m.2 slot closest to the CPU and the WD in the further away slot. Didn’t know at the time this would make a difference. Results are Samsung has read speeds around 7000 and the WD has speeds around 6000. Bottom line, which m.2 slot one puts the drive in is important. Do I switch...haven’t decided. If I do, my Samsung will just get lower speeds. However both have great performance so will leave as is for now. Boot time is quick. Resume from sleep is 4-5 seconds. Games load pretty fast. Satisfied all around.\n', '\n  Undetectable by Windows or certain OSs when used with some USB-C Gen2 connections.  Very odd, did work with a USB-A Gen2 connector but not with all C plugs.  Using with USB-C Gen1 also failed to be detected. Likely something to do with the Gen4 PCIe design incapability with USB-C Gen 1 and certain Gen2.  Best to use only with M.2 connection.\n', ""\n  This one is the fastest I've ever used! Bought it for a new build and installed my OS on it. Reboots are under 20 seconds start to finish!

Windows 10 detected it immediately and performance even on a Gen 3 motherboard was excellent.I ended up needing more space on my motherboard 2x M.2 slots, but the drive itself delivered in every way.5/5\n', ""\n  I can't really say how much of an improvement this drive made over my previous 970 evo NVME because it is part of a new build along with new Ryzen 5950x, 32GB (3200) Ram and PCI Express 4 motherboard all on a fresh Windows install.What I can say is that a real world system (Kaspersky, utilities, MS Office, Steam, RGB etc) is fast to startup and in use. Windows boots to fully usable state in about 3-4 seconds (from BIOS splash). Windows actually finishes booting about the time my monitor has started from standby.Chrome appears instantly as soon as my finger raises on a mouse click from the taskbar. Explorer windows take about half a second to open.Games load incredibly quickly as well. I've been replaying Portal 2 and the load screen are much faster.The utility software that comes bundled looks cool and has all the features you would expect. I've used it to upgrade the firmware and that went fine.One thing I did notice was that gaming mode was off by default. Gaming mode basically just turns off power saving. Depending on whether you care if Greta cries or not, you might want to turn gaming mode on.Some people are complaining about lack of screws. TBH I'd agree with WD on this. The M.2 screws come with your motherboard and are not guaranteed to be the same across every board (many are the same, I think ASUS tend to use different ones). If they supplied screws that might or might not fit and people ended up damaging the threads on their motherboards, people would be complaining. The reason that screws come with retail and some oem 2.5 SSDs and hard drives is because the screws go into the drive itself, not the motherboard.So overall really difficult for me to say that the drive will make a system superfast and stable, but I can certainly that it is not a bottleneck that will stop a system from being superfast and stable.\n"", ""\n  Very impressive Western Digital SN850 NVMe 2280 drive for gaming! I noticed it is more responsive than Samsung 980 Pro while gaming. I do highly recommend this drive especially for newer and latest Gaming Laptops.

You already know which way this is going.Not much needs to be said. We buy NVME drives for speed, plain and simple. If I wanted massive disk space, I'd shell out $100 for a cool 4TB of plattered goodness. But prior to this, I was running a SATA SSD which was nice, but actually became a bottleneck while gaming / multitasking.Enter the Crucial 500GB NVME. Looks great on paper, right? Yea I thought so too, and shelled out my hard earned (yea we don't really have surplus $$$ these days) with the expectation that throughput would jump, per their advertised speeds.Please note I wasn't expecting the world. 2400MB reads would have been nice, but not necessary. Well, as you can see from my llil graphic there, max speeds it ain't. Yes, I re-ran the test several times, while the system was otherwise unloaded. FYI this is on a newly installed Windows 10 Pro system with an i3-9100 and 32GB of memory.So yea, I'm sad. Not really worth the time / money to return it, since Amazon now requires that we go out into public during a global pandemic to hand off the faulty item. And like I said, it is faster than my former SATA. But absolutely not by enough to justify the expenditure :(Happy holidays? I think not.Edit: RE vendor reply. Guys, it was nice of you to reply via automated bot, but per usual it misses the entire point of my review. This is a NEW drive, with NEW Windows 10 install. There's no garbage to be collected, nor any sign that trim isn't functioning as expected. If you'd done the right and proper thing by sending me a replacement unit, at a minimum to tell if it was my setup or the drive, I could bump this up to a 3 (if same issue) or 5 if speeds improved. But instead you gave me the new car equivalent of - have you checked the Johnson rod? There's no sign of malfunction, but it couldn't be an issue with what we just sold you so, yea go troubleshoot, or something. Thanks?\n"", ""\n  It is an amazing second boot drive for my Linux install and it works amazingly for everyday development tasks, I didn't test much gaming on it but from the load times of some of my more demanding programs, it seems like it would be good for that too!

Well...they are, but you have to do things in really precise steps to get them to work. First off, forget their cloning software. I never could get it to work. Also, you cannot install these in an external M2 container and plug them into a USB port.  What you do is use Windows 10 online tool ""Windows Install -> create installation media, usb drive, etc."" And turn off BotLocker! The install SW will port you old windows 10 serial # and license over. Open up your Lenovo, unplug the battery and remove the SSD. Put in the new one. Plug the battery in. Hold down F12 to get the boot BIOS and select USB. Exit and restart. Follow the directions and you will install windows on your new drive. Then you get the hassle of installing Words, Excel, and your other software. If you buy an external holder for the old drive, you can just use it as a very large thumb drive and speed this up.

Auf der Hauptplatine ist die Diagnoseleuchte für ""VGA"" angesprungen, also für die Grafikkarte. Wie das zusammenhängt? Absolut keine Ahnung.Habe mich dann daran erinnert, dass es häufig hilfreich ist, die aktuellste BIOS Version, also quasi das Grundbetriebsystem eines Rechners, wenn man das so formulieren möchte, aufzuspielen.

Bei Dateien die etwas verteilt sind und aus kleineren Datenblöcken bestehen, erreiche ich noch etwa 1200 MB pro Sekunde.Beim Schreiben fällt diese Einsteiger NVMe SSD gegenüber den ""Profilaufwerken"" etwas ab: So sind zu Beginn noch große Datenraten erreichbar, jedoch steigt die Temperatur des Controllers auf der SSD recht schnell an, wodurch man dann nach kurzer Zeit bei etwa 300 bis 400 MB/Sekunde Schreibgeschwindigkeit landet.Greift man auf Daten überwiegend lesend zu, ist das Laufwerk, auch gerade durch den Preisrutsch (Seit Sommer 2020 von etwa 150 Euro auf unter 90 Euro im November) bedingt, durchaus empfehlenswert.Crucial ist eine Marke von Micron Technology, einer der ältesten und renommiertesten Hersteller von Speicherlösungen, gegründet 1978. Hier kann man relativ bedenkenlos von Qualität ausgehen. Das Laufwerk wird mit einer Lebenschreibleistung von 300 TBW (Bei der 1 TB Variante, 150 TBW bei der 500 GB Variante) angegeben. Dies bedeutet, dass man über einen Zeitraum von fünf Jahren täglich 164 Gigabyte auf das Laufwerk schreiben darf, was den meisten Privatanwendern eher schwer fallen dürfte. Die Herstellergarantie fällt mit fünf Jahren ebenfalls recht lange aus.Alles in allem ein positiver Eindruck bislang. Sehr gutes Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis.\n', '\n  I purchased a Crucial P2 1TB for a Dell Inspiron 5680 (used Crucial scanning tool from their website to check compatibility and also contacted Crucial via chat on their website to double check).Unfortunately this SSD would not show up in the BIOS, device manager or disk management.At the time I was using the latest BIOS release for the Dell Inspiron 5680 (with Dell’s recommended BIOS settings for this drive as contacted Dell for help) and there were no firmware updates for the P2.This drive would have been the primary OS drive but was unable to install Windows 10 on it as no drive showed up.After installing and booting Windows 10 onto a separate HDD, the P2 failed to show up in either device manager or disk management so was unable to initialize it and test as a secondary drive even.Crucial assured me that this part was compatible with a Dell Inspiron 5680 prior to purchasing, so in the end I tried two different Crucial P2 1TB SSD’s however neither worked.Contacted both Crucial and Dell for assistance, neither were able to help get this particular SSD working.

So took out the original HDD from my laptop and tested with the HDD holder - and it was being recognized! So the problem is with the SSD - but not able to return it now because there is no option to return it!!!!!!!!! Help !!!!!!!!!!Amazon told me that manufacturer would be able to help. Called WD and they did an RMA process for me since there is a 3 yr warranty on the SSD. Had to drop off the bad drive at their local center - they tested and confirmed it was bad. A replacement will be mailed to me in a week or so - but it will be a refurbished drive and not a new one!!!!!!!!!!!! Hoping that the replacement comes in working condition.A bitter experience overall - paying retail price to finally get a used drive!!! Thanks Amazon! -  for tossing me over to the manufacturer.Update (20 Nov 18)WD sent me a replacement, which looks like a new drive (not refurbished, as I was told by their support team). I cloned my HDD and installed it. laptop working much faster now. I am upgrading the review to a 4 star from a 1 star because of my experience dealing with WD. Despite the early pain, the whole WD replacement experience was rather smooth - I want to show my appreciation for this.\n', '\n  I came within a whisker of spending £600 on rebuilding my 7 year old self built PC as it was becoming increasingly, painfully slow. After testing everything I could with free tools it seemed most likely to be that both HDD’s were beginning to fail. So I thought I’d try a SATA SSD first, on the basis that if that didn’t fix it I could at least re-use it as a second drive if I then went ahead with a new board, memory, CPU and m.2 SSD.In the event it’s worked a treat. My PC now boots up to windows login in about 20 seconds and applications like outlook, excel, browsers, open up more or less instantaneously. I’d have been happy with that result from the £600 spend and doubt I’d have even noticed anything quicker. The only games I still play are ancient and undemanding, so unless something else wears out I’d hope to have the effect of a new pc for maybe another 2 or 3 years by which time everything I’d have bought today will be cheap as chips.As for the SSD itself, I’m afraid I can’t really tell you anything useful that would help differentiate between this one and another one. I’ve used WD forever and it’s creditable that the HDD drives this has replaced were 7 and 18 years old respectively.Fitting it was of course a doddle, if you can replace a fuse you can replace a hard drive, just remember to check whether you need a 2.5 to 3.5 inch bracket to mount it in the case as older cases often don’t have 2.5 inch drive bays.\n', '\n  ASUSのノートパソコンのHDD換装に使いました。OSはWindows10です。先に蓋をあけてWDの500Gが入っていたのを確認しましたので、同一のメーカーにしました。使い慣れたEaseUS Todo Backup（Free)で軽い気持ちで”クローン”作成にしましたが、思わぬところに落とし穴がありました。開始してからどうも不安になり一旦キャンセルしてネットで調べたところ「MBRが正常に出来ていないと失敗する」ようで、よく見るとこちらのSSDは新しいタイプのパーティション""GPT”になっていました。これを”MBR”にしないといけないのでひと手間かかりました。今回は親切な方の解説入りのクローンの仕方を読めたので、助かりましたが購入する前の情報にはこの点の記載は無く、注意が必要と思います。他社の製品がどちらのフォーマットになっているのかもわかりませんでした。古くからのWindowsユーザーですが新しい製品には疎いのでこんな落とし穴にも気づかないものですね。まだ交換して間もないので性能についてのレビューはありません。\n', '\n  Mi conclusión sobre cuál SSD elegir es simple, de las marcas y productos Samsung 860 EVO, Western Digital Blue 3D NAND, Sandisk Ultra 3D y Crucial MX500 compra el más barato. Yo sé que existen otras marcas pero esas son las que considero mejores para montar el sistema operativo, utilizar como almacenamiento auxiliar (recomendado para juegos) y almacenamiento externo (que no recomiendo tanto). En mi opinión la mejor marca, la que tiene el mejor soporte, las mayores velocidades, el mejor controlador y el mejor software es Samsung, es el rey. Aun así, compré este WD Blue de 1 TB con la intensión de utilizarlo en una PS4 y consolas de versiones posteriores. Me ha dejado satisfecho en cuanto a rendimiento y precio.Al principio, me preocupaba mucho por el desempeño (velocidades) del SSD. Me di cuenta de que los SSD que mencioné antes son similares entre sí y su funcionamiento es casi imperceptible. Mi sugerencia es comprar el que tenga el mejor precio y que se ajuste a tus necesidades.\n']"

I tried 2 different versions of the Samsung copy program. They both appeared to run the copy. Than I replaced the old C drive with the SSD and no Windows 10. Initially went to the Samsung site listed with the drive. It did not have any downloads for the 870 SSD. I searched and found another Samsung site that did have a copy version specifically for the 870 SSD. Neither worked. Finally used Acronis. It took half the time and made the copy with no problem.\n', '\n  I have a Lenovo AIO PC that came with a 500 gigabyte 3.5"" hard drive which seemed to be slowing the system down as the computer got older and the Windows 10 updates kept coming.  Since I have installed very little software myself I purchased the 256 gigabyte drive as step 1 in making it faster. Step 2 will be upgrading the DRAM which is on the way.Cloning the existing drive with provided software (a link for free cloning software is included) was very easy and took about 11 minutes. I removed the old drive, mounted the new SSD with gorilla tape and reassembled the unit.Boot up now takes about 1/4th the time, most of that being POST and is much quieter than before. Since I had no way to mount the SSD I used a loop made from gorilla tape and placed the SSD where the old HDD used to live. I may use velcro tape at a later date. Using Samsung Magician (also free, link provided) software I can see the read/write times are much faster than before.Over all, I highly recommend this drive as a replacement for a slow, aging HDD.\n', '\n  After researching and reading many reviews, I knew this was the SSD I needed. My old hard drive died right after I ordered this (conveniently) and am very impressed by the performance. Read and write speeds are insane and the space it saves in the case is welcomed.

Highly suggested to anyone looking for an upgrade.\n', ""\n  This is ~5th Samsung SSD installation over the past 5 years. All have been really straightforward installations.  Assuming you've already verified that this disk fits in your laptop via Amazon's or going to the Samsung's website or going to your laptop's HP/Dell/Lenovo website and look at the size and SATA interface type (or their offering for replacing your disk). YouTube is GREAT for finding out how to open up your laptop. Before buying the disk, I recommend that you watch the installation video FIRST to make sure it is within your skillset and toolset. The scary ones are the ones that require you to pry the shell open and I always worry that I'll break the tabs off or that I'm pushing when I should be pulling.  Anyway, besides the worry, all my installations have gone well. The migration software is pretty simple.  I use a USB-SATA cable (~8) to hook up the new drive. You choose the old drive, you choose the new drive, then hit GO.  All in all, I highly recommend the Samsung SSDs.  Make sure you install the Magician software. I really don't do much with it other than check the performance. These are solid disks with expected speed and longevity and ease of installation.  I have NO negative issues with it.  Oh, last minute reminder; test your old disk's speed before replacing it.  Stopwatch how long it takes to get to the first logo, time to get to the windows desktop and (somewhat subjectively) time to get an app (like a browser) to paint it's opening page.  The opening page times changed from 2 mins 10 secs to 41 secs.

The next window allows you to assign a Volume Label (drive name).  I called mine 1TB SSD. Click NEXT.  A new window will show you what is about to happen, click FINISH.In a few moments, the formatting of the new drive will be complete.  Open Windows Explorer, your new drive should show up.Now you can run the Samsung Data Migration software if you are swapping out your primary drive.  This will detect the original drive, and the new SSD drive.  If you need to pick a different drive to copy, the menu makes it easy.  When ready, run the transfer.  Mine took about 20 minutes.  It then prompted me to shutdown the computer, remove the C drive, and put the SSD in its place.  After that was done, I booted the machine and it started just like nothing had changed.  The speed improved, and all my programs are working.  I kept the older drive as an archive if this one fails.Hopefully these details will save you a few frustrating hours of getting the new drive to work.  It definitely wasn\'t a plug & play operation, but ultimately was worth the trouble.  Took a star off because of the effort to install it.\n', ""\n  It used to be that adding RAM was the easiest and cheapest way to speed up a slow computer.  That never addressed the real bottleneck of a computer, which is the hard drive.  I had a customer complaining that they probably needed a new computer even though theirs was only a little over a year old.  Knowing that they had a standard platter-style hard drive, I suggested this.  Boy is she glad that I did!  Saved her hundreds of dollars on a new computer and likely thousands on lost time waiting for her computer to 'compute' as her entire business relies on her computer to make her money.\n"", ""\n  I have a nearly 9 year old CyberPower desktop with an Asus P6T Motherboard and wanted to eliminate a potential point of failure to eek out a little more longevity.  And if I got some enhanced performance, all the better.  Turns out it was a very good move.Of course the order came within the two day Prime window which one expects from Amazon.  I also got the Corsair Dual SSD Mounting Bracketthat was an order option for another 6 bucks.  I reviewed it separately but it's a must have if you are installing into a 5 1/2 inch bay like I was.  The SSD comes with an Installation Guide, which I didn't need other than to follow a web site link provided in order to install the Samsung Data Migration Software and Samsung Magician Software.  Since I was installing the SSD to replace my C System drive, I needed to clone that drive onto the SSD.  And the Data Migrations software works perfectly. After formatting the SSD (NTSF),  I cloned 232GB to the SSD in just 31 min with a SATA 3.0 to SATA 3.0 connection.  It would have been much faster has my PC supported SATA 6.0.  Then removed the HDD and installed the SSD into the mounting bracket, connected the SSD to the SATA data cable and power cable (I used the same port as the C drive HDD was connected to), powered the PC up and it booted hassle free, with no issues.  It was indeed a perfect clone of the previous drive.  There was no issues that required going into the BIOS screen.  This will only be an issue if you do not use the same exact SATA data connection that was attached to your former C system drive.I'm amazed how much faster the drive is.  The Magician software not only carves out a bit of the drive for overhead, but it also has a cool performance test you can run on all installed drives.  So I ran it on the SSD and a 6 TB WD HDD dedicated to pictures and the Random IOPS results were:  for the SSD 8,789 read and 19,775 write vs for the HDD 178 read and 244 write.  While that may sound unbelievable, it isn't.  You actually experience this speed differential while working on the PC.This was definitely $150 well spent!\n"", ""\n  I bought this SSD and after 4 months it has bad sectors.  I can not use Samsung Magician to fix it so I resorted to Warranty with Samsung.  When I entered all my info (double verified), I'm told my product is past warranty coverage.

I use velcro tape to attach the drive to the back of the monitor for a cleaner setup.Boot up time went from 1:15 to 0:35 -- more than twice as fast.This is by far the cheapest and easiest upgrade you can get for any computer!\n"", ""\n  The back-up feature on this device doesn't work.  Hours wasted trying to get it to work properly.  Waste of money  - has to be returned but because it was delivered in May, Amazon won't allow us to return it.  We often purchase external hard drives to have on hand for when needed.  If you do this - open and check them right away.  If they don't work, you may not be able to return them if you've had them for a while, even unopened.\n"", '\n  I have the little-brother to this drive, a 500GB T3 and have been very happy with it over the last 2 years but the size is getting a little restrictive. This one is even faster and has twice the space.Physically the drive is very compact - a little shorter an slightly wider than a credit card and about 1/4"" thick and very light. The exterior is unassuming flat black aluminum and one end has a USB-C port and a small blue activity light.It comes pre-formatted in exFAT which works on both Windows and Mac. The box also includes a fairly stiff USB-C to USB-C cable and a USB-C to USB-A cable, each about 12"" long. The drive includes a software password tool if you want to password protect the drive contents (I didn\'t install this) for Mac, Windows, and Android.Other than the size and durability (no moving parts), the main benefit of these drives are speed. They are incredibly fast owing to USB 3.1 interface. I did a quick, informal test and 25Gb of video transferred in under a minute from my Mac Book Pro (USB-C); reading it back took about the same time. This is fast enough to use as regular storage and a huge time saver if you need to move large files between computers.The drive does get a tad warm under use and the cable is stiff enough to prevent the lightweight drive from laying flat on a desk during use, but these are minor quibbles.\n', ""\n  Even though I knew the size and read the comments, it's still such a surprise when you see how small this SSD really is. Amazing transfer speeds and it looks great too. The Samsung encryption software was problematic on Mac OS High Sierra (10.13.6) and clunky looking – so shortly installation I formatted the drive and opted not to use it.\n"", '\n  My 2nd Samsung SSD. Very happy with first purchase. This unit, however, comes with a little app which includes ability to password protect contents. Didn’t need this so installed drive without password lock. Transferred a decade’s worth of photos. Weeks go by without incident. Then, to my horror, I was locked out. Apparently, this is not a “one-off” incident. Moreover, only solution is for Samsung to wipe the drive. 😱Samsung support staff seem indifferent, “I see … please provide your password.” THAT’s the PROBLEM! I didn’t use one. So, photos lost, out a few $hundred and frustrated by poor product support.\n']"

Mine failed after a few months and SanDisk then told me this, after which they stopped responding to warranty questions. Fortunately, Amazon prorated the warranty on their behalf.\n"", '\n  Two out of six of these have corrupted and failed with all data lost. They were only used two weeks. Only written to once. Data was copied to them for storage. When I tried to read them they corrupted after reading them twice. The other four are still working fine and they are extremely fast but I can no longer trust that they will work even a month from now. Looking for another brand to copy the data to before the other four fail.\n', '\n  SanDisk is my preferred brand for my SDHC photo cards. When I heard they were making a solid state external drive I couldn\'t wait to get one. Although I only have a 3.0 (not a 3.1) USB connection, it still runs much faster than my other drives. After I bought the first one to use to back up thousands of photos and a ton of music I realized I needed a second one. So now I have two. They are quiet, cool (as opposed to running hot), and an easy size to handle. There is a rubber strip around the edge to help protect it if it falls - I do wish that it was wider. I also wish that is had rubber feet on one side as the skin  it slick so I have to be careful where I place them. Overall though, they work great and I will probably buy another one soon. Oh, and the USB cable is a little short at only 19"".\n', '\n  Used as a backup unit and to keep with me files while on the road, the device ""died"" 16 months after its purchase. To be noted that it has been in use on average 6-7 times per month for limited periods of time.Enjoyed the good performance of the 1.92TB unit, disliked since the very beginning the almost absent UI (a tiny, almost invisible LED light, always required quite some time to be seen by the system (mounting). Disappointing and disappointed. Stefano\n', '\n  Great performance but like others I am on my second unit here. Had frequent disconnections and intermittent data loss within 6 months of receiving my initial unit from Amazon. Thankfully SanDisk promptly shipped out a refurbished unit which is performing as expected. For this price, I (and others it seems) would expect better. Hard to recommend this given the many failures others have experienced as well, meaning this is not a one-off...\n', '\n  I’ve been a faithful user of Sandisk memory cards and thumbdrives for years, and will continue to be despite the failure of this drive and loss of all data.The drive was only used a few times, and kept in a protective case, yet within 4 months of purchase, the drive no longer mounts. The data loss is tragic, but a sobering reminder to make regular duplicate backups.This drive could’ve been the next best thing, but alas, it’s not.\n', ""\n  Exceeded my expectations.  I am a hobbyist photographer and have tens of thousands of photos that I edit and store on an external drive.  I was blown away at the speed and performance of this drive for my photos.  It's like working from an internal hard drive.  Instant response.  Wish I would have purchased this sooner.\n"", ""\n  Wow - just wow. Was debating this forever based on cost but I pulled the trigger. Really well built drive that's gorgeous. Wait, did I mention fast? Sorry - I didn't run a speed test but after copying 564GB of photos and video to it, when I launch Windows Explorer in Windows 10 - everything is instantaneous. It's just really fast. Love the fact that it's USB 3.1 C gen 2 - it works really well with my new Dell XPS 9550. I debated between this and the SSD T1 or T3 from Samsung but I read so many mixed reviews on those I went with this. So far so good. Pull the trigger!\n"", '\n  This SanDisk Extreme 900 Portable SSD is so far the best portable SSD I have ever used. It comes with two cables, one is USB 3 type A (the common one) to USB 3.1 type C, for users to connect it with a pc/mac without a type C port, and a USB type C to type C cable, to maximise its performance on a USB type C supported device.I bought the 1.92 TB version and the actual size is 1.74 TB on my Windows 10.For ATTO Disk Benchmark results and AS SSD Benchmark results please see the attached screenshots. Tested with Dell XPS 15 9550 (PM951) via USB 3.1 gen 2 type C cable.I am very satisfied with its real life speed: reading speed is about 670 MB/s and writing speed is about 500 MB/s.As the speed is very stable and super fast, I use it to keep all my raw photos and videos in one place, and do all the editing work as well.It is not cheap, but you can do much more with it than other portable hard drive just for backup purposes.\n', ""\n  UPDATE, 9 JULY 2020Well, what can I say?! VERY disappointed :-( ... Being always cautious, I am glad I ALWAYS made 3 backups, but I am cross with SanDisk, as I've trusted them, and unfortunately, paid a lot of money for their disk, in fact £500 :-( ... I always had good old Transcend drives as one of my backup external drives. Yes, it is NOT an SSD drive like SanDisk, but was 10 (ten) times cheaper and is still working fine after 7 (seven) years.SEPTEMBER 2016I've recently updated my iMac original hard drive to 500GB SSD drive and ... I was AMAZED what a difference was in a speed. Because of this huge difference in speed, I've decided to add another EXTERNAL hard drive in my collection of couple of Transcend hard drives, Seagate, and couple of WD hard drives. This time I went for this amazing 1.92TB SSD drive. It makes a HUGE difference to my other hard drives, and it will help me during working with Logic Pro and other music apps, as well as video and photography apps.I am using this drive directly plugged to my iMac, BUT ... also via RAVPower FileHub Plus,Wireless Travel Router, SD Card Reader USB Portable Hard Drive Companion, DLNA NAS Sharing Media Streamer 6000mAh External Battery Pack, to view my (ANY) documents on my iPad Air 2. I also can watch ANY movies I have on my hard drives and this SSD drive, during my frequent travelling.\n"", ""\n  I just got it and I've been running some tests on it, both on a Mac and a PC with Windows 10 and Thunderbolt 3.First impression is, it's a decent drive.The cable that came with it is pretty bad though... I had trouble connecting it in the mac, the Windows machine doesn't even recognise the drive with that cable. I have another C to C cable that I have used and that one works fine. But for a drive with this price the accessories should work flawlessly, instead they include just some cheap crappy cables that won't work in all instances.\n"", ""\n  I'm a photographer and graphic designer. I bought this SSD for my MacBook Pro (late 2016) and the laptop only has 256gb and I wanted a super fast SSD to have all of my work files within. Man!
