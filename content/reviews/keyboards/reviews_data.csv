I like the membrane keyboard because the stroke is reduced by about 85% which enables hitting the keys faster and reduces finger fatigue.

I can see myself using this for an extended period of time typing up papers and such.I only have 2 issues with this keyboard: the way it was packaged and the responsiveness of several keys. When I received the keyboard it arrived in no extra packaging, just the actual cardboard box for the keyboard with the shipping label attached. There really wasn't much in the way of padding inside either protecting the keyboard. This may have something to do with issue 2, which is that the 7 and 8 keys on the number keypad are only responsive about 50% of the time, usually after multiple presses as if they had to warm up. I don't use the number pad for a lot so this isn't a big issue, but it is an annoyance.\n"", '\n  I bought this model F-8294 fiodio keyboard believing that I could change the backlight color to solid red. As far as I can tell the rainbow backlight color is not configurable. But that aside it\'s a decent keyboard for the price. I prefer to use it for typing work because it\'s much quieter than my mechanical gaming keyboards. It\'s also thin and stands no more than 1 inch off my desk. By fiddling with the FN key, [brightness] key, and Page Up/Down keys, I can turn the backlight on/off, change the brightness, and enable/disable the ""breathing"" effect. Mine has a 9-second cycle.

The spacebar, shift, alt, and all the bigger keys make a really loud Clunk when coming back up from being pressed. This to me isn’t the biggest deal but might be for other people.

I am a college student and I enjoy typing on a mechanical keyboard. I have been using this Keyboard for around a week with my MacBook Pro.Once I opened the box I was enlightened by the weight of it. Its not too heavy and it's not too light. Seems like the right amount. The build quality is great at this price point. The plastic seems strong and sturdy. I did a flex test and little to no flexing. I haven't taken it apart but it feels like they have a metal plate inside for structural support and what gives this little guy that extra needed weight.The plastic for the key caps seem a little thin to me. When typing on the keyboard you can feel the quality of the caps. Slightly thicker keys would make this product perfect for me.The switches are great! I am no expert at all but from what I have read they compare to Cherry MX Blues. These switches are very loud. I live alone so I don't have to worry about disturbing anyone. This switches are of great quality in my opinion. They feels sturdy and they do not seem cheap.The led lights are great and it makes this keyboard look sexy. Each key has its own led and they are bright enough for everyday use. I do like how you can adjust the brightness of the light or you can just turn them off. I have noticed the LEDs will not stay at your setting once you turn your computer on. You will need to adjust it every time.Overall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this keyboard to anyone looking to save a few dollars.\n"", '\n  So I was hesitant to purchase this at first.I had read some review somewhere on another redragon product, claiming that it was not true mechanical switches, blah blah blah.I gotta say, this is probably one of the best keyboards I have owned so far.I don\'t usually spend a lot on keyboards with the exception of a Razer DeathStalker Ultimate that I had bought one day to use for work (and it worked out perfectly, it literally did like 30% of my job for me lol, but it was $300 so .. IT BETTER :D ).Back to the keyboard...I was how they say. FLUUSSSHH WITTHHH CASHHH.And thought what the hell I\'ll try one of their ""Mechanical"" keyboards, and if its a flop, then lesson learned...Once I had the box in my hand I was already impressed.The box it comes in is nice, and I can tell the product was heavy, which is usually a good sign.Once I pulled it out, I knew that it was meant to be (that\'s what she said...)It is pretty thick (doesn\'t bother me one bit)It is heavy, (also doesn\'t bother me).And because its heavy, it doesn\'t go sliding around the desk when I type at my nutty typing speeds.The build quality is excellent, honestly, I don\'t know how they are making money because this thing is solid, and I bet I can weaponize it..There is no bend or give to this thing, its literally like a rock, its a thing of beauty and brings a tear to my eye.The red glow is intense and clearly visible even under the high-intensity interrogation style lighting they use at my office.And the ominous red glow looks amazing, it fits my offensive IT role perfectly (I deal mostly in heartbreak, and ""Like A Boss"" situations)The flip tabs on the bottom are heavy duty, and are super solid, like crazy solid, you flip them back and they sound like someone cocking a gun.They literally SNAP! into place, I love it, I have been known to break these things off.. That is just not happening with this keyboard..I think I might just snap them back and forth now if someone comes to bother me in the middle of an intense keyboard bonding session.The keys themselves are beautifully designed, I love the font, it\'s not your typical boring look.This thing says I break all the rules,And its the type of font you want to send an email with, but know you can\'t because you will get fired when someone realizes that you\'ve gone beyond their realm of times of new roman, and into a whole new dimension of professionalism...They are crystal clear, no blemishes, and the glow comes through the keys perfectly, the glow underneath the keys makes it look that much cooler.The mechanical keys are solid and work exactly as you expect, whether the actuation force is exactly what it should be, I don\'t know.But they do the damn job, and I like to use my keyboards, not measure them in a full-on anal manner.The click is fairly loud and obvious, and there is no volume knob on it, so that is something to consider if you buy a mechanical keyboard for the office.I feel like this really does give me confidence in my high-speed typing ability as I am no longer wondering if I hit the key I wanted or if my keyboard had a derp moment (cause I don\'t make mistakes! YOU HEARD ME! {ok sometimes I do}).I really do blast through my typing though, with ease and a sense of accomplishment ( cause I feel accomplished when I hammer out a memo and it literally feels like I hammered it out... That is mission accomplished right there!)I am sure there are going to be moments when someone asks me questions whilst I am typing, and I am just going to keep slamming away while staring at them as I give them the look of ""I know what I am doing"", while confident clicking noises radiate from the dominion that is my office.My boss came in and just immediately went wow mode on it, he loves it and stated that it makes him want to get rid of his laptop and switch to a desktop just to have a badass keyboard like this one.I didn\'t mention that he could just hook it up to his laptop (MUAHAHAHA)And thus my reign over awesome keyboards stays unchallenged (as planned).Overall this thing is solid, and it makes a statement.It says, now mechanical keyboards can now be owned by anyone and not just those who are less impulsive with their money.I love it and I am going to buy 2 more, one for home (or should I call it my lair o.0) and one for my coming Mad (IT) Scientist Lab.To the manufacture: good job on an excellent product!I honestly didn\'t have confidence in your brand when I first made this purchase, I have never used your products but now I am a believer.And don\'t change the price, I am still a cheap impulsive bastard and will have to panhandle if you do.\n', ""\n  Lets keep this review short and simple, You want a mechanical Keyboard, you can't really afford a mechanical keyboard, but hey this one is only a few bucks more than a similar membrane keyboard? why not this one?Pros :It's cheap AF. seriously, $30? that's like 6 pumpkin spice lattes.It's actually mechanical, not like mechanical feel keyboards, you do actually get that sweet sweet clickity clack!Backlit! Not only is it mechanical it's actually backlit too! and it's not too bright, just right, easy to see even with the monitor right infront of it.Raised keys, a simple little touch, but makes the keyboard look that much better.Now onto the cons:There aren't that many cons really, at this price point it's bettery tactile wise than literally every keyboard out there, due to the fact it is an actual mechanical keyboard.But the only real Con that I can find is that it says the switches used are a Cherry Green Equivalent, but they're not. They're a Cherry MX Blue clone if even that, a real cherry MX Green has about 70grams of actuation force, this keyboard has 55grams. I measured using quarters, it took 10 quarters to make the switch depress. But more on these switches, they say that they're Greetech switches, however I can't find the same or similar switches anywhere online! These switches might be a knock off of a knock off.....but lets be honest, it's a $40 mechanical keyboard. that's actually mechanical. The only thing that would make this better, would be, slightly larger keys, I don't have little child hands. and possibly a wrist rest, but honestly? This keyboard is an incredible value and I would highly recommend it!\n"", ""\n  The only downside would be this is not actually Cherry, it's cherry-like. But after I got this product, all concern is gone.They did a great job making this switch. 100% satisfied.Revised) I've used this keyboard less than 4 months now, and one of the keys (D Key) isn't working properly.Considering all I do with this keyboard is playing PC Game (mostly PUBG) and very minor typing for my assignments, I'm very doubtful about the durability of this product. Other keys work fine, but D key doesn't function correctly. Two examples of symptoms; 1. When I press D ten times, sometimes only about 6~7 strokes are recognized. 2. I press D once, it types D twice. VERY FRUSTRATING.I thought this keyboard is BEST for price-performance but what good it is when it cannot do its job properly?\n"", ""\n  Edit, revised review at bottom. Dropped from 5 to 1 star. --Short key board, 87 keys, red light version review here.First off, it does have actual, working N-key rollover direct over USB(Which when I bought my last mechanical back in 2013 or so, it was ONLY available with the USB to PS/2 adapter) which is great, since many newer mobo's do not come with a ps/2 anymore (And why would they at this point) - Edit oct 2019 - it does NOT have 'true' n-key rollover. Certain games (In particular skyrim, fallout 3/4, new vegas, 76 - all on same engine) when your running forward (W key) the A and/or D keys fail to respond in some situations. For the longest time I assumed it was an issue with the game engine, but when testing with other games it happens there as well (I only recently tested in gta online because I often use my old 104 keyboard for that due to the need for a num-keypad. It happens there as well, and in far cry 4 and 5.) What I believe is the problem is it is not true ps/2 connection and has to simulate a proper n-key which works when your not activily pressing/releasing/holding/ multiple keys in random combos. (After a few it just seems to disable the A,S,D keys until you release the W key along with all other keys in that left side)The keys all feel very solid (very little key wobble, IE-side to side) and the tactile feedback is excellent.The Lighting is meh.. its either solid on or 'breathing' effect (or off) and u cannot dim/adjust the level at all. Very minor issue with everything else you get. Could have also used a USB pass though (Again, minor issue)For the price its a 5 star deal easily. Even if it was 2x the price it would be a good deal.(Will add/edit review once I used keyboard for a few months)Revised: After 2 months I have found it is NOT n-key anymore (I do not know what changed, but its not true n-key rollover at this time)The A key in particular is superseeded by any other key except Q and Z (As in if your holding the A key, no other key except Q or Z will register) - but if your using any other key THEN press A, it will register. Disappointed because at first it was a great board to use, but something within has changed (its not software related, and the keys DO still all work, just that its no longer a true N-key rollover board anymore = See above more recent 'review' a paragraph above.)\n"", '\n  A Redragon mechanical keyboard for so cheap. You might want to buy this product instantly, but I think I can change your mind.Hello, I\'m a 13-year-old boy writing this from my dad\'s Amazon account. 10 months ago I bought this keyboard as I wanted a mechanical keyboard but didn\'t want to spend a fortune. I bought the Reddragon k552 and at first sight, I loved this keyboard. It made me type much faster, I could type 100 wpm with this keyboard and all my friends complimented me for the loud switches and having a mechanical keyboard.Then, everything changed. The keyboard started having glitches, I would try everything to fix the glitches but nothing would work. Keys would sometimes respond, sometimes respond with a delay and sometimes not respond at all. A keyboard that guaranteed 50 million keystrokes per switch, couldn\'t even handle 20 million.Now, you might think that I probably did something wrong on my end, maybe bash the keyboard, throw it across the room or even spill water on it. But, I did nothing like that. I took very good care of the keyboard, I always made sure I wouldn\'t mash the keys or damage something, and I took extra precautions while I had drinks on my table. After all of these precautions that I took, the keyboard still broke.Now, you may be thinking, maybe I got unlucky and got a damaged one or a faulty piece but this is not the case. This keyboard has problems, a lot of problems. You check the 5-star reviews, make sure to check the 1-star reviews as well. I\'m not the first person to have glitches or a broken keyboard, multiple people have had them as well.You may say that the good reviews beat the bad ones but let me tell you something, kids buy this keyboard, there all happy and excited and love to play with it. They then tell their parents and the parents of the kids write good reviews and give the keyboard 5 stars. Then, when the keyboard doesn\'t work the parents don\'t write the bad reviews or complain because writing a negative review is much harder than writing a positive one.The k552 is a mechanical keyboard cheaper than any other decent mechanical keyboard you can find, but what good is a cheap item that won\'t work after a short period of time. Say there are 2 4k TVs, one of them is $1000 while the other is about $550. What good is the $550 tv when it will break much faster and you will end up spending more money.But maybe I\'m wrong, I should contact support and they will give me a new keyboard, right? Wrong, Reddragon support is the equivalent of emailing someone who\'s passed away. They just won\'t respond. It\'s like they don\'t care, they just have a ""contact us"" page because everyone else has one too but they didn\'t actually think about helping their customers.This keyboard is much cheaper than any other keyboard but it\'s not worth it, spend a little bit more on a mechanical keyboard and you won\'t run into problems or have to write a critical review.I hope I saved you some hassle and changed your mind on why not to buy the Reddragon k552.\n', '\n  With great reviews on YouTube and everyone talking about this keyboard, I hastily bought it cause it is my first mechanical keyboard and I was over joyed. It offered great switches and build quality for a low price which was its selling point but one grave mistake led me to write this review, I forgot to check the reviews on Amazon and noticed a lot of people have the double or even triple entry for a single key problem and sometimes unable to use it at all which I am facing right now. It was a great keyboard while it worked with great feeling and being compact too which added to the overall gaming feel but after some months of usage I noticed the double entry problem and looked up on the internet for answers but it seemed like most people were facing the same problem as me so, I looked and noticed some forums about keeping the keys dust free as it will hinder the mechanism so, cleaned it really well but it made no difference after a week of use as the same problem arose. I cleaned it once more and the problem still arose and now I am stuck with a useless keyboard who’s wasd and some other keys don’t work at all which is the biggest problem since I can’t play at all. So, my suggestion would be to get the Logitech G413 keyboard which cost around 5500 with discount and uses the same keys as it’s higher expensive models but cut down in certain area to reduce the cost. My suggestion is to please read the reviews on Amazon as it is the place which will give a glimpse on how this keyboard is while other places does not offer at all. I am not certain if everyone has the problem or only a select few such as me who is unlucky but it hasn’t worked well for me considering after investing almost 5k and it didn’t last more than 6 months.\n', '\n  Impressed with this product,In terms of Backlight Effects -It is single backlight but has few animated effects built in and few game presets/preference built in which you can activate for those games.Macanical Experience -This is first time I have baught macanical keyboard and no idea how it feels for cherry switch but for me this one has nice clucky feedback and sound is nice clucky and sharp.Overall I am very much happy with this keyboard, it is exactly the way seller has described.Thank you\n']"

So, the brightness key controls the brightness of the LEDs, and the pulse key controls the rate at which the LEDs pulse. You have three preset LEDs to go through, and that's all you have. The only other customization features, are setting brightness, and you have a pulse option. It doesn't have any software to go along with it, and I haven't been able to find any online.

I guess the original design it had turned out to be bad I suppose because I don't see it on amazon anymore. I still like to leave the review as it is, but I'll add few points here in my experience with the original product I have right now:Basically, its still in good condition. Quite durable too whenever I press the buttons hard. My left hand already used to its size so I don't feel the slight crap or pain like before. However, over the year or so I come to realize one thing I don't like about the product: The space bar.Yes, the space bar I mention below in my previous comment and said its unique? It turns out to be not so unique. Kind of bad imo as a design so it could be the reason why its not on amazon anymore. What's bad about the space bar has to do with its response and feel when using it. Some times in games, it doesn't always respond fast enough like it has a delay to it. Some times, I have to push the bar down hard to actually get the result I wanted in game which is too much work with my thumb that starts to crap some time.Overall, it's okay product since it still works. I just think the space bar design should've been something simple like this product in the picture. Oh well, that's all I like to share!___________This is the first time I purchased and use this gaming keyboard. I seen it around before in Fry's electronic but thought I didn't need it until later on I got a new laptop. The reason is I need a gaming keyboard is because I didn't want to abuse the laptop key letters (mainly the ASWD and space bar etc) so often to the point it would lose its durability sooner than later.So I went for this gaming keyboard. And now I want to share some thoughts about it.What I like about this product:It looks awesome. I like the design behind it as well as this interesting placement with the space bar. It's got LED lights and doesn't really require to download a driver since it simply operates just fine like a regular keyboard once you plug in the USB. (But just in case, read the instruction...)Now what I don't like about this product:This keyboard is rather...big. Maybe too big for my hand to the point I start to feel ache on my wrist and thumb. This is due to that unique space bar placement I mention. I mean it's good in some way just because it's different. However, if anyone with a same size as my hand have trouble with it, then it could be a problem.Then again, I gotten use to playing my left hand on the laptop keyboard since the gaps between the keybinds i click are very short so I'm willing to give this product a chance for a bit longer.Overall result:I give it 4/5! However, I do want to give reminder to gamers with small hands: Please be sure to check the measurement size of the keyboard to ensure you don't strain your hand too much.\n"", '\n  I rarely write really bad reviews but this particular product and seller irks me the wrong way. Let me get this eye brow raising bit out of the way first: Under Amazon\'s My Account/Your Orders, this particular product out of hundreds of other products I have purchased is missing "" Leave Seller Feedback"" and "" Write a Product Review""...among others. I WONDER WHY?Let\'s talk about the actual keyboard that I purchased for ~$17.00 on August 25, 2018. The date today is October 13, 2018 and already the ENTER Key and the Left SHIFT Key have failed. Meaning, pressing those keys will NOT preform a desired action, ever. It was a gradual but quick failure ( 2 days). Ohh, It\'s a pretty looking Keyboard but underneath the skin it\'s full of nasty surprises.The last time I checked, the entire premise of buying a KEYboard is when you press a KEY, it will preform a action. That is its primary function. Really, other than slight ergonomics and how they (KEYS) \'feel\', NOTHING else really matters!In the matter of less than Two Months, 2 of the most essential keys required have already failed!I am not the first or last person to complain about this.

If I am going to spend the better part of 8 hours staring at a computer, I might as well make it my own.  So I dropped a couple of bucks and got a keyboard and mouse that would be complete overkill for an office environment... and it's perfect.  Why?  Because now my boring ol' office has some uniqueness to it, making me forget I am trapped at a desk.  Now I am trapped at a desk with peripherals that are much better than anyone else.  This may not be a big deal to you, but in my mind, it's better to do the mundane tasks on a keyboard that visually distracts me with colorful bliss.  The mouse takes the feeling of dread I had from clicking that worn out stock mouse and gives me the excitement I need to not only click, but DOUBLE CLICK as well.  I'm sure i could play games and other things with it too.So why did I buy a gaming mouse and keyboard for an office computer?  Because I'm awesome.  That, and think about it... gamers sit there for hours double-clicking to use the Sword of Gondor repeatedly, so it must be comfortable.  Logic.\n"", '\n  I was looking for a keyboard/mouse set to play some games on my PS4 (trying to get used to it before getting a PC) and this set is exactly what I wanted. It works flawlessly, all I had to do was plug it in. No adaptor, no extra USB hub... nothing. It works GREAT right out of the box!It’s also really cool looking; the mouse has a fabric wire which is really nice to have, and both cords are very long. I really love this set and I’m really happy with my purchase! Awesome stuff.\n', '\n  I bought this combination, expecting it to work out of the box. The Keyboard is beautiful and does a fine job of working for what I intend it for. The mouse... No spring back for either left or right mouse buttons. I am a little more than peeved at seeing this obvious factory issue make it all the way to my doorstep. Still mulling over what to do - I may send this back. Poor quality control.Update: On closer inspection, the mouse had been misaligned at the factory and the top and bottom pieces of the mouse body were not aligned correctly. I watched a video on YouTube for this mouse as to how to disassemble and reassemble the mouse and after a few minutes I had the mouse repaired. I *WILL* be covering this on my YouTube channel since I plan to review this combo set.One more item: Redragon makes it VERY clear that software is included with this package. It is most certainly NOT. And they go to great lengths to hide the software from the end user. I have found what I believe to be the software links, but plan to test before I share them here. I will bump up the review one notch if the package works out well over the long haul, but given the mouse issue right out of the gate and the promised software NOT being in the box plus the poor web site support to find the program, I cannot reasonably give Redragon a 5 star rating until these items are corrected.Update: December 2019 - I was able to correct all the issues with that first mouse and the software works just fine. I\'ve since bought this combination of mouse and keyboard 3 more times and had no issues. This truly is a great keyboard/mouse combination and I\'ve made it a standard setup on the 3 gaming systems I\'ve built to date.  Software is indeed on their website but it is a little strange to find - The mouse is on the website as ""Redragon M601-3 CENTROPHORUS 3200 DPI Gaming Mouse "" and has two downloadable executables - The Windows 10 version works just fine. I rarely run the software since it works fine without it but it is nice to be able to change the mouse parameters if needed.\n', ""\n  I bought this for my kid so I wasn't too concerned about what I thought about it for a low cost keyboard and mouse combo. They just wanted the lights. But after using it myself on their system, I have to say the mouse and keyboard actually feel and work really really good!  And the LEDs actually look really good on both of them too! They beat up both a lot and still work after 4 plus months with no issues.While I am still planning to replace my workhorse basic keyboard with a programmable RGB like the Corsair K70 RGB or something by G.Skill or Logitech; if you are looking for a great budget combo with lights. This ones feels great to type on and looks great too for the price. I really am shocked. If you are building a new system and want to space out spending money on the really nice gaming keyboards, or refreshing the experience on and old system with worn keyboard, this is a great option. I didn't test for ghosting, but I didn't have any issues with any games or software.\n"", ""\n  My son wasn't enjoying my old 2005 logitech wireless and keyboard with his gaming so we grabbed this deal. So far we are all happy, the mouse is accurate and has a nice feel. The keyboard looks great with the backlit colors, which can pulse, scroll, and be dimmed and brightened. The keys have a bit softer of a feel than I am used to but it hasn't hindered me in any way. For this price we couldn't be happier, we very much recommend this.\n"", ""\n  I just got this product, after it was delayed for a day.The mouse works great but the keyboard came defective, I will have to return it, because several keys (W, H, ., backspace, delete) don't work.I tried changing the usb port but it did not work.\n"", ""\n  I've only been using the keyboard at work for about week, and so far it's been great. I like that I can select a 'solid' color (vs multiple colors) and each day I change the color (Fn+Home) - I've received lots of comments on the cool colors. The keys are a perfect distance from each other & are easy to press. My old MS keyboard at home forces me to use more pressure on the keys & therefore I find I make more typos. I don't have that problem with this keyboard. The only thing I miss having is a button for the calculator.I like the mouse too. The only complaint is that sometimes my forefinger doesn't automatically find the scroll wheel (it's between two ridges that are slightly too high) & I have to look at the mouse to find it.\n"", ""\n  Bought this thing ages ago and had a ton of issues but never bothered to review it.

Why sell it as a package when they don\'t match?- Mouse does not have enough DPI setting.UPDATE:I have been using this keyboard and mouse for a few months nowIt is horrible.The mouse and keyboard.Both are mussy...the key board randomly goes into a mode where some of the characters are different.  For example.  If you want to type the ""@"" symbol (shift-2) it gives you a quote"".  i have to constantly reset the key board by unplugging it and re-plugging it in.Just horrible.Please same you money and buy another keyboard....anything but this crapAnother UPDATE:I switched out the keyboard and mouse with a cheaper INSIGNIA brand and it is much better in comparison.  Keys are not as mussy and that thing mentioned in previous update hasn\'t happened, so i know it\'s the keyboard.  What a waste of money....Just china unloading cheap crap only for consumers to throw away.  PLEASE GIVE REAL USEFUL REVIEWS...I am tired of throwing chinese crap in the garbage.\n', ""\n  I had seen some reviews about the bad quality of the keyboard. And the a lot of good reviews were particularly complimenting more the mouse than the keyboard, which made me skeptical about buying it, but I did. Now, there are 2 major issues and one minor issue.The keyboard turns off for 2 seconds whenever I'm writing at a faster pace, which is very bad when we're talking about a keyboard made for gaming. It also turns off for 2 seconds when i try to write the @ character (shift + '2' key pressed), and when it's back on it considers the Shift key always pressed, and only by pressing the shift key again does this stop.The minor issue is that in both the keyboard and the mouse the lights stay on despite the computer being turned off.\n"", '\n  Only problem- cannot get my son away from it!\n', ""\n  Visually this keyboard offers a lot, you can change the colours, if they strobe or not, i went with solid purple and while its not as bright as my last keyboard still I am happy.However that is where my happiness ends. My last keyboard felt like I was typing on clouds. Light and smooth with very little pressure needed. This keyboard feels like I'm hammering rocks with each keystroke. I have to push down so much harder and its a deal breaker. I'm going to get my old keyboard repaired and pawn this one off on my husband.As for the mouse, its very unappealing to me (visually and physically) I'm going to give it away. I much prefer my 5.00 LuguLake mouse I got 5 years ago.TLDR: if you don't mind pressing hard great keyboard. Mouse is ugly and I didn't like the way it felt in my hand. Good deal for the price.\n""]"

Take a look at the return button though... It's not in the right spot and an odd shape.  Backslash is totally in the wrong spot.

I can feel the difference in games with their super fast actuation. Typing is just the reverse though, I have a lot of typos with the super fast actuation. Which isn't a problem at all, because you can switch profiles on the fly and have one of the best typing experiences imaginable with super deep 3.6 mm actuation point. It's like having multiple keyboards at once, and being able to change them effortlessly to suit the task at hand.Some disadvantages I'd like to point out:- Not waterproof. Be careful with it.- Only the main block uses omnipoint switches. Not a big issue considering you don't really use the other keys, but that's a good reason to make a 60% or TKL Keyboard with only omnipoint switches, no? After using TKL keyboards I've really appreciate the extra space. I highly recommend the TKL version over the full one, once it actually releases.- O-rings will prevent the 3.6mm actuation point from working properly, and I really didn't like how O-rings felt on this keyboard. Not really an issue considering that the keyboard is already quite silent even without any O-rings.\n"", '\n  I have owned a Steelseries keyboard in the past and was greatly disappointed with the switches it used. I had a m750 with the qx2 switches, and they just felt off to me. Not really sure how to explain, but they just felt off. Im not generally a fan of linear switches ( as a gamer, blasphemy I know) as I tend to have a heavy hand and accidentally hold shift  or ctrl by accident, which messes up my movement and gets me killed. Not only that but I feel I mess up more when typing essays for college and have to go back to revise more frequently. I needed a new keyboard that would allow more space for my mouse, as I play on a low dpi, and was looking at TKL models from various companies. Originally I was planning on the G Pro from Logitech to go with my G Pro Wireless, but then I realized they had Romer-G switches. I tested them out and found them alright, but lack of customization and after market keycaps was a turn off for me. The new Apex Pro TKL came out with their OmniPoint switches, which are linear switches that you could change the actuation point of to fit your preference. Again, I am not a fan of linear, so this disappointed me as the rest of the keyboard caught my attention. Luckily with the Apex 7 they allow you to choose your switches out of the 3 options they provide. I chose the browns as I wanted something fast but with some feedback. When it arrived 2 days later, I was impressed with the size and beauty of it. The nicest keyboard I owned so far. The switches feel nice, and there are a few features you won’t find on a some other TKL keyboards like the OLED display (mostly a gimmick but cool nonetheless), usb passthrough, cable routing, and dial. The magnetic wrist rest isn’t plush, more like a flat rubber surface to prop up your hand. That isn’t to say it’s not comfortable or soft, but it is a pain to clean as it is a dust magnet. They keycaps feel cheap and are my main gripe for a premium keyboard, however I Luckily had higher quality shine-through keycaps from previously. Overall I am satisfied with the keyboard and would recommend to anyone thinking of purchasing.\n', ""\n  I'm the kind of guy that games 6hrs + a day in high elo multiplayer games and cares about games more than most things in my life.It's a keyboard. Information on good keyboards for gaming is ambiguous and prices are usually from 100-200 for mechanical keyboards. This one is definetly expensive.Keyboards don't affect gaming that much. Monitors, mice and tower hardware do. Flat laptop keyboards are better in my opinion because of how easy it is to slide to another key once you get used to them.That's why after switching to this keyboard I felt a little underwhelmed for its price. It's not a bad keyboard by any means. In fact, it's one of, if not the best, mechanical keyboards on the market. I just don't think the price tag justifies itself. Unless it lasts me ~10 years.In conclusion, I'l recommend it if you want to spend for the long term benefit. I'l keep it at 4* unless it breaks. If that is the case I'l update the review for you curious people.Sincerely,XD.\n"", '\n  Such a high quality built keyboard. I got the TKL version and its very compact.

Trae algunos errores en las leyendas de las teclas y que a este nivel de precio, no deberian de existir.Lo compre con switch cafe para supuestamente tener retroalimentacion tactil y los switches dejan mucho que desear, no hay consistencia al rededor del teclado, algunas teclas son mas tactiles que otras y la mayoria parecen switch rojo.El reposa muñecas es de plastico duro y delgado, solo para la foto, para que se vea bonito pero no cumple con su cometido, termine usando otro que tengo que si es comodo.La iluminacion de los leds es menos brillosa que los modelos Apex M750 y en mi opinion no vale la pena hacer el upgrade desde un m750 a este. Sino tienes teclado y estas buscando uno, yo buscaria otras marcas con mayores prestaciones, si de plano quieres este por la marca o porque esta bonito, es buena compra, solo que puede que despues de un rato empieces a notar los detalles o falta de calidad en algunos aspectos.\n', '\n  I ordered this as a replacement gaming keybiard to a logitech g910, its very chunky and the keys are really loud . That with the lack of a ten key makes this very expensive keybiard a real waste of money compared to competitors\n', ""\n  A great keyboard that had everything I wanted. Specifically, my main criteria:1) Floating keycaps2) Dedicated media keys3) Blue switchesThe software is decent and I love that I can program (most) things right on the keyboard itself. I don't find the OLED to be of much use except to program things, since none of the games I play have apps. I type a lot in addition to playing game more casually (MMOs where I stick mostly to PvE), so I can't say much for how it handles during more intense matches, but it's been very responsive and types nicely so far. It's not cherry switches, but I can't tell much of a difference between my Cherry board and this one.The keycaps are solidly 'meh', but I love that I can swap them out (including bottom row!) for other caps. I currently have the HyperX pudding caps on and they look great. The build quality is pretty great, and I especially love the aluminum board (it's matte so it doesn't attract fingerprints). The wrist rest is also a solid 'meh', since although they have a great matte rubber surface that doesn't show marks, they're not soft and they also aren't high enough to actually do anything. The magnet is a good strength, holds securely when I move the kb. The cable isn't removable (boo) but there's 3 points of exit so you can customize it a little.I took a star off for two things:1) If you don't have the feet down in the back, the wrist rest doesn't lie completely flat on your desk at the front. Every time I put down my hands, it thuds a bit, especially on the right side. If you have an extended mouse mat or some other more cushioned surface you won't have this issue.2) This is a more minor quibble, but one of the cable holders on the back had a corner that cracked. I think the cable was forced in too hard and broke it? It's not a big deal since it's on the back of the board and that particular holder still works fine, but for this price, having something that's broken right out of the box is pretty crappy.Overall, if you like what it offers, this is a great keyboard with great build quality and smooth typing.\n""]"

Everyone is different, I get it.  But I just don\'t see what device you can plug in on the LEFT side that would be convenient and useful on a ""gaming"" keyboard.  There\'s already an audiojack for headphones.2) It\'s not really that good of a keyboard for the price.  The keys are great, love the keys, but the overall look and feel of the board is lacking.  The design is VERY basic and does not offer that premium feel that should go along with the price.  Looks like a $40 off-brand keyboard.  Of course this is a personal taste, but just look at this keyboard next to the other $120+ mech keyboards on the market.  It\'s hard not to notice the difference.For all those reasons, I\'ll probably be returning this board and buying a more affordable one with the same functions (minus audiojack) and a USB passthrough I can actually use.

Nice.  I\'m definitely returning it now.  Ironically, now that it\'s down to $100, it\'s actually a pretty good value.

Before I got the BlackWidow Elite (Orange Switches), I never looked forward to using the keyboard -- That all changed once this bad boy arrived. It\'s by far the best computer keyboard I\'ve ever owned. Based on the quality of this thing, the BlackWidow Elite will probably be the last keyboard I\'ll ever buy.Pro:Look and feel -- The keyboard looks great, has a ""weight"" which speaks to its quality and of course, the ability to customize its lighting easily via Razer Synapse is nice. It also comes with a foam ""pleather"" wrist pad which feels very nice during my long typing sessions. It\'s connected to the keyboard via a magnet which is a nice touch.Performance -- Typing on the keyboard is a true joy. I don\'t like messing around with batteries and Bluetooth for my keyboard and mouse as there are just too many things that can go wrong at the wrong time. So, being plugged in directly to my computer, this thing is a workhorse. The mechanical keys pop and sound great. The Orange Switches are  It\'s flawless. It just works ""perfectly"".Mechanical Keys -- I went with the Orange Switches which are advertised as ""Tactile and Silent"". Previously I\'ve had the Green Switches and.... they were just a bit too noisy to use in an office setting. I\'m glad I made the choice. the Orange Keys are a perfect balance of performance, pop, and sound. Not silent, however, they are not overly loud either.Features -- There are many features and special keys on the keyboard however the one I use the most ""by far"" is the volume control, mute bottom, and media controls (Pause Music, next, back). It\'s in the perfect spot and allows me to easily adjust my volume. Love, love, love it!Cons:1 - The price (it\'s spendy)2 - Single USB port on the Keyboard. It would be nice if it has a 2nd USB port I could use. It\'s a simple solution to solve with a small USB hub but, as a minimalist, a few ports would avoid more clutter on my desk.3 - Must be connected to a computer using two USB ports.*Update 12/11/2020*Still going strong with this keyboard. After countless hours of use, it still looks and works as good as the day I bought it. Highly recommended, 5+ stars!\n', '\n  I have some experience with Razer Blackwidow Tournament Edition with green switches, but the clicky sound annoyed my wife, so I decided to buy this keyboard, because of its yellow silent switches and media keys.I like this keyboard, it looks very solid, durable, heavy a bit, but, I prefer interpret it as advantage. Back-light is perfect, I spent a lot of time enjoying it. Razer Synapse 3 is better than previous version, it is more user-friendly. I had some problems with delivery, but It is common problem for my country, keyboard was delivered from USA to Russia faster than from the UPC post office to me, but I think it is UPC problems ;)\n', '\n  Very good keyboard and i love the wrist restPros:-With some of the older razer keyboard i have had my main problem was with the wrist rest leather rubbing off or just stretching but with this keyboard the wrist rest is anazing-keys are really responsive with the linear switches i gotCons:-The software you need to use for the keyboard has problems where it doesnt recognize the keyboard so even tho you can type normally it wont load your lighting profile until you unplug it and plug it back in-The feet on the keyboard are quite brittle and for me they didnt last long-After a while the volume wheel started to act weird and when i was just watching videos or even playing a game it would turn the volume up or down on its own\n', '\n  If you were born in the early 80s and looking for a real mechanical keyboard, look no more! Also LEDs are individually addressable with a C++ sdk.\n', '\n  This is a great keyboard for everything. I would recommend it, but definitely choose either the linear & silent yellow switches or the tactile & silent orange switches. The green switches may sound cool for that clicky mechanical keyboard experience but you will get tired of it. My previously black widow V2 had them and they got annoying. The ""Silent"" switches are by no means silent, unless you\'re amazing at stopping your keystrokes before bottoming out. You will need to get used to linear switches as typing will feel weird at first.Pros- Good Quality- Key actuation feels good- Dedicated multimedia controls are so useful, especially the volume dial- New stabilizers on the keys are goodCons- Expensive, honestly wait for a sale- When you bottom out harder, there is a metal twang- For the price, the key caps should\'ve been doubleshot PBT (there is an upgrade kit but also expensive)- Non-standard bottom row means upgrading key caps are more difficult (Razer please make pudding key caps)\n', ""\n  This is by far the best keyboard I've touched my fingers upon.  It arrived quickly, it was very well packaged and presented.  Being a Razor junkie I know the ins and outs, but for those who're new to the cult of Razor pretty much every aspect of the keyboard can be modified, tweaked, or macro'd!  I mean, this keyboard is next level, if you're looking to up your game this is the right hardware for you!  Now that I've said what most people already know about Razor, the seller themselves carried out their end of the bargain flawlessly to a point.  One aspect they got wrong was the switches, I had ordered the yellow silent switches and they sent me the mechanical loud switches.  I don't mind, it's more tactile feedback.  I'm flexible enough to not have cared.  Those who might otherwise be upset about the difference I'd strongly recommend before digging into this treasure make sure you check the box to ensure you got the switches you ordered.\n"", '\n  Got this on sale. It’s great, orange switches are my favourite out of the 3. Good all around keyboard!\n']"
