I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 – 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 –8th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the “Saving Money on Purchases” section).This device is Amazon’s most recently refreshed (2019 – 9th generation) Fire tablet 7 inch at an outstanding price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is definitely slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are really tough to beat and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations.Below is my summary of the “Fire 7.” I have spent the past few days playing around with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review has overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience.-THE BOX: The Fire 7 tablet, a quick-start guide, basic safety instructions, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.- AVAILABILITY: Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage are the base colors variants. Additionally, covers can be purchased for $29.99 in the same color scheme as the Fire tablet from Amazon. Personally, I wouldn’t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other high quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better.- Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 model:--- Display size remains the same--- PPI remains the same at 171--- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM.--- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone)--- Size specifications remain the same--- Warranty remains the same (90-day limited warranty)- Summary of key aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017.---  Fire 2019: Increased storage options (16 GB or 32 GB) as compared to prior version Fire 2017 (8 GB or 16 GB).--- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from prior version.--- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019). This is a major plus because it would take forever to charge these tablets). Again, please note that this claim (regarding charging time) holds true only if an Amazon wall outlet is used. The tablet usually notifies you when you are using a non-compatible wall outlet and cable. I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging.--- The new processor based on specs provided by Amazon to developers Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 (1.3 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A7 (1.3 GHz)] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available.--- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version.--- Slight decrease in weight (0.3 oz/9 grams)--- Light sensor added (mentioned in developer information page).--- Three new colors added (Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage) in addition to Black.- Technical specs and other details:--- Size: 7.6” x 4.5” x 0.4” (192 x 115 x 9.6 mm).--- 171 pixel per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter. This basically means that there is a bright display with vivid colors and whiter whites for a great viewing experience from all angles.--- 7-inch screen, 1024 x 600 resolution with SD video playback--- Internal Storage: 16 or 32 GB--- External Storage: expandable storage using MicroSD card for up to 512 GB + unlimited cloud storage for Amazon digital content purchases.--- Weight: 10.1 oz/286 grams--- Amazon’s digital assistant: Hands-free Alexa enabled. This option basically converts the device into a stand-alone device that can do multiple functions. For instance, if you are cooking and want help, you can ask Alexa to pull up the instructions for “Mashed Potatoes” and it will do so.--- Warranty and Service: 90-day limited warranty and service included. U.S. customers can purchase an extended warranty for 1, 2 or 3 years (though I might not personally recommend this for such an affordable product like the Fire 7)--- Camera: 2MP VGA front-facing camera and rear-facing HD camera--- Sensors: Accelerometer and light sensor--- Battery life: Up to 7 hours of battery life--- Fully charges in 4 hours (if Amazon wall outlet is used)--- Single-antenna dual-band Wi-Fi. Uses 802.11a/b/g/n with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security using password authentication.  No support offered to connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) Wi-Fi networks.--- Bluetooth 4.1 LE--- Ports: USB 2.0 (micro-B connector) to connect to the computer or for charging the device with the included power adapter; MicroSDXC slot for external storage, and 3.5 mm stereo jack and integrated speaker.- Some limitations (to be expected because of this tablet being sold at a bargain price and also being the base model of the Fire series):--- No HD video viewing available--- Camera specs are sub-par as compared to other costlier tablets (again this might sound oxymoronic...but just pointing it out)--- Max volume is below average (because of the mono-speaker)--- Sound quality is average--- Amazon’s ecosystem is not as massive compared to the Google Play Store and Apple Play Store.--- Amazon’s Silk browser is not as intuitive and user-friendly as more prominent competitors (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.).--- Some reviewers have claimed that the external storage (MicroSDXC card) is not as responsive as the internal storage (this is not something I have experienced).--- Because of concerns dealing with volume and sound quality using this model for listening to music, or watching TV shows, movies, etc. might require headphones or a speaker.-Fire 7: 2019 Tablet Kids edition: Please note that Amazon has updated their Fire 7 Kids Edition too. Since, this is for a different audience, I will not deal with it in this review.- Comparison between Fire 7 (this version – 2019 release) and Fire HD 8 (2018 release – mid-tier model):--- Charge time: Fire HD 8 (6 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours)--- Display Size: Fire HD 8 (8 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches)--- Video playback: Fire HD 8 (HD video playback) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback)--- Resolution: Fire HD 8 (1280 * 800; 189 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI)--- RAM: Fire HD 8 (1.5 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM)--- Battery life: Fire HD 8 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours),--- Speaker: Fire HD 8 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker)--- Weight: Fire HD 8 (12.8 oz, 363 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g)--- Expandable Storage (internal storage remains same): Fire HD 8 (expandable by to 400 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB).--- Colors: Fire HD 8 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red, Canary Yellow) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage)--- Cost: Fire HD 8 (16 GB - $79.99; 32 GB - $109.99) vs. Fire HD 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99)--- Multi-touch: Fire HD 8 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)--- Processors, software version, and cameras remain the same on both units.- Comparison between Fire 7 (this version – 2019 release) and Fire HD 10 (2017 release – mid-tier model):--- Charge time: Fire HD 10 (5 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours)--- Display Size: Fire HD 10 (10.1 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches)--- Video playback: Fire HD 10 (HD video playback; 1080p HD resolution) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback)--- Resolution: Fire HD 10 (1920 * 1200; 224 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI)--- Processor: Fire HD 10 [2xARM Cortex-A72 (1.8 GHz), 2xARM Cortex-A53 (1.4 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 inch (ARM Cortex-A53 Quad-Core 1.3 GHz) (basically Fire HD 10 would be substantially faster than either the Fire 7 or Fire HD 8)--- RAM: Fire HD 10 (2 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM)--- Battery life: Fire HD 10 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours),--- Speaker: Fire HD 10 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker)--- Camera: Fire HD 10 (0.3 MP front-facing and 2 MP rear-facing camera) vs. Fire 7 (2 MP front-facing and rear-facing camera)--- Weight: Fire HD 10 (17.7 oz, 500 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g)--- Internal Storage: Fire HD 10 [32 GB (25.4 GB available to user) or 64 GB (54.1 GB available to user)] vs. Fire 7 [(internal storage remains same - 16 GB (9.4 GB available to user) or 32 GB (23.6 GB available to user)]--- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 10 (expandable by to 256 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB).--- Colors: Fire HD 10 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage)--- Cost: Fire HD 10 (32 GB - $149.99; 32 GB - $189.99) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99)--- Multi-touch: Fire HD 10 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)** If you are considering buying the Fire HD 10, I would wait on it as there is a high probability that this model will be refreshed this year as the last update was in 2017 (Amazon seems to follow a 2-year refresh cycle though this is not always the case).- Some useful features on Fire Tablets (not a comprehensive list)--- Accessibility: “VoiceView and Screen Magnifier enable access to the vast majority of Fire tablet features. VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.”--- Surfing the web using Amazon’s web browser - Silk--- Watching movies, TV shows and listening to music.--- Ability to read Kindle books.--- Ability to read the news using Washington Times--- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon’s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.--- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc.--- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store.- Testing:Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.- Saving money on purchasing the Fire:--- For users who want more storage, I would strongly recommend getting the Fire 7 (16 GB) and then purchasing a microSD card as opposed to getting the costlier Fire 7 (32 GB tablet). For context, users can get a 64 GB microSD card for around $12 (users might be able to get a cheaper microSD card on Amazon prime day) on Amazon which is cheaper than paying an additional $20 for Fire 7 32 GB. Additionally, the user gets more storage by getting a microSD card.--- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles the user to a ($10 app store credit value), so you are essentially paying $ 39.99 for the 16 GB Fire 7 tablet.--- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $49.99 (with special offers) or 32 GB Fire 7 for $69.99 (with special offers). Customers can disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Fire with special offers. Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 devices, all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the Fire with special offers and then remove the special offers..--- You can easily trade-in your prior Fire for Amazon credit (for $5-$15 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire.--- As previously mentioned, I would recommend avoiding purchasing extended warranty on this item.--- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.-Quality comment: Some customers have critiqued the prior version (Fire 7: 2017) for lack of long-term quality. Again, please remember that this product is sold for $49.99 and goes on sale for around $ 29.99. How much more can one expect for a product this affordable? I have used my prior Fire 7 (2015) for 4 years without any issues (Honestly, I am surprised it lasted this long). Additionally, it definitely is more durable than my iPad. Additionally, with the immense technological breakthroughs occurring at lightening speed, any tablet will be obsolete in a few years. So, it might be logically better to get an affordable average end tablet than investing in a high end one (unless you need a high-end one for your specific use).- Conclusion:To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, and potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, and basic app store.  Updates worth noting in this version include the new color options, a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and can complete most of the basic and some intermediate tasks along with basic entertainment, then this Fire tablet is the way to go. So, I am giving it 5/5 stars in spite of its limitations because it is really hard (if not impossible) to find a better deal at this price point.- UPDATE # 1 (June 10, 2019): Fire HD 8I would personally recommend the Fire HD 8 (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB vs. 1 GB), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the feature I appreciate the most - Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I own both the 7 and the 8 inch, and there is a spectacular difference in sound quality and volume between the two. Besides, most phones now have an average screen size of around 5.5 inches (many companies are moving towards a 6 inches average). So, having a 7-inch tablet might not per se make a major difference for customers because it is similar in size to their phone (unless they want to use this device as a back-up device to prevent wear and tear on their phone). Additionally, since charging takes a substantial amount of time, I would rather have a tablet with longer battery life (Fire HD 8) than shorter (Fire 7). However, please note that the last argument cuts both ways as the new Fire 7 (4 hours) charges quicker as compared to the Fire HD 8 (6 hours).- UPDATE # 2 (June 15, 2019): Amazon FreeTime Unlimited- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited ($2.99/month after free subscription period)--- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over “20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids' profiles to give them more access to apps and games.” “In FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.” Another unique feature is Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish!--- Parents also have the option “to set educational goals and curfews (using FreeTime Unlimited), and manage content for up to 4 child profiles (option given during initial set-up of the tablet) with easy-to-use parental controls.”--- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers unbeatable value – I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after trial subscription ends).*FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time.UPDATE # 3 (June 21, 2019):  Battery Life and SoftwareSome customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I have experienced occasional battery fluctuations (my prior Fire seemed to have better battery life). So, I am docking a star. Some other reviewers have also experienced overheating of this device. Other than the occasional overheating that occur in all devices (when complex programs/apps are used for an extended period of time), I haven’t experienced anything major until now. Additionally, some customers have also complained about the new Fire OS causing problems. I have experienced occasional staggering of the OS and app closures but nothing major as described by other reviewers. I will continue my testing to see if other issues surface but just wanted to give a heads-up to customers so they are prepared in case they experience any issues in the future and want to contact Amazon about it.Please also note several resources were used in the compilation of this review but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review. If you have any feedback or questions or corrections, leave a note in the comments section. Thank you!\n"", '\n  I having been buying the smaller Fire tablets (7 inch) since the beginning and I can now recommend to buy this tablet. I have other sized Fire tablets (8 Inch) and a new ipad, plus the new Kindle paper white, but the Fire 7 is my go to tablet. What I use it for. Prime Video, Hulu, Netflix, Youtube.  Kindle reader for books and bible. Audible books from audible. Podcasts (stitcher). Comixology for comics (old school Marvel fan!). Instagram (I do not use facebook). Home automation with Alexa (control of my lights, ring alarm, alarms, and basic questions) works great both hands free as well as pressing the home button.  I also play light games on it, Word search, Temple run, Angry Birds series of games, Yahtzee, Subway Surfer, Crossy Roads, and a few others.  I also listen to Amazon prime music (Apple music does not work on this device).  I mainly use my Apple air buds when watching and listening and it sounds fantastic.  Picture quality is great.  This is a snappy little tablet and my favorite size.  It feels good in the hand with the solid plastic build (compared to the Fire 8 inch, which feels more ""cheap""). It is a great tablet to use while lying in bed, which is mainly when I use it (ipad 9.7 is to heavy). I feel that Amazon finally got it right with this new 2019 version. The previous versions are painfully slow to load anything, and that is why I never would recommend them especially for a child.  These new tablets are so much better, my wife wants one, and I will be buying them for my kids, something I would not even consider before, because of the frustration of the slowness (and the reason my kids took over the ipad and iphones in the first place).  As you can see this is a consumption device, meant for fun..not a computer or workhorse.  I should mention you can check email and use the tablet for video chatting and dropping in on other echo devices which works really well and my kids have fun using it, I should also mention that I am a Prime member and take advantage of the Prime photo storage, which any picture that I take on my iphone, pops up on my Fire Tablet. I should also mention why I use this for reading more than my paper white, it is because I like the ""page curl effect"" and the way it highlights my passages on books (I still use my paper white..but this is just a preference). The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the 2mp camera (which I do not use much) and the battery life, which is actually not bad, but Amazon asked for a ""star"" rating on those two features as well as tablet as a whole.  At $50 you can not go wrong. Plus if you have a previous version, just trade it in. I got $10 knocked off and an additional 20% savings. I think I paid about $33.  I will be trading in my 8 inch Fire for this size as well.  Great little tablet!\n', ""\n  This kindle worked well for a few hours and then all of a sudden it started to search the internet on it's own.  This is for my 8 year old daughter because her old kindle was not working.  This kindle really scared my child.  She would play a game and something would control the game.  We would watch it change the settings on it's own and move from ap to ap.  When the kindle was locked something kept trying to access my contacts, and unlock my kindle!!  It would change the time and change to a different alarm.  I contacted amazon and they were not helpful, because nothing worked..  I had to factory restart it twice and it kept going back to controling itself on it's own.  Finally I just had to return it because it because there was no way to use it.  Amazon needs to make a product that works.\n"", '\n  Good budget tablet but the battery drains continuously when idle at a fast rate (10% daily)\n', ""\n  I'm not a fan. It doesn't hold an internet connection well AT ALL and I hate how limited the device is. I'm sure it's mostly my fault for not reading that the fire tablets are only exclusive to Amazon apps so you can't use any apps from Google play or anything, but in the part of the description I read it said games. I didn't realize it didn't include Google play games. Unfortunately that was my reason for getting a tablet, so I will be returning mine and getting something with Google play services. If you are okay with only watching movies, TV and reading, this may be okay for you. Not sure about the internet connection though, my boyfriend's tablet (Lenovo) doesn't do that.\n""]"

You can either adjust it manually in the setting section or just set it to automatically active with sunrise and sunset. I just put in an automatic timer and overall found it a pleasure to use this feature at night. The warm effect doesn’t bring in any eye irritation to me, at night or day, which a computer screen does.•  Surprisingly for me, I found the need to apply the warm temperature display on all day. The reason why is because the effect creates the illusion of flipping through old pages in a book. I’m always a physical book person, so this feature brings in the comfort of that feeling.  It makes it look like real paper! Still, I only use the cool display when it’s super bright out, but other than that the warm display is perfect regardless of day or night.•  You have many intensity levels of cool brightness to ranges of the warm temperature effect that can match your need. From mild yellow to full-on amber color, Amazon finally put in the right software for this display because I’m getting a clear display and no glare regardless of any ambient lighting.•  The E-ink display is very fast and efficient. I mean you’re just reading so the processing power isn’t that much as I didn’t notice any ghosting while reading.•  This is one of the only times that I’m glad for a bezel border because I can always place my hand at the perfect spot on the device, right underneath the page buttons.•  The page buttons themselves provide great feedback when I press them.  They’re not loud but it does give you that little click, which I love. You can use the touch screen to turn pages, but I felt the buttons provide a better experience.•  Regardless if you're left or right-handed, the device is ambidextrous! I flip the screen to my left the display adapts to it, just as if I flipped it to the right. The experience is the same for all.•  I took it out in a clear sunny day and the anti-glare matte display screen provided perfect viewing angles even when the sun was hitting at it the most.•  The touch screen is responsive as I like that it has a soft-touch texture on it. It creates a pleasurable experience and kills the creations of my fingerprint.•  IPX8 waterproof means it can be washed off and taken almost anywhere. I didn’t submerge it in a pool of water but an IPX8 will stand almost all forms of water issues (just don’t use it under the water.)•  Bluetooth is super-fast. Connecting my Airpods took less than 20 seconds, and the feedback is spot on.•  Battery life is in no way going to be an issue. From my one battery test, I got around 21 hours of use! The average person will probably read 30-40 minutes a day with this.  Having Wi-Fi on will eat a lot more but, in the end, the math doesn’t lie.•  The software of highlighting text, placing bookmarks, getting extra info about your book, and adding notes is very straight forward and doesn’t require digging around the system to use them. For me, one feature I use a lot is tapping a word and get the dictionary pulled up for the word (you need Wi-Fi).•  You can input MOBI, PDF, and TXT files on this device (I’ll go into more details later on).•  One cool feature I like is that if you use your kindle email address, you can upload files to your Oasis. I found this 10x quicker as I used this format when transferring my Steve Jobs autobiography book from my IPad to the Oasis (via email).•  At the time pf my review, I found 10 different fonts, 14 sizes, and numerous alignment choices. I can save numerous themes and have the option to switch back and forth if I wanted to. I found this feature helpful if more than one person uses this device.•  The books themselves are pretty cheap to buy on Amazon. It’s even better if you’re a Prime member because you can “borrow” books from the Prime Reading catalog. There is also Amazon First Reads that I like but overall, if you get this device, Amazon is the way to go in getting your books/magazines.•  Unlike a smartphone, I know that if you treat your Oasis right, you’ll get a pretty good shelve life with it.Cons and Oks:__________•  Just like Amazon’s previous models, no USB-C connector. Micro-USB brings slow for charging and importing files.  With Micro-USB, I’m getting around 3 hours, 0-100%, for a complete charge.•  No headphone jack! No idea why this isn’t built-in because they even have the room for it on the device.•  Getting used in finding your brightness and temperature setting will take some time. Amazon gives a lot of options on the display, as I spent a decent amount of time just figuring out which type of lighting I wanted.•  The keyboard is a touchscreen keyboard.  So expect a slow typing rate. Sadly I can’t apply the tracing effect that many androids and google phones provide on their keyboards.• The aluminum design does make this slippery to hold, and it’s able to slide off my lap pretty easily.• Also, with aluminum, it takes in the heat or the cold a lot quicker if you leave it outdoors or in a hot car.• Without a decent cover, it feels like I’m holding a piece of metal than the feeling of holding a book.•  Can’t connect to 5GhZ Wi-Fi network.•  Even if this Oasis looks the same as its previous models, I found out that you can’t really use the same covers.  My colleague has the older model and issue we found is that the magnet covers of the last case model don’t stick with the new Oasis.  Almost the same size and weight, you expect that older covers to work, but nope. I’ll have to pay for a new case cover.•  At the time of my review, I get ads on the lock screen of the device. You can remove them, but you have to pay around $20 to make it ad-free. I found this ridiculous given what you’re already paying for it.•  As I mentioned before, you can upload MOBI, PDF, and TXT files on this device.  This is cool, but when I put in a simple pdf file (composed of a small story) the formatting gets lost in the process. The paragraphs were mashed together, there was a delay when you wanted to turn to the next page, and overall it looks like a big mess.  Now, this could be just a one-time event, but I have to assume any third party software that goes into the Oasis will face some issues (Importing audiobooks did work flawlessly though).•  No microSD. That means the storage you have is what you’re going to have forever. This is buzz kill because I know for only 8 GB (Minus 1 GB for the initial software) you’re going to only have maybe 20 audiobooks go have on storage.  It seems more appropriate, given the shelf life of this device, to just invest in the 32 GB since there is no way to upgrade the 8 GB.•  It’s small, but not small enough to fit your pocket. Be careful where you put it because I feel like I can bend this without any issue if I wanted to.•  The browser feature, I believe, is very experimental. Because of the display, many webpages are shown up broken or just unreadable. Obliviously this isn’t for web browsing, but it’s a feature they provide that I just ignore.•  It’s almost the same in software and design as its previous model. With the price, I was expecting Amazon to a least redesign it into something different (maybe less in the bezels).  It’s still a beautiful design but, given the identical looks as its previous model, as the only main difference is the warm color effect. I know this is what Amazon is advertising but they had 2 years to redesign it. I guess the saying goes “if it ain't broke, don't fix it.”Bottom Line:__________As not having a Kindle before this, I would say that I’m having a pleasant time reading with this.  I always prefer a “real” book to read, but having thousands of books at my fingertips, it does reduce that need. To be honest, it’s kind of scary to see the possibility that kids can use this more than a physical book. It reminds me of a scene from the 1960’s film “The Time Machine,” where George goes into to future to find out that all the books he touches turn into a fine powder because no one has used them in centuries.But ignoring that thought, there really isn’t any competition for devices like these, and Amazon does know how to build them. It's sleek, fast, and most importantly, the screen is superb in reading. The warm light effect does make me feel that I’m still reading an old book, while the battery life is holding its ground.Note, if anyone has the previous model of the Oasis, don’t bother buying this.  It’s the same thing, except without the warm display and some small software upgrades. For new people, I recommend that you invest in the 32 GB because 8 GB is not nearly enough (given that you can’t even install a MicroSD to it). There are some smaller issues with the design of the device that make me feel like I’m holding a machine instead of a book, but for those who want to take a leap in digital reading, this is the way to go.Overall: An above-average device for book readers of all ages, and a small step forward in the extinction of physical books.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer.\n"", ""\n  Much more practical than physical books. Though it has these annoying flaws that I expect to be gone with the next generation of Kindle readers:1. Not exactly like white paper of a new physical book. The background has an earthy grey tint. You need more light for acceptable contrast.2. No purely red light night time mode. The warmest color setting still emits plenty of blue and green light that lowers your sleep quality.3. It's cold and slippery. Doesn't feel that good in your hands. No good grip.\n"", '\n  First of all, the screen is amazing.  Clear and crisp.  I love it.  Having all the options for the lighting including the softer light, just put me in heaven.  The Kindle is the sole reason I can read.  Secondly, the audible books are a real plus.  Having bluetooth apps, the Kindle can par with almost any bluetooth device.  I paired it with my Bose Headset and bluetooth speaker.The only negative for me is the battery life.  If you listen to a book, or use the browser, the battery life shoots down very quickly.  Having just received my Kindle yesterday, I want to see the battery life if I only read.I am thrilled with this new Kindle.  Having small cataracts in my eyes, along with my stigmatism, made reading books  so unpleasant.  The Kindle changed that immediately.  I hope to become an avid reader.Special note, take a look at the covers for the Kindle Oasis 9th and 10th generation.  What a gorgeous variety of artistic colors, designs, and natural scenes.Joyce\n', '\n  Comparing with the 2017 oasis with the battery cover, nowhere near as good. Metal is slippery, slides in your hands when using without a cover. Feels heavier. Wish they had just improved the 2017 model. No need for audible or blue tooth. Cell phone covers that need. That tech bulks up the price and weight.\n', ""\n  I bought this after I lost my Kindle Voyage. It's a great little device and I'm pleased with it. However I can't say that it's significantly better than the Voyage that it replaced, which may be why Amazon stopped selling the Voyage. In fact the Voyage had page turning buttons on both sides, which was a bit more convenient. On the other hand, this has different kinds of lighting, which is a nice touch, and is a bit smaller. It's a great device but not worth the price of upgrading if you have a Voyage already (unless of course you desperately want to read in the bathtub).\n""]"

I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (1 Kindle Touch, 1 Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and 1 Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 – 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 –8th generation). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the “Saving Money on Purchases” section).Below is my summary of the “all-new Kindle” (Kindle 10th generation). I have spent the past few days playing around with the Kindle, reading from it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Kindle model was last refreshed in 2016. This model is the lowest-end basic flagship model of the Kindle e-reader.THE BOX: The Kindle device, a quick-start guide, and a USB cord. The item arrived sealed well. Please note that Amazon does not provide a wall adapter. Also, the Kindle box is smaller than the Paperwhite box.Availability: Black and White are the base colors variants. Additionally, Kindle fabric covers can be purchased for $29.99 in 4 different colors: Charcoal Black, Cobalt Blue, Punch Red, and Sandstone White from Amazon. I wouldn’t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better.Summary of key aspects that have changed:- Price increase of $10 from the prior version- An adjustable backlight composed of 4 LEDs that helps readers with reading both indoors and outdoors. I love this feature. This feature alone justifies the additional $10 price increase in my opinion.- Updated design- Latest e-ink technology for better contrast that helps makes the text crisper. The text is crisper than prior version (see images) but not as crisp as higher end models.Things that have not changed from prior Kindle model:- Battery life remains the same- Charge time remains the same- Glare-free display- Option to hear Audible books through Bluetooth headphones or speakers.- Screen size remains the same at 6 inch- Storage remains the same at 4GB- Warranty remains the same: 1-year limited warranty and service along with product purchase. An additional warranty should be separately purchased if deemed necessary.Technical specs:- 167 pixel per inch (PPI) capacitive touch display (please note that though the PPI value remains the same as the prior model, there is sharper contrast because of the new e-ink technology used in the newer model)- 6-inch screen- Bluetooth- LED(s): 4 LED- Storage: 4 GB- Size: 6.3” x 4.5” x 0.34” (160 x 113 x 8.7 mm). As compared to the prior model, there is a 2mm reduction in width and 4 mm reduction in depth/height).- Weight: 6.1 oz (As compared to prior Kindle 8, there is a 0.4 oz increase in weight).Comparison between Kindle 10 (this version – 2019 release) referred to as Kindle below and Kindle Paperwhite (10th generation-2018 release – mid-tier model):- Charge: Kindle holds 4 weeks of charge while Kindle Paperwhite holds 6 weeks of charge- Connectivity: Kindle only has Wi-Fi option while Kindle Paperwhite offers Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi + Cellular Connectivity- Cost: Kindle costs $89.99 while Kindle Paperwhite costs $129.99 though previous sales were present that offered the item for $89.99 which can be stacked (please read below section on saving money for Kindle purchases)- LEDs: Kindle has 4 LEDs while Kindle Paperwhite has 5 LEDs- PPI: Kindle has 167 PPI while Kindle Paperwhite has 300 PPI- Water resistance: Kindle has no IPX8-rating (basically not water-resistant) while Kindle Paperwhite has the IPX8-rating (i.e., it allows submersion in 2 meters of fresh water for up to one hour).- Storage: Kindle offers 4GB storage while Kindle Paperwhite offers additional storage (8 GB or 32 GB)- Design: Kindle doesn’t have the flush front design while Kindle Paperwhite does Display size: remains the same (6 inches).-Total size: Even though the display size (previously mentioned) remains the same the specs of the items are different. Kindle: 10 6.3” x 4.5” x 0.34” (160 x 113 x 8.7 mm) while Kindle Paperwhite: 6.6” x 4.6” x 0.3” (167 x 116 x 8.18 mm).- Weight: Kindle 10 weighs 6.1 oz while Kindle Paperwhite Wi-Fi: 6.4 oz (182 g) Wi-Fi + Free Cellular Connectivity: 6.8 oz (191 g).I have refrained from comparing the Kindle Oasis in this review with the Kindle 10 because it is the highest-end model and if a consumer is looking at this model, then it is highly unlikely they are considering the Kindle Oasis. Besides, the Kindle Oasis costs around 3 times the amount of the Kindle 10 and 2 times the cost of the Kindle Paperwhite. Consequently, it would not be a fair and/or necessary comparison for this review.Some useful features on Kindle readers (not a comprehensive list):- Accessibility features: VoiceView screen reader (works through Bluetooth audio) and provides directions to help visually impaired readers to navigate through the device and read books with text-to-speech (this feature is only available in the English language). Additionally, to help visually impaired readers, Kindle also includes the ability to adjust the font size, font face, line spacing, and margins.- Smart Lookup (quickly check the default dictionary). The default, New Oxford American Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary of English (both from Oxford University Press).- Supports the following content formats: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively; HTML DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, PMP through conversion; Audible audio format (AAX).- Users can review Wikipedia to understand word meanings better.- Integration with Goodreads (Amazon-owned book database).- Option to highlight words on the screen- Pdf and word documents can be sent to Kindle through email after a Kindle-specific email address is created.- Provides the option to share word or texts and additional commentary by the user.- Add a note regarding the word.- Translate a word from English to 16 languages.- Whispersync (sync progress across Kindle devices and apps)- X-Ray tool, which provides detailed information on key content in the book (i.e. “bones of the book”).Testing:Speed: Comparable to prior modelsWi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network and use the experiential browser without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.Saving money on purchasing the Kindle:- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles you to a free 3-month Kindle Unlimited subscription ($29.97 value). After 3-months subscription will auto-renew at $9.99 (this promo discount can be taken out at any point in time). This makes this purchase a worthwhile purchase with additional savings.- The cost for the Kindle will be $109.99 (without special offers). Customers can also disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Kindle with special offers ($89). Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 kindles all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the $89 kindle and then remove the special offers (which might probably end up saving you a few dollars because there are no taxes for disabling offers).- Customers should also know that they can easily trade-in their prior Kindle for Amazon gift cards ($5-$25) and also receive a 25% discount towards their new Kindle.- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get around $30 off, and then stack the trade-in and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $30-$40 if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.Conclusion:To sum up, my review, this is the base version of the Kindle. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. I absolutely love the Kindle LEDs in this model. It makes a world of difference for night reading specifically when my family is in bed, and I don’t have to get up to turn on/off the house lamp and make a ton of noise. The bottom line is that the Kindle e-readers are incontestably the best e-readers currently in the market. This Kindle follows in the same trajectory as prior versions.April 16, 2019:  UPDATE # 1I would personally recommend the Kindle Paperwhite (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Kindle 10 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several other features like higher resolution (300 PPI vs. 167 PPI), more LEDs (5 vs. 4), water resistance (IPX-8 rating), larger storage (8 or 32 GB), and a cellular option for higher-end models will give the edge for customers looking for more options. However, the Kindle 10 does well for a base entry model.April 18, 2019:  UPDATE # 2After additional testing, I have given the Kindle 10, 5/5 stars in my review (instead of the initial 4/5 stars). I did consider docking down ½ a star for no increase of PPI for this version (167 PPI). However, please note that the e-ink quality has significantly improved and the LEDs make a world of difference, so this is Kindle is much better (factoring in reader comfort and quality) than the prior Kindle model even though both have the same PPI. Besides, this is the base version. What more can one expect for $89? Additionally, please note that the PPI is not a big issue for those that don’t regularly use the device for reviewing images, graphs, pictures, manga, illustrations, etc. Please review my picture (uploaded) comparison between text of the Kindle Paperwhite 3rd gen and Kindle 10 for comparison purposes. It is hard to see any distinction on a cursory observation.Please also note that several resources were used in the compilation of this review, but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review.\n', ""\n  The pros: I like that you have a choice of colors and that it comes with a front light. It's small and easy to carry around. If you've never had a Kindle before or never had one higher than the base, you won't notice the 167 ppi difference between it and the Paperwhite and the Oasis.The cons: If, however, you're like me and you have an Oasis, you'll immediately notice how much less crisp the letters and pictures are.Don't get me wrong. It's a good price for a starter Kindle, especially with lights now. For someone who's looking for the best reading experience they can get without spending too much money, it's a good choice.However, for a few dollars more, they can get a Paperwhite with better resolution, waterproofing, and more storage (2x more for the base Paperwhite model).So what should you get? If you're more concerned with saving money, go for the Kindle Basic. Otherwise, about thirty dollars more gets you a big improvement.\n"", '\n  I wouldn\'t purchase this product for the following reason: my 3rd Gen. Kindle has 300 ppi and this supposed ""new"" one has only 167 ppi so what gives?\n', ""\n  Don't buy into the petty negative reviews. The improvements to the basic Kindle are great! I've been reading on mine the past several days and I'm extremely impressed. The lighting is the brightest, whitest and most even I've seen. It's comfortable to hold, easy to read, and just as responsive as my Oasis and my husband's Paperwhite. Highly recommend!\n"", '\n  November 8, 2020 update:I still really like this Kindle, and I stand by my review\'s pros and cons as I discussed below. I\'ve read over 50 books on it since I purchased it and I\'m a happy camper.April 15, 2019 (Original review):I had a Kindle touch years ago and had stopped using it. But I want to be able to focus on reading and not pop-ups from other apps so I bought this new Kindle to avoid the distractions of reading on my phone.The device is smaller than both my original Kindle touch and my husband\'s Kindle Paperwhite. I was able to quickly get connect to the internet and begin downloading Kindle books I checked out via Overdrive. The device can be held in one hand comfortably, and it\'s lightweight enough to feel quite portable without appearing flimsy.This Kindle has some buggy-feeling holdovers from previous generations: occasional leftover pixels during page/screen pages. However, I find the touch screen to be responsive without being jumpy. The bottom/power button sometimes takes an extra push to activate, or perhaps just needs me to focus a bit more. I don\'t mind the ""special offers"" and generally ignore them completely, yes, this is a generally annoying feature, but I\'d rather spend that $20 on books. The backlight can be adjusted to read outdoors or in your bedroom in the dark (handy if your partner nags about keeping a booklight on).Another reviewer commented on the PPI. Personally, as I don\'t use the device for pictures/illustrations/detailed charts, I frankly don\'t care. The images that appear in the special offers are clear enough, and the default sized print is crisp and clean and I have no issues reading without my glasses. If you frequently read books that are illustration/graphic-heavy, you may prefer a Paperwhite or other device.I\'ll adjust my review if my sentiments change but for now I am very happy with my new Kindle.\n']"

On this device I find that it goes to zero even when not being used after a full charge. Where as the Kindle Touch would last forever (3 week give or take) on one charge and you never think of taking your charger on a trip, all you did was ensure it was fully charged before you left home.

I do think for the money it's extremely useful and dependable.  Some apps dont work and some sites can't get to but overall I would say get  one = its soooooo worth the money. I bought my son daughter and husband one . It's so handy and the battery really does last all day playing with it.  My big complaint is its tough to print from at times. Bezos please fix that one thing!\n"", '\n  Great kindle.  Nice big screen.  Light.  Love that it came with a case. Total bonus for me since I didnt even realize it came with one when I bought it.\n', '\n  Love this reader.  It holds tons of everything I need to travel, sit at home, or go to work.\n', ""\n  It's my fault, but I was expecting this to be easier to adjust to from an android tablet. I really don't want to learn a new OS.\n"", '\n  Liked the pastel colors.  Was as expected, but durability and value can only be found after much more use.\n']"
