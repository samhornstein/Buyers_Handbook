Well worth the money.\n', '\n  I specialize in tech reviews and try to help buyers find the best gear at fair value. The 2020 iPad Pros have meaningful improvements I’ll detail below. A major one is much improved 10-hour battery life. But why settle for longer battery life when your new iPad takes forever to charge? Fortunately, there’s an easy fix:Apple is famous for marketing state of the art iPhones and iPads that unfortunately come with slow, subpar chargers. The new iPad Pros come with a ridiculously slow 18 watt charger. For under $30 you can ditch the slow Apple charger and fix the problem.  However, with zillions of wall chargers out there, it’s easy for anyone’s eyes to get glazed over looking for which to buy. Here’s what to look for:IPAD PRO CHARGING BRICKS: Which to buy / Tips:It’s essential you get one labeled “USB-C Power Delivery.” This is also known as PD. For wattage, look for 30w and be sure the full 30 watts is coming out of the USB-C jack. Some have dual ports and might be labeled 36w but limit 18 watts to each jack. I’ve reviewed many PD chargers and have found that it is best to stick with reputable brands with warranties of at least a year, and up to two years. I’ve tested several and recommend Aukey, Choetech, Anker, and AmazonBasics. I have no relationship with any tech company. Use your USB-C to USB-C cable that comes with the new iPad Pros. No need to buy another cable. Below are some links:AUKEY:For under $25, this great model also includes an old fashioned but still useful USB-A jack. To get the full 30 watts to your new iPad, don’t charge a second device at the same time. The 24 month warranty is far better than most:https://www.amazon.com/AUKEY-Charger-Delivery-Dynamic-MacBook/dp/B083DD37W7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=USB+C+Wall+Charger%2C+AUKEY+USB+C+Charger+30W&qid=1585825322&sr=8-1CHOETECH:For just over $20, this 30w PD model is compact and great for travel with its foldable plug. The warranty is 18 months. It comes only in black:https://www.amazon.com/Charger-CHOETECH-Foldable-Compatible-Nintendo/dp/B083DM83BX/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=choetech+30w+pd+charger&qid=1585825382&sr=8-4ANKER:Anker may be the best known of third party brands but its once stellar customer service is now frustratingly difficult at times. Yet, they make great products, although warranties are limited. This model is super compact, comes with 18-month warranty and is quite “Apple like” at under $30:https://www.amazon.com/AK-A2017121-27W-PD-1-Port/dp/B07DFGKFM3/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=anker+30w+pd+charger&qid=1585825876&s=electronics&sr=1-3AMAZONBASICS:I like dealing with Amazon because their customer service is typically stellar. At under $30, this one will charge your new iPad PRO at 30 watts for highest charging speed and will also charge the latest USB-C Mac laptops at high speed. However, it is larger than the others and only carries a one-year warranty:https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Charger-Laptops-Tablets-Delivery/dp/B07PBCKXP7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1SHOULD YOU BUY A PD CHARGER WITH MORE THAN 30 WATTS?Chargers with more than 30 watts WILL NOT give you faster charging unless you are also using it for a recent Mac laptop. Apple and most PC laptops require 45 watts for fastest charge. Recent iPhones only come with 5w or 12w chargers but need 18 watts with Power Delivery for fastest charge. So don’t toss the new 18-watt charger that comes with the new iPad Pro. Use it for your iPhone and you’ll be amazed it charges to 50% in just 30 minutes.IPAD PRO BUYING TIPS: SHOULD YOU UPGRADE TO A NEW 2020 MODEL OR NOT?For most power users, yes. The longer battery life as compared with earlier models is absolutely worth it. Apple is not stretching it when it says 10 hours although intense gaming will deplete the battery faster.For general users, maybe. The faster A12Z bionic chip is tremendously zippy but folks who are casual internet browsers will not notice the change. However, this model is fantastic as a laptop replacement with its support for Apple’s stellar Magic Keyboard, the Apple (and some third party) pencils, and the Smart Keyboard Folio.If you take pictures with your iPad, the camera is the best Apple has yet packaged with any device. Terrific. In this Covid era, it’s ultrawide lens is also great for live streaming of meetings. Speaking of meetings, the built in microphones surpass most laptops. For music listening, the new iPads deliver clean and pleasing audio, with surprisingly fine bass. Yes, your new iPad Pro can actually crank up the jams! Good to know if you are stuck in the house.IPAD PRO FOR GAMING: SHOULD YOU UPGRADE TO A NEW 2020 MODEL OR NOT?A giant YES! We have a family member who is quite successful in the gaming world. If you are coming from any other mobile device other than the 2018 iPad Pros, the 120 frames per second (FPS) frame rate of the new Pros must be seen to be appreciated. Silky, slick and so fast! No lag with a good internet connection. Games such as Fortnight have recently upgraded to support 120 FPS. If your favorite game supports it, a new iPad Pro is an absolutely terrific no brainer investment.CONCLUSION:I hope this long review has been of some help. I’m sending my very best to you and yours for health and prosperity, and better days ahead. The new iPad Pros are stellar, light as a feather, and Apple’s best ever for ultra fast speed, productivity, and laptop-replacing good times.\n', ""\n  This device is totally out of this world. I upgraded from the iPad Pro 2016(1st gen) and the difference is overwhelming. Even with normal use(browsing and switching between apps) it’s blazing fast. I also have an iPhone 11 Pro Max but this feels even faster than that. Games like Fortnite and ARK literally run better on this than my console because of the ultra fast GPU and 120hz display(Fortnite on 120fps will blow your mind). I opted for the 11 inch model because my previous iPad which was a 12.9 was too heavy for carrying around, this is the perfect size in my opinion(Also much thinner). Speakers are twice as loud. Even after a lot of gaming, It easily runs a whole day on a full charge. I have been using the 30W usb-c charger that came with my MacBook Air and it gets to full in about an hour and a half. I’m thinking about getting an Apple Pencil soon for college work. Guys if your thinking about getting this, don't think get it!. You're getting the best tablet if you prefer speed, multitasking and gaming. What a tremendous tablet this is. Haven’t found any flaws in it. Perfect tablet overall.\n"", '\n  I’ve been using MacBook pros for a long time.  Looking to lighten the load a bit.  First iPad was a 10.2” a few weeks ago.  Liked it, sent it back and bought an iPad Air.  Liked that one more, but sent it back for this iPad Pro 11”.Still learning the ropes around its use.  I like the speed, display, quad speakers and looking forward to the Apple keyboard with track pad.  The size is just right;  Feels like my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ on steroids!Now waiting for Zugu Case to release the 2020 iPad Pro 2nd generation case.  Also waiting on an order for the Targus VersaVu (portrait/landscape view) and a ZtotopCase.  Currently using an inexpensive ESR Yippee Trifold Smart Case that doesn’t inspire confidence in handling or protection.Hopefully the learning curve with gestures etc. will be short, the keyboard will become available sooner than later, and Apple keeps going in the direction of a true, lightweight MacBook alternative.\n', '\n  Excellent IPad Pro! I previously owned a couple of iPads that were great, but the pro takes everything to the next level. Perfect amount of memory, excellent multitasking tool, & amazing screen to watch video of any kind. Highly recommended!\n', '\n  Upgraded from the pro 9.7 and love it! Its not fundamentally a different experience but everything is much much faster. Also, the 120hz display is a game changer for responsiveness. Hope iPhone gets it soon!\n', '\n  This was a gift to me, and I love it. I’m actually using it right now.\n']"

It's a bit faster, a bit thinner, a bit lighter, and a bit shinier than all the tablets I've used before. But, taken altogether--and taken along with the second-gen Apple Pencil--it feels like an entirely new experience. I haven't been this struck by a new device in a while.Over the years, I've owned three or four iPads, a few Android tablets, and a few convertible touchscreen laptops running various OSes. I've always been partial to Samsung because of the S Pen, and I've owned a couple of Galaxy Tabs and the Chromebook Pro: I love taking handwritten notes during meetings, and I like writing my first drafts by hand.But this device, with the Pencil, is leaps and bounds better than any other tablet I've used. Writing and drawing on it feels completely intuitive and fluid. The responsiveness of the interface with the pencil is amazing--it reproduces my handwriting (chicken scratch that it is) perfectly. And more than that, the built-in handwriting recognition in the OS is frankly astounding. Either using the Scribble feature to handwrite form entries or using the Notes app's feature that lets you search your handwritten notes, everything works FAR better than I expected them to. Let me reiterate: my handwriting is atrocious. And yet, this iPad is able to decipher my hieroglyphics with a frequency that actually makes the feature really useful--I was expecting it to be little more than a gimmick, as in the past handwriting recognition apps have been completely useless for me. There've been a few times where I actually giggled out loud when the iPad recognized something I'd written that I could barely read myself.Outside of how perfectly the iPad, iPadOS14, and Pencil have all integrated into my workflow, the design of the device itself is very nice, and the build quality is excellent. The tablet feels oddly light while still feeling very sturdy. And it's thin--even Apple's marketing images really don't do it justice. And obviously the new processor is nice, though I won't pretend to have done enough to even come close to pushing its limits. But the entire experience has been very smooth, even playing around with video editing and trying to find the most graphically-intensive games on the App Store I could. Haven't seen any lag or stuttering at all.All that said, it's not perfect. I do wish Apple was finally putting OLEDs into more of their devices outside of the iPhone. The screen on this really is gorgeous, don't get me wrong. And the blacks aren't awful or anything. But given how great everything else is on this device, having a backlit screen--as advanced and pretty as it is--just feels weird. And I'm kind of ambivalent about the power button TouchID. Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled the Home button is gone, but I think I'd kinda prefer FaceID. The TouchID on this iPad works great, and it does work very quickly, but I'm spoiled by being used to just tapping the screen on my iPhone and having it unlock itself automatically.Anyway, those minor gripes aside, this is a great little device, it fit itself into my workflow immediately. I think the highest praise I can give it is that it's amazing how quickly it effectively disappeared: within a couple days of using it, I stopped noticing it, because everything about writing and taking notes with the iPad and the Pencil felt second nature, it felt like it had always been there. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.\n"", '\n  Having had ipad , ipad air 2, I would have to say this is the best one yet.  Compared to my previous ones, this is blindingly fast, easy to transition and load all my apps from my ipad air 2. I took a bit of time to get used to no home button, but not an issue and the larger screen is a plus. Bottom line, I think this is the best model, unless you absolutelt need the additional features of the ipad pro.ONLY issue I have is with the method of shipment from Amazon. I am a prime member and appreciated the fact that I ordered my two ipad air 4’s on the 23 rd of Oct and got them the 25th. Super! My only issue is them being delivered by USPS, dropped off on my front door, no signature or anything else for $1300 worth of product.  Luckily I am in a great neighborhood, but one would expect UPS or FEDEX with a signature.Got them ok though and am very happy with my purchase. And am 99% satisfied with Amazon as well.\n', ""\n  doesn't work that great slow, to many apps person over 65 to many apps to hard to set up, set-up finger print ok but what if you have other person you want to use it YES you can by pass that but need more user friendly for person over 68 and map area outdated and a person can got somewhere else for a lot less and not applethat I would like apple but didn't  always wanting to try new things but didn't like it some many but I didn't this was just my opinion thank you\n"", '\n  I purchased this as a sort-of alternative to my laptop. Just something to surf the web and social media on and play the occasional game. The speakers on this thing are INCREDIBLE. So loud and full of depth, it’s great to stream music off of. Totally recommend this for the casual user, and with it’s new chipset, this thing can handle some serious multitasking for the not-so casual. If you’re on the fence about buying an iPad Pro, I recommend you consider this as an option instead, unless video editing is something you’re planning to do constantly. I have no quarrel with this product! It has served me well so far.\n', ""\n  I held off replacing my iPad Air 2 in hopes the Air 4 would be worth it. So far, the Air 4 has worked flawlessly. The migration was so easy and fast; just backup old iPad to iCloud then using the same Apple ID do a Restore from Backup to the new iPad. All my apps and their associated data was installed in Air 4. Incredible! The graphics are beautiful, the new CPU is very fast, I've been an iPhone 11 user for a while so the absence of the Home button wasn't a big deal, but I do find myself reaching to the where the Home button used to be. I had considered the low-end iPad Pro but Air 4 costs less and for my needs, gets the job done. You won't be disappointed. PS- I got free next day  shipping with Amazon, too.  That's a big plus.\n"", '\n  I think this particular iPad will be a pretty big deal for those looking for (almost) iPad Pro power and functionality, with a slightly better price tag. I love my purchase, and this new iPad Air is really a nice step up from the iPad 7th gen that I’m trading in. I highly recommend this new iPad Air!!\n']"

As a brief history I have owned the iPad mini 3 and the iPad 5th generation. The new A12 chip makes this iPad so fast and fluid and is honestly more power than I will ever need in my day to day use of this product. I love that this iPad has a fully laminated display it makes reading on it so much better and of course it  eliminates that annoying air gap that is on the budget iPad 5th and 6th gen. Another of the great features of this iPad is the True Tone display that adjusts the display to the lighting conditions of the room your in. This makes it much easier on your eyes when your using the iPad and it’s effects are in my opinion most notable when reading. The battery life on this iPad is excellent and the A12 chip is to thank for that since it’s very efficient, with how much I use it I can go for days on a single charge though of course your mileage will vary based on use and other settings. The mini definitely falls into an odd market as it has the same specs as the new iPad Air just in a much smaller form factor, so I’d definitely recommend the mini if you’ve got an older iPad and want to upgrade without breaking the bank and don’t mind the smaller form factor or even prefer your iPads in a more portable form. Also if your looking to buy an iPad for the first time and you want one that isn’t exactly a budget model but at the same time you don’t want to spend the kind of money it takes to get a pro model then the mini 5 might just be for you. I’m in the camp of people that prefer this smaller form as it’s easier to port around and if you read books on it it’s not going to tire your arm out like the larger models. The mini definitely has a viable market even in 2019 and I believe is worth a look if your curious about how an iPad of this size compares to the much larger versions that Apple sells.\n', '\n  Perfect, exactly what I was waiting for.  I was (am) an owner of the original gen1 iPad Mini, which I loved.  However, it has become too slow for most use cases and is 2 iOS revs back, so I had to upgrade.  I was holding out for an update, not wanting to purchase the Mini-4 which is already 2+ years old.  The Mini-5 is very fast, responsive and the perfect size for how I use an iPad.\n', ""\n  I've had a couple of small Android tablets for reading books and newspapers (via Kindle) and general web articles. This beats those tablets for three reasons. First, the pixel resolution is better. Second, the 4:3 screen ratio is better for reading compared to the 16:9 and 16:10 ratios on the other two tablets. Third, It looks to me that Amazon has better IOS than Android Kindle software. The Android software will sometimes get the pages of the newspaper messed up (NY Times) requiring the software to be reloaded. I have not seen that yet with this tablet.I bought the space gray color with the base 64G of storage. I did pay extra for the 4G capability because I had a low cost subscription from T-Mobile. The nano-sim quickly moved from my old tablet to this one. I have not tried their eSim option.

When I got my new iPad pro 12.9 I was anxious to try an official apple case.  It was hard because it is expensive but I really do like it.It is true that there is no protection around the edges but that's the very thing I enjoy about it.  It gives you the feeling of not having a case.  I like the way your iPad just magnetically attaches to the back of the case and can easily be removed.  It feels like a nice heavy duty material (compared to some off-brands).  I think it stands up well when folded the correct way.If your looking for something with drop protection then you may want to check out some other cases but if you're looking for something to protect the front and back but want the 'no case' experience.  This is a great choice.  As a side note, when you fold the cover back it covers the camera but the part of the cover that covers the camera can easily be folded back (and magnetically holds there) to uncover it and take your picture.Though it's expensive, it feels like quality and I am really enjoying the experience.\n"", '\n  too expensive and does NOT protect the edgeswhy would I pay $100 for this when if I drop tablet it will shatter?!?\n', '\n  I have had a few prior iPads, with the original having an Apple folio one piece case & then my second for the iPad Pro 9.7 having two pieces from Apple, but offering complete edge protection. The case for the 12.9 Pro is pretty. However, there aren’t photos showing that there is absolutely no edge protection for your iPad. It is simply offering protection for the front & the back. If you drop it & it hits a corner, my assumption is that there will be damage to the iPad. I’m sending it back for this reason. It’s very unfortunate that you cannot tell from the pictures that there are no edges & you’d assume they are like prior similar Apple models. Apple should bring back the old style, especially with such a bulky iPad that could easily be dropped.\n', '\n  Getting some wired wear on the material in less then a month. I have used Apple smart cases on my other iPads for years and never had this issue I don’t think $100 case should show this kind of damage so quickly. I would return it but this is my 5th cases and I don’t think I’ll find a better one but it’s still just ok at bet, I miss the old one sides smart cases. I’m very careful with my electronics this cases has not even left my house or been put in bag just every day handling has created the rough patch.\n', '\n  Expensive but worth it. Don’t get a cheap case for something you spent $1K+ on. Just get the Apple original. Reading the reviews for off-brand cases should make that decision easy for you.\n', '\n  It\'s ""ok"". I would not have gotten this had i realized the texture would show off fingerprints so easily and the fold-up design for reading horizontally isn\'t as stable as I would like. I also would suggest a different color than the dark grey I got - hard to find in a dark room. It does attach easily and securely, but when you flip the lid open it can cover the camera lens. This does NOT provide a vertical/page format reading platform, tips over.\n', '\n  I like the color.  I like the way it works.  It\'s expensive for what it is.  That about sums it up.I did take a Sharpie and write, ""OPEN"" on the side I like to open it from, because it does not have any visually or tactile feature to indicate which side is which, and the fifth time I opened it upside down, I figured it needed some modification.\n', '\n  I know....$100 for a case, I get it. I was fortunate to have gotten a $100 Amazon gift card so it was essentially free. I absolutely love this case! The feel of it is smooth and soft, the inner lining is extra soft when compared to similar cases on Amazon. THE COLOR- to die for. I wanted a pop of color for my iPad and this citrus did its job. Just buy it.\n', ""\n  This product not worth paying over £ 90 for as I would not give you any more than £10. It's also poorly advertised as I was under the impression i was buying a iPad !! May be that's my fault but I am guessing I am not the only person that's ordered this thinking there getting a ipad. Not happy as I've tried to call Amazon but even with an account it's says it doesn't recognize my phone number?\n"", '\n  Arrived with seals broken and absolutely filthy!  DO NOT BUY!\n', ""\n  The iPad, with iPadOS 13, is great. Does it replace my need for a macbook or PC? No - because it still runs iPadOS and not MacOS.Buying a case with a keyboard attached therefore doesn't fit my usage needs - I'd far rather have the option of orientating the iPad at ~80 degrees or ~20 degrees, without having an attached keyboard in front of it.I found the cheap Logitech K380 Bluetooth keyboard was totally acceptable for the times I wanted an actual portable keyboard. At £20 and lighter than the £350 Apple keyboard case this is a bargain. I also have the Logitech MX Keys as my PC keyboard, so could easily switch to use the iPad as a 3rd screen at my desk when needed at the touch of a button (useful when WFH).Minus 1 star for the price.\n"", '\n  Zu aber erst einmal stellt sich natürlich die Frage, warum man zu diesem original- Folio greifen sollte, anstatt zu den weitaus günstigeren Drittanbietern.Aber eins nach dem anderen, denn die Hülle passt wie angegossen. Mehr noch, sie sitzt wie eine zweite Haut. Das iPad behält seine Eleganz und auch seine, wie ich finde, tolle Form bei. Hat man es in der Hand, so schmeicheln die Materialien regelrecht und man möchte es gar nicht mehr aus der Hand legen. Bei dem 12.9 Zoll Modell bleibt aber selbst mit der Hülle ein mulmiges bzw. unsicheres Gefühl beim Halten. Ja, die Hülle schützt natürlich vor Kratzern und hält auch durch die Magnetbefestigung bombenfest. Man hat auch die Möglichkeit die Vorderseite um zu klappen und das iPad aufzurichten, jedoch nur Vertikal, nicht Horizontal. Dies hält ebenso sicher und fest, selbst wenn man darauf zeichnet bzw. skizziert neigt es nicht zum kippen.Warum also dieses unsichere Gefühl? Der Stoß bzw. Kantenschutz kann durch diese smarte Hülle kaum gewährleistet werden. Apple legt die Messlatte für Eleganz und Optik sehr hoch, worunter natürlich die Sicherheit leidet. Die Hülle schließt nahezu haargenau mit den äußeren Kanten des iPad\'s ab. Optisch ist das ganze wirklich eine zehn von zehn.Die innere Seite der Hülle, welche auf der Bedienoberfläche aufliegt, hält ebenso leicht magnetisch und hat eine angenehm samtige,- fast schon Velours- Artige Oberfläche. Beim Aufklappen dieser wird automatisch das iPad aktiviert und kann sofort per Face- ID entsperrt werden.Mein Fazit für diese Hülle fällt trotz der negativen Aspekte bzw. dem geringen Schutz äußerst positiv aus. Mir war bewusst, dass es sich bei dieser eher um ein elegantes als um ein ""sicheres"" Produkt handelt. Ja, der Preis ist meiner Meinung nach tatsächlich deutlich zu hoch, allerdings ist die Qualität, sowie auch die verwendeten Materialien und der Nutzen dahinter mehr als zufriedenstellend.Von meiner Seite gibt es eine klare Kaufempfehlung.\n', '\n  Looks really nice and does the job\n']"

As a brief history I have owned the iPad mini 3 and the iPad 5th generation. The new A12 chip makes this iPad so fast and fluid and is honestly more power than I will ever need in my day to day use of this product. I love that this iPad has a fully laminated display it makes reading on it so much better and of course it  eliminates that annoying air gap that is on the budget iPad 5th and 6th gen. Another of the great features of this iPad is the True Tone display that adjusts the display to the lighting conditions of the room your in. This makes it much easier on your eyes when your using the iPad and it’s effects are in my opinion most notable when reading. The battery life on this iPad is excellent and the A12 chip is to thank for that since it’s very efficient, with how much I use it I can go for days on a single charge though of course your mileage will vary based on use and other settings. The mini definitely falls into an odd market as it has the same specs as the new iPad Air just in a much smaller form factor, so I’d definitely recommend the mini if you’ve got an older iPad and want to upgrade without breaking the bank and don’t mind the smaller form factor or even prefer your iPads in a more portable form. Also if your looking to buy an iPad for the first time and you want one that isn’t exactly a budget model but at the same time you don’t want to spend the kind of money it takes to get a pro model then the mini 5 might just be for you. I’m in the camp of people that prefer this smaller form as it’s easier to port around and if you read books on it it’s not going to tire your arm out like the larger models. The mini definitely has a viable market even in 2019 and I believe is worth a look if your curious about how an iPad of this size compares to the much larger versions that Apple sells.\n', '\n  Perfect, exactly what I was waiting for.  I was (am) an owner of the original gen1 iPad Mini, which I loved.  However, it has become too slow for most use cases and is 2 iOS revs back, so I had to upgrade.  I was holding out for an update, not wanting to purchase the Mini-4 which is already 2+ years old.  The Mini-5 is very fast, responsive and the perfect size for how I use an iPad.\n', ""\n  I've had a couple of small Android tablets for reading books and newspapers (via Kindle) and general web articles. This beats those tablets for three reasons. First, the pixel resolution is better. Second, the 4:3 screen ratio is better for reading compared to the 16:9 and 16:10 ratios on the other two tablets. Third, It looks to me that Amazon has better IOS than Android Kindle software. The Android software will sometimes get the pages of the newspaper messed up (NY Times) requiring the software to be reloaded. I have not seen that yet with this tablet.I bought the space gray color with the base 64G of storage. I did pay extra for the 4G capability because I had a low cost subscription from T-Mobile. The nano-sim quickly moved from my old tablet to this one. I have not tried their eSim option. The overall quality and feel is good but it does better wrapped in a slim no-slip case for carrying around. I'm using a Soke case.
