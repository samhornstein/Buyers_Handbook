Highly recommended! After one bottle you’ll be hooked.\n', ""\n  This is unbelievable.  I have bought several bottles hemp oil from others and nothing happen.  The only reason I bought this is that I did not see anything but good reviews on this.  The information is all true.  I had every symptom they said and it works, I have had so much relief I cannot say enough about the product.  I sleep better, my back and knees do not hurt as much and most of all it's natural.  I felt so much pain I couldn't tell you where I hurt.  Since taking these the pain became less and I could tell the doctors where the pain is.  I also wake up with no headaches.  This did not get rid of all my pain but made things more tolerable.  I have many health issues and I can not believe the relief I have from constant pain.  This works better then my pain medication.  I have serious pain and now it's less.  I never thought it was possible and I didn't believe all these people got the relief they said they did.  Well, all I can tell you is it worked for me and I recommend it to anyone with any of these issues.  I will be reordering this now forever.\n"", '\n  This oil has helped with my insomnia and anxiety. I put a dropper full under my tongue 30 minutes before I go to bed and I sleep better than I have in months. It actually helps shut my mind off and that’s not easy to do. This hemp oil is well worth the money. I will definitely be buying some more.\n', '\n  I order 250,000 mg from another manufacturer for my father-in-laws aches and discomforts. After I re-ordered another bottle for him I noticed this 400,000 mg bottle from Hempworks on Amazon so I decided to order a bottle myself. I am a senior golfer and I’m always really stiff after playing plus I hurt from the twisting on my right knee replacement. I tried Hempworks today after golfing and I liked that it also had MCT oil in it. I thought the instructions said 1-2 drops dosage (small print on bottle) so that’s what I tried. The stiffness and pain in my body reduced by about 90% after only a few minutes. It’s like I just received a back massage and iced my knee. I’m anxious to keep using it as the aches and pains are numerous once you are over 60!\n', '\n  Love the hemp mct oil mix it gives me the added energy during the day.\n', '\n  I have had my hemp oil for a week now. It came packaged perfectly even in bubble wrap! In the last week my stress level has been to the max! My in-laws were both in separate hospitals over an hour apart. My father in law passed away and we were called in to spend a few hours in the nursing home where my mother in law is on comfort care. With the COVID-19 there have been no visitors allowed in Pennsylvania in the nursing homes. So, we were very fortunate that they allowed myself and my 2 daughters in. So, ya a little stress! With the hemp oil I seemed to stay focused on what was best for both my in-laws and what they were going through as well as my daughters emotional well being!! Thank you for this wonderful product!! Not only my stress relief, my mind clarity but I do not seem to be hurting in my hips and knees like I normally do! If I feel this good after a week I can’t wait to see what a month may bring!!\n', ""\n  I started using this and quickly began to feel relieved after my first dosage. Work wasn't as anxiety inducing and the normal stress tension I feel in my neck was non-existent. I feel like my sleep is going to be deep.\n"", '\n  I wish I found this one earlier. I get headaches and migraines especially when I get stressed. When stressed can’t have a deep sleep and can’t stay alert or focused. This Hemp MCT oil helps definitely with stress and anxiety. And no more headaches that means no more over the counter medication. It’s plain simple and organic with mint flavor. Flavor is just about right, no after taste at all. Feels fresh.First thing in the morning, we all take in our house hold.I definitely stay more focused and I sleep better. I definitely recommend this. I will keep buying this Hemp oil regularly.\n']"
