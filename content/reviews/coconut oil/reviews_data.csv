I use it for my hair, to oil pull, to remove makeup, and as a supplement. I've purchased this item twice before and, judging from the other reviews, it's a hit or miss. My past two times have been extremely positive experiences-- I received coconut oil that smelled nice and tasted normal. However, when I repurchased for a third time a few days ago, the coconut oil that I received was not fresh. The first thing I noticed was that there were tiny yellow dots on the surface of the hardened oil. At first I thought it was mold but thought no way. I used a fork to dig into the yellow spots, hoping that I was just imagining it, but further inspection revealed just pockets of yellowish oil. I've attached a picture but it was very apparent that there were two different colors of oil solidified into one. I know that yellow oil meant that the coconut oil was not fresh so I gave it a test try, and it straight up tasted like vegetable oil. Not faint nutty taste at ALL. I've been using coconut oil for about ten years now so I'm very familiar with what it should taste like, so this was a red flag. I also let the oil melt and it wasn't the whitish-clearish color that I'm used to-- it was slightly more yellow (like diluted vegetable oil).I also read in the comments how there were huge pockets of air in the oil--- Just as an experiment, I let the coconut oil melt and then refroze it again and, sure enough, the level of oil was considerably lower than it was before, indicating that there were pockets of air in the oil. If you feel the jar, you'll also notice that it feels very light.Again, I love coconut oil and have been purchasing from Nutiva for over three years. Very disappointed in this last experience, but have bought great quality coconut oil from them before.\n"", '\n  I‚Äôve been using this coconut oil to help with my dogs allergies. She‚Äôs been itching so bad she‚Äôs going bald in a few spots. I put this directly onto her skin in the places she itches the most. It did help but not as much as actually feeding the coconut oil to her did. So now I‚Äôm adding it to her food daily and applying the coconut oil to her fur at night. I‚Äôve been doing this for a month now and her fur is getting super soft and she itches so much less. UPDATE: her fur finally grew back!! Still feed this to her daily.\n', ""\n  I researched through web md first, which coconut oil is the number one product and it leads any high priced or medication to give all the benefits for your skin, hair, and health benefits. Well I made a list of the top 10. #1 was nutiva and by the second use my skin showed immediate results. I have skin cancer and b4 my recent diagnosis I started experiencing dryness, skin tone was changing my face within 5 yrs just was not at all what has always been. I say this because I was blessed with beautiful skin, tone, and glow. So I knew something was wrong but everyone else said your imagining it. Well using this product 5 days straight out of seven brought me relieve from actual pain and redness, discoloration, and what looked like small zits or rash. skin has gotten 60% better within a month. Obviously the area where the Carcinoma is what it is but that's 3inches of my body. The rest is about to be back 100% guaranteed.\n"", ""\n  I bought this because it was on sale but wont be buying again because the taste was awful. Does not smell or taste anything like coconut. Tastes like melted crayons. I will only be using this as moisturizer now. I will go back to buying the Spectrum brand for my Bulletproof coffee and cooking because this brand does not cut it. Though it says it's unrefined and virgin, it doesn't taste like it.UPDATE***** changed my review from a 2 star-to a 5 star!*****Amazon kindly sent me a different replacement jar and it tastes and smells completely different. Like actual coconut! My previous one seems to have been a bad batch or somehow got heated up during shipment and possibly spoiled. Highly satisfied with Amazon customer service and with the product now! Love that A-to-Z guarantee.\n"", ""\n  I recently discovered coconut oil has been used for skin care, and my face tends to get red from heat.  I'm super tired of using man-made, synthetic garbage that works for short periods of time; who knows how healthy that would be in the long run?! I had another brand of coconut oil, and while I used it for 2 consecutive days, its container didn't give much information on where or how it was harvested. I read the best coconut oil to use on skin was unrefined, cold-pressed, and expelled by the manufacturer. I found another brand that claimed they did this, but the price didn't match the amount given, and neither did the reviews. However, I came across this brand via the article I read explaining how to use coconut oil as a facial wash, and I was very impressed with the farm-to-table attitude the company has. Not only does it work wonders on my skin, but it smells outstanding and tastes terrific!  Although this process is still new to me, I'm loving the results. My face improved dramatically overnight, and it is extremely encouraging to want to continue every night. I cannot recommend this brand enough!\n"", '\n  Using as cooking oil, toast spread, moisturizer, cuticle oil, chapstick, shaving cream, and lube. I am now 12% coconut. Highly recommend.\n', '\n  I am in love with mine. It works super well for what I wanted it for. Better even than I expected. And it just smells delicious too.I am very into cutting all chemicals from the products I use on my body and making my own all natural products.This coconut oil is an essential element in a a few things I make, including my lip balms and shower gels.  And my shampoo and conditioner bars.Also worked so nicely (and smelt great) in the natural underarm deoderant I made.\n', '\n  I bought this specifically to use as a hair mask! It melts right in your hands and turns into an oil which is easy to apply to the hair. I guess this will be good for cooking too!Tip: I apply from the shaft down to the ends of my hair. DO NOT put in roots or they will be super greasy which will be difficult to get out. I leave the oil in my hair overnight (with a towel on my pillow) and rinse in the shower the next day. I shampoo twice to make sure hair is not greasy.\n', ""\n  I have been researching the benefits of Virginia coconut oil and was impressed with all the health benefits. I used a spoon to separate some of it into another pot for face cream. And the original pot to cook with.Beauty treatment. I use this every night on my face and im really impressed with results. My skin is a lot more toned looking, plumper and the fine lines are gradually reducing. My deep eye wrinkles are still there but a lot more less crepy. Wish I has bought this in my 20s rather than late 40s but still never too late. Before this oil I was trying all expensive brands to reduce the sunbed damage of my late teen life.I also just started using it on my son's face who has dry cracked skin that blisters. With its antibacterial benefits I'm sure it will help as no other cream has.Cooking- replacing existing cooking oil with coconut oil has benefits of reducing fat in the arteries and some report weight loss. Although I can't tell if that is happening I'm willing to use it daily (2 tablespoons recommended) as I don't notice a taste difference. I've used it for frying, replaced 1/2 marg/butter with coconut oil in recipes  etc.Just read the benefits of using coconut oil.The pot initially looked big but i'm thinking I need the gallon one now as use it for everything.\n"", ""\n  To set the scene my bathroom cabinet is groaning under the weight of lotions, potions, balms, creams, serums and anything else that I'm gullible enough to fall for in the beauty ailse that claims to make me look 15 years young, give me hair that would make Rapunzel jealous and the body of a 20 year old. I am a marketing persons dream - celebrity endorsement, I'm there.  Flash packaging, I'm there. Buy one get one half price, you get the picture...After reading about the benefits of coconut oil I thought, why not?  I have been the owner of this little jar of miracles for about 4 days and I love it.  The smell, oh the smell!! As a child of the 70/80's Bounty Bars were as near as I was going to get to a coconut - these were times when Findus Crispy Pancakes, Birds Eye Potato Waffles followed by a bowl of Angel Delight were considered a perfectly good meal for a 10 year old.  I digress. It smells fab.  I was a little dubious about being able to eat something you could also put on your face.  Being a brave woman, I stuck my finger in and gave it a go.  Taste is delicious.So far I've used it as:A lip balm - chapped dry lips gone within 2 daysMoisturiser - scaly lizard like shins are goneFace balm - very small amount at nightHair De-frizzer - again a very small amount to banish the candy floss look as soon as it drizzles outside.Oil pulling - Google it - a bit weird, but you can do it whilst watching Will and Grace, so why not?And did I mention the smell...\n""]"

Trust me...I know...All in All:::This works better than all other lotions, salves, and even RX creams(like the one pictured next to coconut oil). Great  price too. Store in dark, cool place. I‚Äôve been living with Dry skin and Eczema my whole life(37 years) and my son 7 years. I‚Äôve tried it all behind the pharmacy counter and OTC.

I have big hair..  the first time in years I was able to go back to a blonde after bleaching.My hair has been so damaged that any bleach would not hold its color in my hair anymore.. My hair has been so chemically damaged and I needed something to really sink into every strand- my hair is porous and very dry.. I presumed it soaked it up like a thirsty animal.. I actually put it on my head with either dry or wet hair.. it's very hard in container- I scooped out a bunch and placed that in my microwave for a few seconds.. I left it on my head either overnight or for a few hours.. I had to wrap a plastic bag around my head because the coconut oil drips on your face, down your arms, your back... be careful washing it out..  I suggest in the shower and not the sink.. after all this is oil your putting down your drain and after 3 days of that my drain stopped draining- out came the plunger.I'd be careful not to let any drip around my floors... this is yummy and sweet coconut oil for any little bug to sniff out so be careful..it does wash out of your hair easily but  use a shampoo that's free of that sulfate and a coconut conditioner free of that too. After conditioning my hair it was the softest I've felt it probably in many years.. not even the salon ever got it that soft. Also.. it seemed to clarify my hair - the more days I used it the more my bad bleached dye job came out and the more my natural hair color came in.I also use folic acid supplements- that's suppose to be what gives our babies all their hair before their born. .. something along those lines...bottom line.... I'm so glad I read these reviews.. hope your glad you read mine.Good luck.\n"", ""\n  Awesome awesome awesome. Started using it 4 months ago religiously and only half of the tub is gone.Uses:1.

That's why I bought it and very happy with this purchase.

This is organic (one of the reasons I bought this one) and can be used for cooking and different baking recipes in kitchen.Most of the reasons for my rough hair:I was a little careless, so chronic use of chemical hair straighteners, coloring and other different hair manipulations like ironing and hot air blow drying made my hair lifeless and rough. At least twice a week, treatment with this coconut oil, helped me a lot. Hair shine and life is returning gradually.My special liking:It is collected through cold-pressed extraction method that I like.I want you to get a well informed decision before buying this coconut oil.

It is not made for cooking at higher heats (say a saut√©), but otherwise it is perfect for the cook that knows that you rarely need to cook anything on high anyway.

I remember everyone complimenting about my teeth when I used Viva Labs and no one really did the same when I was using Island Fresh.Also this brand is recommended when making DIY lotion. I live in Las Vegas so I need a lot of moisture! I used Island Fresh the first time to make DIY lotion and it is not as silky, smooth, and beautiful as Viva Labs. Island Fresh is only recommended for cooking (in my opinion).In addition, this brand's matter of state is consistent as well. Island Fresh is solid at all times (even above room temperature) where as Viva Labs turns solid when below room temperature and is at liquid state when it is above room temperature.

I use it for my hair, to oil pull, to remove makeup, and as a supplement. I've purchased this item twice before and, judging from the other reviews, it's a hit or miss. My past two times have been extremely positive experiences-- I received coconut oil that smelled nice and tasted normal. However, when I repurchased for a third time a few days ago, the coconut oil that I received was not fresh. The first thing I noticed was that there were tiny yellow dots on the surface of the hardened oil. At first I thought it was mold but thought no way. I used a fork to dig into the yellow spots, hoping that I was just imagining it, but further inspection revealed just pockets of yellowish oil. I've attached a picture but it was very apparent that there were two different colors of oil solidified into one. I know that yellow oil meant that the coconut oil was not fresh so I gave it a test try, and it straight up tasted like vegetable oil. Not faint nutty taste at ALL. I've been using coconut oil for about ten years now so I'm very familiar with what it should taste like, so this was a red flag. I also let the oil melt and it wasn't the whitish-clearish color that I'm used to-- it was slightly more yellow (like diluted vegetable oil).I also read in the comments how there were huge pockets of air in the oil--- Just as an experiment, I let the coconut oil melt and then refroze it again and, sure enough, the level of oil was considerably lower than it was before, indicating that there were pockets of air in the oil. If you feel the jar, you'll also notice that it feels very light.Again, I love coconut oil and have been purchasing from Nutiva for over three years. Very disappointed in this last experience, but have bought great quality coconut oil from them before.\n"", '\n  I‚Äôve been using this coconut oil to help with my dogs allergies. She‚Äôs been itching so bad she‚Äôs going bald in a few spots. I put this directly onto her skin in the places she itches the most. It did help but not as much as actually feeding the coconut oil to her did. So now I‚Äôm adding it to her food daily and applying the coconut oil to her fur at night. I‚Äôve been doing this for a month now and her fur is getting super soft and she itches so much less. UPDATE: her fur finally grew back!! Still feed this to her daily.\n', ""\n  I researched through web md first, which coconut oil is the number one product and it leads any high priced or medication to give all the benefits for your skin, hair, and health benefits. Well I made a list of the top 10. #1 was nutiva and by the second use my skin showed immediate results. I have skin cancer and b4 my recent diagnosis I started experiencing dryness, skin tone was changing my face within 5 yrs just was not at all what has always been. I say this because I was blessed with beautiful skin, tone, and glow. So I knew something was wrong but everyone else said your imagining it. Well using this product 5 days straight out of seven brought me relieve from actual pain and redness, discoloration, and what looked like small zits or rash. skin has gotten 60% better within a month. Obviously the area where the Carcinoma is what it is but that's 3inches of my body. The rest is about to be back 100% guaranteed.\n"", ""\n  I bought this because it was on sale but wont be buying again because the taste was awful. Does not smell or taste anything like coconut. Tastes like melted crayons. I will only be using this as moisturizer now. I will go back to buying the Spectrum brand for my Bulletproof coffee and cooking because this brand does not cut it. Though it says it's unrefined and virgin, it doesn't taste like it.UPDATE***** changed my review from a 2 star-to a 5 star!*****Amazon kindly sent me a different replacement jar and it tastes and smells completely different. Like actual coconut! My previous one seems to have been a bad batch or somehow got heated up during shipment and possibly spoiled. Highly satisfied with Amazon customer service and with the product now! Love that A-to-Z guarantee.\n"", ""\n  I recently discovered coconut oil has been used for skin care, and my face tends to get red from heat.  I'm super tired of using man-made, synthetic garbage that works for short periods of time; who knows how healthy that would be in the long run?! I had another brand of coconut oil, and while I used it for 2 consecutive days, its container didn't give much information on where or how it was harvested. I read the best coconut oil to use on skin was unrefined, cold-pressed, and expelled by the manufacturer. I found another brand that claimed they did this, but the price didn't match the amount given, and neither did the reviews. However, I came across this brand via the article I read explaining how to use coconut oil as a facial wash, and I was very impressed with the farm-to-table attitude the company has. Not only does it work wonders on my skin, but it smells outstanding and tastes terrific!  Although this process is still new to me, I'm loving the results. My face improved dramatically overnight, and it is extremely encouraging to want to continue every night. I cannot recommend this brand enough!\n"", '\n  Using as cooking oil, toast spread, moisturizer, cuticle oil, chapstick, shaving cream, and lube. I am now 12% coconut. Highly recommend.\n', '\n  I am in love with mine. It works super well for what I wanted it for. Better even than I expected. And it just smells delicious too.I am very into cutting all chemicals from the products I use on my body and making my own all natural products.This coconut oil is an essential element in a a few things I make, including my lip balms and shower gels.  And my shampoo and conditioner bars.Also worked so nicely (and smelt great) in the natural underarm deoderant I made.\n', '\n  I bought this specifically to use as a hair mask! It melts right in your hands and turns into an oil which is easy to apply to the hair. I guess this will be good for cooking too!Tip: I apply from the shaft down to the ends of my hair. DO NOT put in roots or they will be super greasy which will be difficult to get out. I leave the oil in my hair overnight (with a towel on my pillow) and rinse in the shower the next day. I shampoo twice to make sure hair is not greasy.\n', ""\n  I have been researching the benefits of Virginia coconut oil and was impressed with all the health benefits. I used a spoon to separate some of it into another pot for face cream. And the original pot to cook with.Beauty treatment. I use this every night on my face and im really impressed with results. My skin is a lot more toned looking, plumper and the fine lines are gradually reducing. My deep eye wrinkles are still there but a lot more less crepy. Wish I has bought this in my 20s rather than late 40s but still never too late. Before this oil I was trying all expensive brands to reduce the sunbed damage of my late teen life.I also just started using it on my son's face who has dry cracked skin that blisters. With its antibacterial benefits I'm sure it will help as no other cream has.Cooking- replacing existing cooking oil with coconut oil has benefits of reducing fat in the arteries and some report weight loss. Although I can't tell if that is happening I'm willing to use it daily (2 tablespoons recommended) as I don't notice a taste difference. I've used it for frying, replaced 1/2 marg/butter with coconut oil in recipes  etc.Just read the benefits of using coconut oil.The pot initially looked big but i'm thinking I need the gallon one now as use it for everything.\n"", ""\n  To set the scene my bathroom cabinet is groaning under the weight of lotions, potions, balms, creams, serums and anything else that I'm gullible enough to fall for in the beauty ailse that claims to make me look 15 years young, give me hair that would make Rapunzel jealous and the body of a 20 year old. I am a marketing persons dream - celebrity endorsement, I'm there.  Flash packaging, I'm there. Buy one get one half price, you get the picture...After reading about the benefits of coconut oil I thought, why not?  I have been the owner of this little jar of miracles for about 4 days and I love it.  The smell, oh the smell!! As a child of the 70/80's Bounty Bars were as near as I was going to get to a coconut - these were times when Findus Crispy Pancakes, Birds Eye Potato Waffles followed by a bowl of Angel Delight were considered a perfectly good meal for a 10 year old.  I digress. It smells fab.  I was a little dubious about being able to eat something you could also put on your face.  Being a brave woman, I stuck my finger in and gave it a go.  Taste is delicious.So far I've used it as:A lip balm - chapped dry lips gone within 2 daysMoisturiser - scaly lizard like shins are goneFace balm - very small amount at nightHair De-frizzer - again a very small amount to banish the candy floss look as soon as it drizzles outside.Oil pulling - Google it - a bit weird, but you can do it whilst watching Will and Grace, so why not?And did I mention the smell...\n""]"
