I was honestly surprised with the quality. It has some sort of coating on the bottle that make it feel really nice. There a clip on the handle that I use to slide my keys onto while I’m working out. There’s also a strap to help you hold it. I haven’t had it long enough to see if the lettering can get etched off, but so far so good.Update: I’ve have this for about 6 months and it’s still in really good condition!\n', '\n  The bottle is made of decent quality plastic with a internal straw that goes down to the bottom unlike many bottles. The best feature is the no touch drinking spout. You can open and close it without touching what goes in you mouth.It is easy to clean. Nothing to take apart, just wipe with soapy water, rinse and dry. There is a lock device that will prevent the spring loaded spout cover from opening by mistake. Good feature.We are very pleased with this bottle and would buy one again.\n', '\n  This is a great bottle for reminding you to drink and refill through the day. Love it!Word of caution. Have found that air pressure changes like flying or driving in mountains affects bottle and will cause water to shoot out of straw when lifted to drink (poor guy on plane seated I front of me, and my husband when we stopped in the mountains.)Fix: when using when air pressure changes, unscrew top to release pressure, screw back, then raise straw to drink.\n', ""\n  After receiving this bottle and cleaning it, I wanted to make sure there wouldn't be any chemical taste. I filled it and let it sit in the fridge for almost 24 hours. There was no chemical smell or taste. Also, the bottle will actually hold about 38 oz, because of where the 32 oz mark is. It is plastic so it won't keep your water cold for a long time. It is leak proof when the lid is closed. I laid it down while it was full, and no leaks. The only thing is I wish I would have gotten the cute sloth bottle instead of the plain one!\n"", '\n  I work at a hospital- In the two weeks I’ve had this water bottle, it has become an essential item. Keys, wallet, phone, badge, water bottle. The times on the side are easy to read and have a good feel on the hand, and are easy to translate to night shifts when I work evenings.The water bottle is sturdy and has several points at which to attach, including a wrist band and a carabeaner. The straw means I can drink from it while still wearing a mask (!!!). Plus, the slim design and ‘refill’ reminder means I get the benefits of having one of the ‘milk carton’ water bottles without having to lug one around.\n', '\n  i’ve never written a review for anything i’ve bought on here but i had to this time. this bottle is SO NICE. the quality is fantastic, it’s so easy to drink from and if you put an ice cold drink in it, IT DOESNT SWEAT. THERES NO CONDENSATION ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOTTLE.i work at a daycare and so it’s been beat up the last few days but it’s still in pristine condition. it also has a little lock for the button so that none of these little kiddos can get it open!\n', ""\n  I was looking for a water bottle to keep me on track with drinking enough water throughout the day, especially when I am busy at work. This is perfect for that! The color is wonderful, very vibrant and the two colors add a little something different with a slight frosted look to the outside. One aspect that I've enjoyed the most no condensation around the water bottle or water rings left where it was sitting. I went back and forth about getting one with a straw or not, but in reality the straw was the way to go because I can be busy on the phone or typing and still take a minute to grab a drink. The locking lid feature is just an added bonus.\n"", '\n  My favorite water bottle ever. I throw this thing in my laptop bag daily and have never had a leak issue. The reason for 4 star instead of 5 is only because of the lack of insulation on the cup. If I put ice in, it is melted within an hour, but I also live in fl. I know insulation would make it heavier so its probably best. Love the clear frosted exterior. Makes it easy not to worry about hiding mold or anything and ohmygosh the strap!!!! The arm strap is so perfect and easy to slip over ur wrist. Used this in all the theme parks this month and was so happy to have brought it. The straw was a little strange to get used to (thick tip, shorter spout) but i think it works better than the longer skinnier I had in a different one\n']"

My husband loves these as well so we got this one! The only thing I could say that would help things go better it is for the clip to have the ability to open and close so we can attach it to things easier but I love it.

There is an ""air"" area on the top that sometimes has minimal spillage.\n', '\n  I bought these for my son, who was too easily banging things with the metal Contigo bottles, including himself.  The plastic ones are lighter, better for school, and make less noise.  I got a great Amazon deal price on the set of three.\n', '\n  I have tried just about every make of autoseal bottles but none compare to the Contigo brand, they are by far the best spill proof autoseal bottles I’ve ever tried and they are so durable that I recently bought this set of 3 24oz bottles to replace my old set of Contigo bottles that I’d been using for 9 years. I am really pleased with the closing lid on the top of these new style bottles as it gives that extra security when carrying the bottle about.  I have absolutely nothing to complain about with this set of bottles and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this brand. You won’t be disappointed with this purchase.\n', '\n  Great product but terrible customer services from this seller.  Sold me a defective product and would not take responsibility for it.

My kids have increased their water drinking because they now think its a family goal to get the water to the next line in time.  Its very sturdy.  The straw is not as awkward as I expected.

So, if you get this just know you have to slide the lock button down first (which is ablittle tight) and then you can press the button in to pop the top open.

I have a dozen water bottles. When I saw this, I didn’t NEED it but it needed it lol.Here’s my feedback: I usually end up tossing a water bottle because I’m afraid of germs. Cleaning them properly can be a PAIN. This has a independent straw that breaks apart and doesn’t have nooks and crannies for mold and germs to hide. It’s different, and I was worried i would have to get used to it, but I actually love it.The straw is wide, which means I don’t have to work hard to get water out. Because the straw part isn’t sealed, air easily enters the bottle and you never struggle to get the water out. Also, sometimes the seal can make your bottle make weird noises as you drink. This does NOT help my social anxiety. This bottle will never have that issue.So now I was worried about the bottle leaking. But the top clamps down and seals it shut, the straw bends a little at the bottom so it gently pushes the straw down.The bottle size is large. But not obnoxious. My kids call it my “Chug Jug” (fortnite reference). It might be worth getting them a teal one 🙂. They do make a 128oz one that is HUGE. I ordered one and returned it because I know I wouldn’t realistically carry it with me.As you can see, it has an encouraging drinking schedule so that you address the barrier of chugging all of you water in the last two hours of the day. According to my PT, this is really, really bad for your bladder. If you have incontinence issues, chugging a lot of water at ones makes your bladder weaker and your incontience worse. This “kills two birds with one stone”. Plus spreading your water throughout the day helps your body. 🙂This particular bottle does not have the paracord, which is an option when you order. I regret not getting the paracord. The bottle I returned has the paracord and it makes carrying it super easy. I now have a paracord handle in my wish list, haha. What this bottle comes with is fine, but for me, I want the paracord. I regret not buying the paracord bc to buy one separate its at least another $7. I’ll survive but I wanted to let you know so you could avoid my mistake.\n', ""\n  This review is for you if you're like me and the only water you drank was in your morning coffee and maybe a glass with vitamins. That's it. I NEVER just drank plain water enough before this amazing water bottle came into my life! I was getting a little ache in kidneys and lightheaded when I would get up too fast, when I decided a can of La Croix at dinner wasn't enough hydration. The times of day and motivation on the bottle was what I figured I needed to make it like a game to keep sipping so I bought this in a gray color to make it not stand out too much. It kind of shocked me how big it was when I took it out of the box! But 64 oz. (8 glasses) is what they say you need and this jug makes it SO easy!I have drank the whole bottle, if not more (like 20 or more ounces) every day since I've had it, sometimes finishing water before the time calls for it because without thinking I will just pick it up and sip. It's large and if you have it on your desk, sipping just becomes a habit, and it's weird that the more water you drink, the more you want to do it. I'm changed forever! Look up articles about the benefits of drinking more water and they get better even a week, and months after you keep it up. This is the bottle to do that with!\n"", '\n  This bottle really does help me drink more water. I love that it has a daily water consumption tracker on one side and milliliters on the other side. This water bottle is pretty and I love the bright colors. I will say, the photo on amazon looks pink and blue but says it’s pink and green...it truly is pink and green. I love that a straw is included, however I am not sure what the white plastic piece is for... I thought it was a straw extender, but you can’t close the snap top if you use it. The rubber straw extender piece is nice, but you do have to grab it and lift it up to be able to use the straw since the snap cap pushes it down. The handle is awesome and makes it easy and comfortable to carry this bottle. This bottle is the perfect size..not too tall and not too wide. I can actually get my hands around it at the grip indentations. It fits in my civic’s deep bottle cup holder too 👌🏻.  Overall this thing is great, easy to clean, great material and very handy to have. My only true negative: it doesn’t hold ice or keep the water cold. Otherwise, this bottle is nearly perfect and everyone needs one.Edit to add:After months of use, I’ve discovered it’s less easy to clean than I originally thought. It seems to hold black debri in the mouth part opening and on the soft silicone straw part and cap piece. Scrubbing does not completely remove it 👎🏻\n', '\n  I was going to wait a while to see if the time/motivational quotes on the side of this bottle really did anything but it\'s been a few days and I already see a change. So first thing, the sayings are extremely corny... If you care more about staying hydrated than your water bottle telling you ""Keep Going!"" at 10 AM, you should most defimitely buy this. This bottle is soo pretty in the blue/pink color that I got. It has a handle around the mouth of the bottle which makes it easy to care and bring with you places regardless of the fact that it\'s a pretty tall bottle. The straw makes it extremely easy to drink. I have been drinking 2 of these a day without a struggle while typically drinking even 1/2 a gallon would take me the whole time. The time stamps make it easy to keep track where you need to be at what time so you\'re not left chugging the bottle at 9 pm trying to finish your half gallon for the day. I wish this was dishwasher safe but the mouth of it is at least big enough to put your hand and a sponge through to clean. Overall, I would highly recommend this bottle if you\'re trying to drink water consistently throughout the day!\n']"

It actually holds a gallon of water!!! It’s huuuuge so you don’t have to worry about this getting lost ever haha AND with the cute + encouraging drinking reminders on the side, it makes getting through an entire gallon of water feel way more doable to accomplish!!2. There’s a straw, ( that’s removable if you don’t like straws too), which makes drinking out of this thing a lot easier for me since it can be heavy in the beginning to lift up. Also straws make it more fun for me to drink... idk why either but it just is lol3. The cap is LEAKPROOF...AND IT LOCKS.I repeat: leak.proof. You can see in my video how that all works but it’s freaking amazing. I am prone to knocking things over and now I never have to worry about it.4. The strap is super secure and makes taking this big boy around soooo much easier. It can be buckled too so you can clip it to your bike rack or wherever so it doesn’t go flying around.5. The quality is superrrrr nice and sturdy.6. THE PRICE!!! So freaking affordable. Like how??7. It’s just cute as hell.The only couple things I will say about it is that it’s not dishwasher safe- however since I don’t have a dishwasher (curse you studio apartments!) that doesn’t bother me at all. Also it’s not insulted, but honestly... that would only add to the weight of a bottle this size plus for everything this one does, I don’t even care.I uploaded a video setting it up for the first time and my first impression... honestly I think it proves my points pretty dang well.I know this was long but I was honestly just so so impressed with this that I wanted to be as thorough as I could. Honestly, just get this bottle... seriously, you won’t be disappointed.\n', '\n  This water bottle is great! It is huge, but totally worth it if you have a goal of drinking a large amount of water in the day. I love this water bottle comes with a straw because it’s basically impossible to find a straw that would be long enough for it otherwise. I have another gallon sized water bottle at home, but it doesn’t have time markers on it nor does it have a straw. This one is better in so many ways! The paracord handle on this also makes it very convenient for taking with you since it is so big. It also gives me total mermaid vibes which I love! I definitely recommend this bottle! It’s already been great to have this during the Tennessee heat and will definitely come in handy throughout the summer!\n', '\n  This bottle is so fun! I HATE drinking water so I definitely don’t drink enough of it. With this bottle it’s hard not to drink a gallon!With the inspirational words I find myself determined to get to the next line down and before I knew it i drank the entire bottle!!This is a greatly made bottle too.The reusable straw it comes with is silicone and easy to clean. The lock on the lid is great so it practically spill proof!The handle is so thick it’s impossible to drop or break, which is always reassuring!I can’t wait to take this bottle to the beach!If you’re like me and need some motivation to drink more water, this is the bottle for you. It can be very intimidating at first because it’s so large but once you start sipping you won’t be able to stop! Buy it now... thank me later!!\n', '\n  I love this water bottle!!! I got the 1 gallon with fading color. The motivation to keep drinking is amazing, even if I don’t stay on track with time I know that if I finish drinking my water by end of day I met my goal of 1 gallon. Way easier than drinking glass cups.The heavy duty rope around it is just fantastic, I hook it to my baby stroller and go for walks no problem. If you want to make life easier with your water drinking, I highly recommend this product.\n', ""\n  I've been using my 1-gallon Fidus water bottle for about 2 weeks now. And I LOVE it!  When I first opened it, it was larger than I expected, but then realized hey, it's a gallon, it's gonna be large.  I was afraid it would be very cumbersome to move and carry around, but the paracord handle makes it a breeze.  You would never know you were carrying a gallon of liquid.The motivational sayings are great!  Especially when you are just a tad above that next line - it really does make you want to keep drinking to your goal. I love that the lid has a lock on it so the top doesn't accidentally pop open when carrying it.  The built-in straw makes it easy to drink as is, or if you are like me, I refill my thermal tumbler throughout the day.  And on top of that, it's soooo pretty!Another perk that I found that I hadn't thought of when I first purchased it, is it makes it very, very easy to carry around a gallon of water when I go kayaking or camping.  No more buying water bottles on the way.

REALLY I do. So, I bought the clear bottle on the left...the bottle has a cover I keep misplacing! I bought the second one (pink) thinking it had a spout on it. NO, it had a very wide mouth that was difficult to control one's drinking flow.  Finally, I found the third one (purple)...The Giotto Large Water Bottle with Leakproof flip top! It is perfect! Literally no leakage and NO CAPS!!! It is easy to drink from and the straw make is easy to control guzzle large amounts of water. I bought all three of these on Amazon. I would have saved a lot of money if I had purchased Giotto, to begin with. I highly, highly recommend it!\n"", '\n  I live the finish on the bottle! I hate holding wet water bottles and this does NOT sweat! It also holds two full bottles of 16.9 oz. packages water bottles so it’s very easy to get my full water intake on the go! Easy to carry, fits in my cars cup holders perfectly (not big at all like some water bottles). I got the ombré purple to teal and it’s very true to color. Easy to clean, wide enough for bottle brushes, and the straw stays put. I also love how I just push the little button by the mouthpiece and it just pops open quick for easy drinking (if you’re driving and don’t need to be messing around opening bottles😉). Highly recommend this water bottle. For the price, it’s amazing! Keeps my water cool for hours too.\n', ""\n  I like that this bottle has a soft touch feel and is labeled on the side which encourages you to drink throughout the day.  It's slightly taller than the water bottle I'm replacing. I like that you can remove the strap handle if you dont use it.  Also the bite valve is protected from dirt by a cover when not in use unlike my previous bottle. You dont have to worry about spills when you close it all the way because theres a latch that slips up and over the release switch to prevent from fully engaging it.\n"", '\n  I was hesitant about using plastic to store my water. I ordered a glass bottle first. But that one is a lot smaller and it leaks easily. Plus it doesn’t have a straw. My boyfriend ordered one of these, and I kept stealing his water. So I figured I’d better get one of my own. I’m glad that I did. The measurements help me drink water more frequently. So I am not is dehydrated as I was. I am not really the type of person who is thirsty a lot, so I forget to drink water. This is pretty large so as long as I drink one a day I’m doing good, And if I can drink two a day that’s even better. My boyfriend went to not drinking water hardly at all I think he’s up to about three of these a day. The water has an excellent taste even when it sits for a long time. We have a professional water purification system. The water taste great even days later, after it’s been sitting a while in the container. We actually ordered a couple of used to have in various parts of the houses. This way we’re always drinking water. We ordered some for the kids too. I recommend this. For us, it has been leak proof. Even when turned upside down. Also there’s never a smell inside the bottle. There’s really no need to wash it frequently. I do rinse it out occasionally, but I noticed that there’s never an odor inside the bottle. Anyway, that’s kind of an epically long review. I spent a lot of time researching this and I just want to take time to share my experience. Hope it helps someone else and makes someone else’s life a little easier in making a decision.\n', ""\n  I ordered this item and received it the very next morning. I love this bottle so much. I am not one to drink water when I'm thirsty, but I decided I needed to start drinking more and this is definitely helping me do that. The bottle is super cute, and I LOVE how it allows you to track your water intake throughout specific times of the day (makes it fun). It was a little hard to figure out how to drink out of the bottle at first. I was actually in the process of contacting the seller for a replacement because I thought it was defected, but while doing so I realized you do NOT have the turn the bottle up while drinking from the bottle just pick it up like you're sipping through a straw. Thank you so much!\n"", ""\n  This is already helping me to successfully reach my water goals for the day. I'm not sure that this bottle is more special that others that are on the market, but for my needs, I like that the bottle has two sets of markings. On one side you can see the ounces marked and on the other you see the hours. Having this sitting on the counter or on my desk reminds me that I need to complete one bottle before 1:00 PM and another by 7:00 PM. It isn't hard to pick it up and knock back 8 ounces quickly. I bought the blue, and I like it as it is bright and doesn't show fingerprints. It is easy to clean with a small OXO brush that I purchased separately. I wash it by hand each night so it will be ready for the next day.\n"", ""\n  If you're looking for a water bottle to help you drink your daily amount...look no further! This is the BEST! Before i got this i truly struggled to drink my daily amount (in fact, some days i forgot to even drink water!) and now, I'm doing awesome thanks to this water bottle! The straw makes it really easy to drink more water per drink. The closing mechanism works perfectly and is completely leak proof! The plastic of the bottle is thick and solid, feels of very nice quality, not cheap and thin. Even the wristlet which i thought i wouldn't need came in such handy, I'm so glad its there! I'm a teacher so when i walk into work my hands are FULL and it is so convenient to have that wristlet! I'm going to be purchasing more. Bottom line- If you're thinking about getting one of these because you want to drink the amount you should- do it. It's 100% worth it!\n"", ""\n  I'm loving this so much! I didn't think I'd care for the strap on it but I love it especially when I have a lot of things in my hands. I love the color. It's prettier in person. It fits in my cup holder perfectly with no issue. It holds 2 bottles of water exactly. The time marks on the side do help keep me on track with my daily water intake. It's a thick plastic and not flimsy. I usually throw it in my purse in the morning, full, and it doesn't leak. I do wish that the straw you sip out of were a little bit longer but it's not a deal breaker. In fact, I'll be ordering another so that I can swap my bottles out. I definitely recommend this one.\n"", '\n  La mejor botella que he tenido ! Me encanta todas y cada una de sus características\n']"
