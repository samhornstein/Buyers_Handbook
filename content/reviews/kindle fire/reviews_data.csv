I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 – 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 –8th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the “Saving Money on Purchases” section).This device is Amazon’s most recently refreshed (2019 – 9th generation) Fire tablet 7 inch at an outstanding price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is definitely slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are really tough to beat and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations.Below is my summary of the “Fire 7.” I have spent the past few days playing around with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review has overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience.-THE BOX: The Fire 7 tablet, a quick-start guide, basic safety instructions, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.- AVAILABILITY: Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage are the base colors variants. Additionally, covers can be purchased for $29.99 in the same color scheme as the Fire tablet from Amazon. Personally, I wouldn’t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other high quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better.- Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 model:--- Display size remains the same--- PPI remains the same at 171--- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM.--- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone)--- Size specifications remain the same--- Warranty remains the same (90-day limited warranty)- Summary of key aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017.---  Fire 2019: Increased storage options (16 GB or 32 GB) as compared to prior version Fire 2017 (8 GB or 16 GB).--- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from prior version.--- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019). This is a major plus because it would take forever to charge these tablets). Again, please note that this claim (regarding charging time) holds true only if an Amazon wall outlet is used. The tablet usually notifies you when you are using a non-compatible wall outlet and cable. I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging.--- The new processor based on specs provided by Amazon to developers Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 (1.3 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A7 (1.3 GHz)] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available.--- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version.--- Slight decrease in weight (0.3 oz/9 grams)--- Light sensor added (mentioned in developer information page).--- Three new colors added (Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage) in addition to Black.- Technical specs and other details:--- Size: 7.6” x 4.5” x 0.4” (192 x 115 x 9.6 mm).--- 171 pixel per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter. This basically means that there is a bright display with vivid colors and whiter whites for a great viewing experience from all angles.--- 7-inch screen, 1024 x 600 resolution with SD video playback--- Internal Storage: 16 or 32 GB--- External Storage: expandable storage using MicroSD card for up to 512 GB + unlimited cloud storage for Amazon digital content purchases.--- Weight: 10.1 oz/286 grams--- Amazon’s digital assistant: Hands-free Alexa enabled. This option basically converts the device into a stand-alone device that can do multiple functions. For instance, if you are cooking and want help, you can ask Alexa to pull up the instructions for “Mashed Potatoes” and it will do so.--- Warranty and Service: 90-day limited warranty and service included. U.S. customers can purchase an extended warranty for 1, 2 or 3 years (though I might not personally recommend this for such an affordable product like the Fire 7)--- Camera: 2MP VGA front-facing camera and rear-facing HD camera--- Sensors: Accelerometer and light sensor--- Battery life: Up to 7 hours of battery life--- Fully charges in 4 hours (if Amazon wall outlet is used)--- Single-antenna dual-band Wi-Fi. Uses 802.11a/b/g/n with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security using password authentication.  No support offered to connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) Wi-Fi networks.--- Bluetooth 4.1 LE--- Ports: USB 2.0 (micro-B connector) to connect to the computer or for charging the device with the included power adapter; MicroSDXC slot for external storage, and 3.5 mm stereo jack and integrated speaker.- Some limitations (to be expected because of this tablet being sold at a bargain price and also being the base model of the Fire series):--- No HD video viewing available--- Camera specs are sub-par as compared to other costlier tablets (again this might sound oxymoronic...but just pointing it out)--- Max volume is below average (because of the mono-speaker)--- Sound quality is average--- Amazon’s ecosystem is not as massive compared to the Google Play Store and Apple Play Store.--- Amazon’s Silk browser is not as intuitive and user-friendly as more prominent competitors (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.).--- Some reviewers have claimed that the external storage (MicroSDXC card) is not as responsive as the internal storage (this is not something I have experienced).--- Because of concerns dealing with volume and sound quality using this model for listening to music, or watching TV shows, movies, etc. might require headphones or a speaker.-Fire 7: 2019 Tablet Kids edition: Please note that Amazon has updated their Fire 7 Kids Edition too. Since, this is for a different audience, I will not deal with it in this review.- Comparison between Fire 7 (this version – 2019 release) and Fire HD 8 (2018 release – mid-tier model):--- Charge time: Fire HD 8 (6 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours)--- Display Size: Fire HD 8 (8 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches)--- Video playback: Fire HD 8 (HD video playback) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback)--- Resolution: Fire HD 8 (1280 * 800; 189 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI)--- RAM: Fire HD 8 (1.5 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM)--- Battery life: Fire HD 8 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours),--- Speaker: Fire HD 8 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker)--- Weight: Fire HD 8 (12.8 oz, 363 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g)--- Expandable Storage (internal storage remains same): Fire HD 8 (expandable by to 400 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB).--- Colors: Fire HD 8 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red, Canary Yellow) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage)--- Cost: Fire HD 8 (16 GB - $79.99; 32 GB - $109.99) vs. Fire HD 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99)--- Multi-touch: Fire HD 8 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)--- Processors, software version, and cameras remain the same on both units.- Comparison between Fire 7 (this version – 2019 release) and Fire HD 10 (2017 release – mid-tier model):--- Charge time: Fire HD 10 (5 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours)--- Display Size: Fire HD 10 (10.1 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches)--- Video playback: Fire HD 10 (HD video playback; 1080p HD resolution) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback)--- Resolution: Fire HD 10 (1920 * 1200; 224 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI)--- Processor: Fire HD 10 [2xARM Cortex-A72 (1.8 GHz), 2xARM Cortex-A53 (1.4 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 inch (ARM Cortex-A53 Quad-Core 1.3 GHz) (basically Fire HD 10 would be substantially faster than either the Fire 7 or Fire HD 8)--- RAM: Fire HD 10 (2 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM)--- Battery life: Fire HD 10 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours),--- Speaker: Fire HD 10 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker)--- Camera: Fire HD 10 (0.3 MP front-facing and 2 MP rear-facing camera) vs. Fire 7 (2 MP front-facing and rear-facing camera)--- Weight: Fire HD 10 (17.7 oz, 500 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g)--- Internal Storage: Fire HD 10 [32 GB (25.4 GB available to user) or 64 GB (54.1 GB available to user)] vs. Fire 7 [(internal storage remains same - 16 GB (9.4 GB available to user) or 32 GB (23.6 GB available to user)]--- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 10 (expandable by to 256 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB).--- Colors: Fire HD 10 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage)--- Cost: Fire HD 10 (32 GB - $149.99; 32 GB - $189.99) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99)--- Multi-touch: Fire HD 10 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)** If you are considering buying the Fire HD 10, I would wait on it as there is a high probability that this model will be refreshed this year as the last update was in 2017 (Amazon seems to follow a 2-year refresh cycle though this is not always the case).- Some useful features on Fire Tablets (not a comprehensive list)--- Accessibility: “VoiceView and Screen Magnifier enable access to the vast majority of Fire tablet features. VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.”--- Surfing the web using Amazon’s web browser - Silk--- Watching movies, TV shows and listening to music.--- Ability to read Kindle books.--- Ability to read the news using Washington Times--- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon’s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.--- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc.--- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store.- Testing:Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.- Saving money on purchasing the Fire:--- For users who want more storage, I would strongly recommend getting the Fire 7 (16 GB) and then purchasing a microSD card as opposed to getting the costlier Fire 7 (32 GB tablet). For context, users can get a 64 GB microSD card for around $12 (users might be able to get a cheaper microSD card on Amazon prime day) on Amazon which is cheaper than paying an additional $20 for Fire 7 32 GB. Additionally, the user gets more storage by getting a microSD card.--- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles the user to a ($10 app store credit value), so you are essentially paying $ 39.99 for the 16 GB Fire 7 tablet.--- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $49.99 (with special offers) or 32 GB Fire 7 for $69.99 (with special offers). Customers can disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Fire with special offers. Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 devices, all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the Fire with special offers and then remove the special offers..--- You can easily trade-in your prior Fire for Amazon credit (for $5-$15 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire.--- As previously mentioned, I would recommend avoiding purchasing extended warranty on this item.--- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.-Quality comment: Some customers have critiqued the prior version (Fire 7: 2017) for lack of long-term quality. Again, please remember that this product is sold for $49.99 and goes on sale for around $ 29.99. How much more can one expect for a product this affordable? I have used my prior Fire 7 (2015) for 4 years without any issues (Honestly, I am surprised it lasted this long). Additionally, it definitely is more durable than my iPad. Additionally, with the immense technological breakthroughs occurring at lightening speed, any tablet will be obsolete in a few years. So, it might be logically better to get an affordable average end tablet than investing in a high end one (unless you need a high-end one for your specific use).- Conclusion:To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, and potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, and basic app store.  Updates worth noting in this version include the new color options, a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and can complete most of the basic and some intermediate tasks along with basic entertainment, then this Fire tablet is the way to go. So, I am giving it 5/5 stars in spite of its limitations because it is really hard (if not impossible) to find a better deal at this price point.- UPDATE # 1 (June 10, 2019): Fire HD 8I would personally recommend the Fire HD 8 (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB vs. 1 GB), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the feature I appreciate the most - Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I own both the 7 and the 8 inch, and there is a spectacular difference in sound quality and volume between the two. Besides, most phones now have an average screen size of around 5.5 inches (many companies are moving towards a 6 inches average). So, having a 7-inch tablet might not per se make a major difference for customers because it is similar in size to their phone (unless they want to use this device as a back-up device to prevent wear and tear on their phone). Additionally, since charging takes a substantial amount of time, I would rather have a tablet with longer battery life (Fire HD 8) than shorter (Fire 7). However, please note that the last argument cuts both ways as the new Fire 7 (4 hours) charges quicker as compared to the Fire HD 8 (6 hours).- UPDATE # 2 (June 15, 2019): Amazon FreeTime Unlimited- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited ($2.99/month after free subscription period)--- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over “20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids' profiles to give them more access to apps and games.” “In FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.” Another unique feature is Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish!--- Parents also have the option “to set educational goals and curfews (using FreeTime Unlimited), and manage content for up to 4 child profiles (option given during initial set-up of the tablet) with easy-to-use parental controls.”--- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers unbeatable value – I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after trial subscription ends).*FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time.UPDATE # 3 (June 21, 2019):  Battery Life and SoftwareSome customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I have experienced occasional battery fluctuations (my prior Fire seemed to have better battery life). So, I am docking a star. Some other reviewers have also experienced overheating of this device. Other than the occasional overheating that occur in all devices (when complex programs/apps are used for an extended period of time), I haven’t experienced anything major until now. Additionally, some customers have also complained about the new Fire OS causing problems. I have experienced occasional staggering of the OS and app closures but nothing major as described by other reviewers. I will continue my testing to see if other issues surface but just wanted to give a heads-up to customers so they are prepared in case they experience any issues in the future and want to contact Amazon about it.Please also note several resources were used in the compilation of this review but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review. If you have any feedback or questions or corrections, leave a note in the comments section. Thank you!\n"", '\n  I having been buying the smaller Fire tablets (7 inch) since the beginning and I can now recommend to buy this tablet. I have other sized Fire tablets (8 Inch) and a new ipad, plus the new Kindle paper white, but the Fire 7 is my go to tablet. What I use it for. Prime Video, Hulu, Netflix, Youtube.  Kindle reader for books and bible. Audible books from audible. Podcasts (stitcher). Comixology for comics (old school Marvel fan!). Instagram (I do not use facebook). Home automation with Alexa (control of my lights, ring alarm, alarms, and basic questions) works great both hands free as well as pressing the home button.  I also play light games on it, Word search, Temple run, Angry Birds series of games, Yahtzee, Subway Surfer, Crossy Roads, and a few others.  I also listen to Amazon prime music (Apple music does not work on this device).  I mainly use my Apple air buds when watching and listening and it sounds fantastic.  Picture quality is great.  This is a snappy little tablet and my favorite size.  It feels good in the hand with the solid plastic build (compared to the Fire 8 inch, which feels more ""cheap""). It is a great tablet to use while lying in bed, which is mainly when I use it (ipad 9.7 is to heavy). I feel that Amazon finally got it right with this new 2019 version. The previous versions are painfully slow to load anything, and that is why I never would recommend them especially for a child.  These new tablets are so much better, my wife wants one, and I will be buying them for my kids, something I would not even consider before, because of the frustration of the slowness (and the reason my kids took over the ipad and iphones in the first place).  As you can see this is a consumption device, meant for fun..not a computer or workhorse.  I should mention you can check email and use the tablet for video chatting and dropping in on other echo devices which works really well and my kids have fun using it, I should also mention that I am a Prime member and take advantage of the Prime photo storage, which any picture that I take on my iphone, pops up on my Fire Tablet. I should also mention why I use this for reading more than my paper white, it is because I like the ""page curl effect"" and the way it highlights my passages on books (I still use my paper white..but this is just a preference). The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the 2mp camera (which I do not use much) and the battery life, which is actually not bad, but Amazon asked for a ""star"" rating on those two features as well as tablet as a whole.  At $50 you can not go wrong. Plus if you have a previous version, just trade it in. I got $10 knocked off and an additional 20% savings. I think I paid about $33.  I will be trading in my 8 inch Fire for this size as well.  Great little tablet!\n', ""\n  This kindle worked well for a few hours and then all of a sudden it started to search the internet on it's own.  This is for my 8 year old daughter because her old kindle was not working.  This kindle really scared my child.  She would play a game and something would control the game.  We would watch it change the settings on it's own and move from ap to ap.  When the kindle was locked something kept trying to access my contacts, and unlock my kindle!!  It would change the time and change to a different alarm.  I contacted amazon and they were not helpful, because nothing worked..  I had to factory restart it twice and it kept going back to controling itself on it's own.  Finally I just had to return it because it because there was no way to use it.  Amazon needs to make a product that works.\n"", '\n  Good budget tablet but the battery drains continuously when idle at a fast rate (10% daily)\n', ""\n  I'm not a fan. It doesn't hold an internet connection well AT ALL and I hate how limited the device is. I'm sure it's mostly my fault for not reading that the fire tablets are only exclusive to Amazon apps so you can't use any apps from Google play or anything, but in the part of the description I read it said games. I didn't realize it didn't include Google play games. Unfortunately that was my reason for getting a tablet, so I will be returning mine and getting something with Google play services. If you are okay with only watching movies, TV and reading, this may be okay for you. Not sure about the internet connection though, my boyfriend's tablet (Lenovo) doesn't do that.\n""]"

Speed and battery are great.  The QI wireless charging works like a charm.  The 3gb of RAM definitely shows in the use of the tablet.Here is my beef.  The trade in program is a joke.  They quote you $10 for the 8th Gen and when you mail it in they say that it didn't meet standards and reduce the amount to $5 and charge you the extra $5.  I don't know how mine didn't meet the standards.  It had a screen protector since day 1 and a case.  No scratches, not blemishes, full charge, wiped as ordered.  This seems to not meet their standards.  I have been hosed on their trade in program before trading in a Echo 1st Gen so you would think I would have learned my lesson.  Amazon gives you a joke of a trade in and then they cut that joke in half or all together and expect you to just grin and bare it.BE WARNED, DO NOT USE THE TRADE IN PROGRAM.  While I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon I will never promote their trade in program and I will voice my opinion anytime someone is thinking of using it.  Shame on you Amazon.\n"", '\n  Once again, a tablet billed as “all-new” is anything but.  I suppose if you are buying an 8” tablet for the first time, the new Fire HD models may be worth considering (although there are better deals and features from other manufacturers – see below).  However, if you’re thinking of an upgrade over your current Fire 8”, you may want to wait, or look elsewhere.Yes, the new Fire HD 8 and 8 Plus are somewhat faster than previous models – but previous models work just fine for almost everything we do with a small tablet: email, video, and web browsing.  The screen on the new Fire 8 is the same resolution and size as on previous models, even though the body of the new Fire 8 is now wider (which means you’ll need a new case, too).So what do you get for $89 or (for the Plus) $109?  You get a USB-C connection, and a modest speed increase. That’s it.  There is nothing here that defines the new Fire 8 as “all new.”  This tablet is billed as “allowing you to enjoy your favorite apps,” but you could already do that with previous models.  And the heavily-touted battery life of 12 hours?  That’s the same claim Amazon made for the Fire 8 in 2018!A truly useful step would have been an upgraded screen, but we don’t get that feature on the Fire 8.If you are eager to get a new 8” tablet, you may want to consider other products.  For instance, the new Lenovo Smart Tab M8 costs $99, but for the extra $10 you get a tablet with the same size screen, RAM, and processor speed as the Fire 8, but the M8 is physically smaller, lighter, has a metal body (instead of plastic like the Fire), and ships with smart charging dock for no additional cost.Someday, Amazon will create a tablet that is indeed “all new.”  Today is not that day.\n', ""\n  The tablets fine, no problems there.  But where are the cases?  Accidents happen and how many times have you seen people drop their smartphone/tablets and the screen cracks?  I know we're going thru corvid-19 right now, but there is no mention on the webpage how Amazon is going to address this.The one case listed on amazon has the access for the camera, power and volume buttons in the wrong place.\n"", ""\n  It is well known that the HDX was the holy grail of Fire tablets. I have been a Fire user since gen 1 (which I recently traded in for the new HD 8 Plus), but the HDX was the epitome of an inexpensive, quality Android tablet. It was speedy, reliable and had a great screen. I used mine so much that the battery died and I replaced it just so I could keep using it, even after Amazon stopped updating apps for it. When I decided to upgrade to the HD 8 (8th gen), I was so disappointed. The HD 8 is trash. It is an embarrassment. It doesn't even run Amazon products like Alexa or Music properly, and the browser runs so slow to be almost unusable.  When I stumbled on the new HD 8 plus, I decided to replace the HD 8. Finally, a worthy successor to the HDX! As you can see from the image I uploaded, it finally nudges out the 7-year-old HDX in speed, but better yet, Amazon supports all the apps and it runs great. Finally, a snappy browser, reliable email, and (check this out), it actually runs the Amazon Music app without crashing! It's a steal at a hundred bucks.\n"", '\n  I like the build and over feel of the device. Even though it is made out of plastic it still feels very rugged and durable. I recommend this product. I have had a Kindle before and it is still in perfect condition.\n', ""\n  I purchased this as a long overdue replacement for my 4th generation Fire HD 6. I primarily use my Fire tablets as Kindle devices because I'm a fan of the text-to-speech functionality. (Did you know you can also ask your Alexa Echo devices to read your Kindle books to you?) Aside from the improved specs in the new 2020 10th Generation version, I was especially looking forward to being able to Alexa in Show mode without having to be tethered to an outlet - this functionality alone is well worth the product price IMO. The Fire HD 8 tablet is a great choice for people who want to read or listen to Kindle books, watch streaming video content (Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, YouTube, etc.) or casually browse the internet. Both of my Fire tablets have had the 'Special Offers'; they don't bother me at all.Favorite Features:- Amazing Battery Life!!- Alexa 'Show Mode' - like having a wireless Echo Show!- Text-to-Speech functionality for Kindle- Expandable Memory up to 1TB- Dolby Speakers = decent sound quality- Has a 3.5mm Audio Jack- 3GB RAM & Wireless Charging (Plus model)- Angreat 10W Wireless Charging Dock (sold separately) is well-designedA few minor gripes:- I wish the included charging cable were longer, but I ordered a wireless charging dock- It would be great if the 'Plus' model came in more colors- Camera quality could be improved- Fingerprint Magnet- Google Play Store not included by default\n""]"

When you buy Amazon tablets, it should be known you’re NOT getting an Android tablet. You’re getting Fire OS. But, you can still get Google apps on this tablet by downloading an APK of the Google Play store (which doesn’t root it or mess with warranty). It was between the Fire 7 or this one, & I opted for the extra price for more storage, better screen, & bigger size. I bought this tablet at Best Buy to take with me on the go rather than my iPad Mini. This is an amazing little thing. It runs fast, has a decent screen, is responsive, & has a great battery life. Yes, it has ads on the lockscreen, but they don’t bother me. I use this tablet for drawing & it actually is very good for it. I also use it to watch YouTube videos, although the speaker is extremely weak (not a huge trade off for me, I use headphones the majority of the time). Bluetooth connects great. Has a decent display, could be better, but it’s a budget tablet. You could technically get 2 Fire 7s for the price of this, but this is worlds better. I see no reason to go to the 10 inch unless you want a bigger screen. This is a great tablet. Absolutely nothing to complain about except a subpar speaker.\n', ""\n  People who complain about the Amazon Fire are really just complaining that it's not a traditional tablet. They wanted an iPad or a Galaxy Tab, but didn't have the money or were too cheap to get one and for upset when they realized what they'd bought. If you understand what the Fire is, an Amazon digital content delivery device with some tablet capabilities, you'll be thrilled with what it can do. If you're trying to find a cheap version of a Samsung or Apple tablet, keep looking because that is not what this is and you'll just be disappointed.\n"", ""\n  \xa0I enjoy reading books and watching videos on my new Kindle.- Screen and Size:I appreciate the form factors -- it has sufficient screen size for my use but also very portable to carry around. The display quality of the 8 inch screen is great, everything is crisp and sharp. For me it is the most important thing. It's a great content consumption device which provides excellent reading experience similar to my old Paperwhite.- SpeedThe marketing material says 30%. Honestly it doesn't matter for my use.It is smooth enough for web browsing.- Battery Life:It claims up to 12 hours of battery life, which impressive for tablet this size.Based on my initial impression, it is probably true.\u2028I will come back to update this review later about my real-world usage.- ChargingType-C port! No more micro-USB!According to the specifications, charging time is 5 hours.Get a more powerful charger and I think this regular HD 8 will charge up just as fast as the more expensive Fire HD 8 Plus, if not faster!In my video review, I used a type-c PD charger that delivers 14.12 watts of power when the tablet is around 68% battery. With the included charger, it was only able to deliver 5 watts. I won’t be surprised it can be charged from 0 to 100% under 3 hours!- Storage:It supports 1TB of additional storage!

Did amazon go full on proprietary on us with this latest generation?  One star until we get this sorted out... Will update the review if there\'s a solution.  If no solution, it will be returned.***update #1*** There\'s apparently no simple solution.  Anmolpreet, the customer service guy, was trying to walk me through some complicated email method that was highly impractical.  Why does amazon feel the need to take a simple data transfer by USB method and remove it?  What a terrible design flaw!  Why does amazon hate their customers?  This is right up there with not being able to open .mobi files from the micro SD card with the kindle app.  I\'ve learned to live with that flaw, but this one is ridiculous. Stay away from this lump.***update #2*** amazon\'s Seattle based customer service contacted me and provided a workaround.  You can select the functional properties of the USB cord.  It can be used both to transfer data and charge the device.  Unfortunately, amazon\'s incomplete instructions provided with the tablet do not provide this level of information.  Work on it and make sure your overseas tech support guys know how to fully assist a customer with the proper countermeasures.  Adding another star to the review to bump it up to 2.  Hopefully, there aren\'t any other problems.\n', '\n  We bought this kindle for my son this past Christmas and the screen glitches. Whenever it’s turned on every few seconds the screen will go black and then turn back on. It doesn’t matter if it’s on the home screen or in an app. My son tried to use this kindle many times during “homeschooling” and it would not work. Because of COVID it took me awhile to get to costumer service as this problem has been going for a few months. Once I was able to talk with someone they told me that because it was purchased through Target they are not responsible for replacing it. This doesn’t make since to me as it’s an amazon product.Years ago I had a problem with my iPad. I contacted Apple not the store that I purchased it from (which was also Target). They spent time on the phone with me and tried to fix my device. When they couldn’t they sent me a new device since the iPad wasn’t even a year old.I guess you get what you pay for and I payed for junk and received crap costumer service. I know we’re I’ll be purchasing my kids next device from. I would give this Kindle 0 stars and Costumer Service a 0 rating as well for not even trying to trouble shot the problem. I wonder if I call Target if they have techs to help determine the problem.

I also love that if there’s an app that’s not in their age group but we still want them to have it, we can download it and put it on their profile. It’s nice that we have a PIN number that allows us to get in the settings, and also lets us use it as a normal tablet. The cases it comes with are great and sturdy! We love the free time. Can’t say enough good things about these! Watch for when they go on sale and grab them, you won’t regret it.\n', '\n  My daughter absolutely loves hers. She had it for a year.

So no port damage since the plug is NEVER removed.\n', ""\n  My kids (age 5 and 2) sometimes take my phone to play games and watch videos so we bought them each a Kindle Fire to use during their screen time.  The 5 year old plays the games and listens to the stories on it but my 2 year old can't use most of the preloaded content.  Both of my children like Kids YouTube and that can't be put onto these so they still like to get my phone whenever possible.\n"", '\n  I bought these for the grand children to cut down on the fights over the xbox. Peace at last! In fact the xbox has lost its place of importance in their lives.The only down side that I have noticed is that one of the tablets has trouble connecting to the wifi.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND a Fire 7 AT ALL if your looking for a quality tablet that’s small and inexpensive like I was.  The only reasons I can see anyone buying a Fire 7 is if it’s for a very, very young child as a starter tablet or if your an adult who will only use it to read books.  Otherwise the Fire HD 8 is going to be your best bet.The Fire HD 8 is great quality for it’s size and yes even it’s price.  It’s the perfect size unlike the Fire 7 which to me really isn’t much larger in screen size than my iPhone 6+.  The Fire HD 8 comes with an ample amount of storage to be able to handle whatever updates it throws at you upon setup, and that’s just the 16GB.  Anything below 16GB is not enough to handle device updates and allow for storage space for much of anything.  There’s not much money saved either in buying a Fire 7 8GB with a micro SD Card, been there, done that and I won’t do it again!Now onto the fun stuff.  The Fire HD 8 is HD!  It has a longer battery life, downloads faster, has better sound quality and video quality than the Fire 7.  It’s also easier to start up a game and actually play it than the Fire 7.  Everything that is possible to do with a Fire HD 8 Tablet is much more fun and less time consuming than a Fire 7.  I highly recommend the Fire HD 8 Tablet if aside from reading, gaming and watching videos is also as important.The only problem I have encountered with both Fire Tablets is their very finicky Location Services.  I would have given the Fire HD 8 Five Stars if the Location Services worked better and therefore enabled me to restore from a backup.  I will always have to setup as a new device every time I upgrade a device because it takes this brand tablet almost 24 hours to find my location if it even ever does?!With all of that being said I highly recommend the Fire HD 8 Tablet.  Although it’s no iPad by any means.  At times I find myself forgetting what device I’m on and that speaks volumes!  If you’re like me and enjoy utilizing everything a device has to offer, this one is the only way to go for it’s compact size, the quality and the price!\n', '\n  I really wanted to like this tablet. I have many friends who have the Kindle Fire and they love it. I had high hopes but so far I\'m not loving it. I stayed at a friend\'s house a month before the newest edition came out. She has 3 Fires, all different sizes. I played on hers and liked them. So much that I was sold on buying one. I decided to get the newest one since it was due out in 3 weeks. The problem I\'m having is it\'s incredibly slow. It takes almost a minute and a half to open the screen from the lock. When it finally does it takes another 45 seconds to a minute to load the apps. That may not sound like a long time but for a tablet it\'s an eternity. A brand new one at that. I tried to open Amazon store to review this Fire and it sat on a white screen for 3 minutes and 17 seconds. Yes, I timed it. Once the Amazon logo showed up it was another minute before the rest of the page loaded. Then I clicked on the menu to pull up my orders and it remained unresponsive. I put it down and picked up my phone to leave this review. As I type this it still has not accepted my command and is frozen. I don\'t even have a lot loaded. Most apps on it are the ones that come hard coded on it. I\'ve been trying to give it time to see if it will get better but I\'m tired of fussing with it. There are times it works just fine but most of the time it\'s very, very slow. IF I decide to get another one, I\'m going one generation down. This one is not great. I\'m beginning to think I may have gotten a dud but then I read other reviews and it seems this generation is struggling. Very sad because I wanted to like it. It\'s back to Samsung for me.UPDATE: First I want to say Amazon\'s customer service is absolutely top notch! I received a phone call from them about 10 minutes after leaving this review. They did not try to ""sell"" me on keeping it nor did they patronize me and ask me to trouble shoot. I did inform them I had done all the basics of rebooting, factory reset, etc. There had apparently been an update that got stuck and didn\'t fully complete. I completed it with his help and he asked me to give it a couple days. I did. Again, I had hoped that was going to fix the problem. Sadly, it didn\'t. I received a follow up call from them a few days later and I told them I was still having the slowness problem. They graciously offered for me to return it and they would refund me. Overall, though I was sad to have to return the Fire, Amazon made the experience better with jumping into action.\n', ""\n  I got my Fire HD 8 on release day and set up was a breeze. I side loaded the Google Play store (check Youtube, it's easy) and installed my favorite Google apps, Youtube, Google Play Music, Google 1, Google Drive,Google Docs and a slew of other apps I like from the Play Store that Amazon's app store does not provide and I'm loving the tablet. It's no speed demon but for the price I wasn't looking for cutting edge technology. I also bought the cover and the docking station and switch between the two easily as I retire to my bedroom for the night. I previously was using a Fire 6 tablet and a Samsung Galaxy tab S3. The Kindle Fire 6 was great for it's size and the Galaxy Tab was great (older now, less reliable battery life due to age) for the same reasons but this Kindle Fire HD 8 blends the best of both worlds for me regarding size. It's a nice companion to have near, lets me use the apps that I like, moderate gaming, lots of reading and now having both Amazon Music and Google Play Music, a slew of options for music. If you are looking for a workhorse you're better off with your iPad or mainstream Android tablet . If you are looking for a nice reliable multimedia hub, look no further than this tablet. The price is on point for the features it has provided thus far and I am happy with my purchase. it is a great middle of the road tablet and the price it can't be beat. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because there is nothing revolutionary about this tablet. It's not a must have by any means but it fits the casual niche perfectly.\n""]"
