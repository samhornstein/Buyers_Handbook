Upon clicking, I was presented with an option to receive a smart bulb along with the Alexa. I had never tried one so I opted for this option to see how things work. I do already have a few smart plugs from TP-Link so I was kind of excited. Well, the buld came first. It was delivered fast. The echo, however was backordered or delayed... which i was ok with. My only upset was that I could not use the Bluetooth bulb without the echo as i do not have a hub or other bulbs. So I had to wait to use it. After receiving the echo, i followed the instructions for the bulb and it works as expected. Just make sure you have it in the vicinity of the echo as it connects directly to it. It is bluetoothed to the echo so i have to use the Alexa app to control it. Unlike my WiFi plugs which i can control with the plugs app, Google, alexa. And FYI the bulb is just plan white. It does not change color.\n', ""\n  Can't get it to work the right way it's I need all these apps and then when you get on the app you got to buy into getting it to work and all that plus you got to buy what the price that's on the thing it's hard to get them to work and like you can got a lot of money to get it to her where you can buy into the apps and things\n"", ""\n  Works as good as if not better in most respects than the 4th generation and comes with a matching color power cord.  Sound quality and volume are better on the 4th gen and there are a few added features on the 4th that I find do make it better (I like the power saving) but nevertheless I don't find either one to be good as stand-alone music speakers.  At best if you pair them it's not so bad.  The midrange and bass are poor and even the treble is not great, a little muffled.  Adjusting the mids and bass using the Alexa app helps a little but the more you add the more distorted it sounds and you get a blown speaker effect at higher volumes.  I'm rating this 2 stars for sound based on the full price for them.  I think these are really meant music-wise more for adding a layer of sound paired with better speakers like the Echo or the Studio devices or plugged via the auxiliary output or Bluetooth into good speakers or a receiver but if you use them more for podcasts or music without much bass or midrange it's a fair price at the sale price of $24.99 or the even better package deal with the smart bulb (which as it turns out doesn't work when you unplug your Dot even using the Alexa app but that's another review).\n"", ""\n  The alexa app caused my iPhone 12 Pro to overhead and die while trying to setup Alexa.

That's really the only thing I think it was missing.\n"", '\n  I\'ve been a happy owner of a 2nd generation Echo and three 2nd generation Echo Dots for a year now, and I was glad to add this to the arsenal.  After using it for a few days I am generally pleased with it, but it does have limitations, especially when it comes to sound quality (no surprise there!).  I will start by summarizing what\'s new about the 3rd Generation Dot, then I\'ll describe the device in more detail, and finally I\'ll add some thoughts about how to choose which Echo device may be best for you.The most obvious update to the Dot is the new look: it\'s as if someone took a 2nd generation Dot, inflated it with an air pump, and wrapped the edge in fabric.  And it\'s not bad!What\'s different/updated in the 3rd Generation Dot:1) It is slightly larger than the 2nd generation device, measuring 3.9"" wide x 1.7"" tall (2nd gen was 3.3"" wide x 1.3"" tall), and the top and bottom edges are more rounded.  It is also substantially heavier at nearly twice the weight of the 2nd generation model.2) The 2nd generation Dot came in two color options (black and white), each of which had a shiny plastic exterior that I personally thought looked a little cheap.  The 3rd generation Dot has a fabric exterior which gives it a classier appearance, and it\'s available in three colors: heather grey, sandstone, and charcoal.  The fabric and rounded edges give the 3rd generation Dot a much softer look than its predecessor.4) The 3rd generation Dot has a larger speaker (1.6"", versus 1.1"" on the 2nd gen), which is paired with a larger driver as well.  I\'ll talk below about the effect this has on audio quality.5) The placement of the microphones is slightly different: while the 2nd generation had seven small far-field microphones on its top surface; the 3rd generation has four microphones.---------------------------Overall appearance---------------------------I purchased the ""sandstone"" version. The cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades which gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray. The neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives the unit a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you don\'t want something that screams ""I\'m a device!""Aside from its larger size and slight convex bulge, the top of the device is nearly identical to that of the 2nd generation Dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an ""action"" button) and a multi-colored light ring around the top edge that tells you about the Echo\'s status.  The side of the device has an input for the power cable and a 3.5-mm output jack.One notable improvement is the shape of the power cable, which sits flatter against the wall than the 2nd generation Dot\'s cable (see my photo to see them side by side).  This may sound like an insignificant change, but it makes a huge difference if you want to plug the cable into an outlet that is behind a piece of furniture.-------------Setup-------------Setting up the Dot couldn\'t be easier.  You simply plug in the power cable, then use the Alexa app on your phone to connect the Dot to your WiFi network.  The app leads you through everything, and the whole process takes less than a minute.  Boom.----------------Audio----------------I did a side-by-side audio comparison of the 2nd and 3rd Generation Echo Dots, first with music (orchestral, a jazz combo, and some AC/DC) and then with a few newscasts.  Everything does sound better on the 3rd generation Dot, but to be honest, the sound is still pretty anemic.  Compared with the 2nd generation Dot, the sound is slightly fuller, not as annoyingly tinny, and has a small amount of bass presence (not much, but the 2nd generation had none).  Newscasts and other spoken texts benefit from the fuller sound as well, but the difference is more pronounced with music.  Just for fun, I also compared the 3rd generation Dot with my 2nd generation Echo, and THAT\'S where I noticed a big difference.  Yes, the new Dot sounds a bit better than its predecessor, but they both sound weak compared to the full-sized Echo.  (To its credit, Amazon doesn\'t claim that the Dot has room-filling sound.)I\'ll be blunt: I really like the Dot, but I don\'t use it to listen to music.  At all.  With so many other speaker options out there, there\'s just no reason to use this as your primary music device.-------------------------Voice recognition-------------------------As I mentioned above, the number of microphones on the top surface has dropped from seven to four.  I\'m not sure what the rationale for this was, but after testing the Dot\'s ability to pick up my voice from different distances and angles, I didn\'t notice a substantial difference in the overall microphone sensitivity compared to the 2nd generation Dot.  Like the other Echo devices, though, it seems to have more difficulty detecting voices that come from below it (which happens if I talk to it while I\'m on the floor playing with my daughter).-------------------Functionality-------------------The bottom line is that the overall functionality -- what the 3rd generation Dot ""does"" -- is nearly identical to that of the previous generations (and of other Echo devices, or at least the ones without screens).  This is largely because the Alexa assistant software on which all Echos operate is run on Amazon\'s cloud, not your individual device.  This means that as Amazon adds new features and updates to Alexa they automatically become available on all Echo devices.  So, you can use any of them to:- Stream music via WiFi from multiple sources- Control smart home devices with your voice- Make hands-free calls to other Echo devices or phone numbers in North America- Make purchases from your Amazon Prime account- Listen to news feeds, podcasts, etc.- Do anything else in Alexa\'s ever-growing skill set, such as make shopping lists, set timers/alarms/reminders, play games, tell you your daily schedule, and any other skills Amazon dreams up for Alexa in the future.If you don\'t want to use the Dot\'s built-in speaker, you can connect it to your own speakers via Bluetooth or by using the 3.5-mm output jack.One new feature for the 3rd generation Dot is a little puzzling to me: You can pair two Echo Dots in a ""stereo mode,"" giving you essentially left and right speakers.  I tried this briefly and the results were pretty much what I expected: yes, it\'s stereo, but it\'s still weak sound!  You can also pair an Echo Sub with the Dots, creating a little 2.1 sound system.  Frankly, I\'m not sure why you would do this; if I were setting up for stereo sound, I would want speakers that are designed for decent audio performance, not two Echo Dots.Alexa\'s skill set is enormous and always growing.  In fact, part of the fun of owning an Echo device is seeing what new skills Amazon comes up with (even if many new skills are just silly or entertaining).  I\'ll mention two of my favorite skills here: the Flash Briefing and the drop-in feature. The flash briefing is fully customizable daily digest of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking ""What\'s my flash briefing?"" There is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining. Using the Alexa phone app or your Echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it. For example, I configured mine with news feeds from NPR, BBC, and Reuters. I love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources.My other favorite feature, ""drop in,"" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two Echo devices, sort of like an intercom. Simply ask Alexa to ""drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]"" and you are instantly connected. My wife and I use this feature to communicate from opposite ends of the house. You can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your Echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with ANY Echo device or only those in your own home.[Note that the drop-in feature is NOT the same thing as Alexa\'s hands-free calling feature. Hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and Echo devices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from your Echo by saying your contact\'s name or number. Just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate. By contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established. For this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!]-----------------------------------A few (minor) complaints-----------------------------------Unfortunately this 3rd Generation Dot shares an annoying trait of its predecessors: widely varying volume levels within the daily Flash Briefing. As you listen to the briefing, some components (such as BBC News) come through quietly while others (like Reuters) are much louder.  Not a deal-breaker, but slightly annoying.Also, occasionally when Alexa misunderstands a command, you have to ""start over,"" which can be really irritating.  For example, if Alexa thinks you asked to turn on a light but you really asked something else, she will repeatedly say ""In which room?"" until you say ""Alexa, stop"" and then start over.  I\'m guessing this type of thing will improve over time as voice recognition software  becomes more advanced.  This is really more of an Alexa issue than a Dot issue, but it drives me nuts at times.Finally, I wish the Alexa phone app was easier to use.  It works, but its organization is not intuitive and it feels rather clunky to navigate.  Again, this is more of an ""Alexa"" issue than a ""Dot"" issue, but still... Hopefully Amazon will continue to make improvements to it!--------------A few tips--------------1) The Dot seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits). Mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so I don\'t recommend placing this on a high shelf.2) When you select news feeds for your Flash briefing I recommend picking one U.S. source and one international source (I use NPR and BBC - both are excellent). If you add too many feeds you\'ll get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times.3) If you have multiple Echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms). One way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to ""Echo"" or ""Amazon."" The only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device!------------------------------------------------------------------------Echo Dot vs. Echo vs. Echo Plus: Which one to buy?------------------------------------------------------------------------(Please note that I am only comparing Echo devices that do NOT have screens.)When choosing between the Echo Dot and one of the larger Echo devices, perhaps the most important question to ask is ""How much do you plan to LISTEN to the device?""  This question is important because one of the biggest differences between the Echo Dot and the larger Echo devices is sound quality: the 1.6"" speaker of the Dot simply cannot match the fullness and heft of the Echo or Echo Plus.  (Remember, they all run on the same Alexa software, which means they all have nearly identical skill sets!)So, if you don\'t currently own an Echo device, start by thinking carefully about how you plan to use it.  Many Alexa skills fall into one of two broad categories: those that rely heavily on the speaker and those that don\'t.  For example, features that benefit from good sound quality include playing music/newscasts/podcasts, the drop-in feature, and hands-free calling.  (This is why I chose an Echo Plus for my kitchen - I use it every morning to listen to the news.)  If you plan to use your device largely for these type of features, you would probably appreciate the better sound of the Echo or Echo Plus.On the other hand, if plan to use the Echo mainly for ""non-listening"" purposes such as voice-controlling your smart home devices, then the sound quality isn\'t as important and a Dot is probably all you need.  In fact, you could even save some money by purchasing a 2nd generation Dot instead -- especially if it\'s not going to be in a highly visible location or you don\'t mind its shiny plastic look.  I have several ""single-purpose"" Dots in my house in rooms where I want to voice-control one thing, such as a lamp in the room, and 2nd generations Dots are just fine for this -- and now that their price has gone down they are a great value!==========Bottom line==========The Echo Dot is an extraordinarily useful and versatile device -- one that becomes more useful all the time as Alexa\'s skill set expands.  The 3rd Generation model has a great new look, but despite marginal improvements in the speaker, it\'s still pretty unsatisfying as a playback device for music or  newscasts.  As long as you are willing to accept its acoustic limitations, the Dot can be a wonderful device to have in your home.  And if you DO want better sound quality for the features you use most often, you can always connect the Dot to your own sound system via Bluetooth or the 3.5-mm audio jack.  Hope this was helpful!\n', ""\n  I have 5 Echo Dots (gen 2) and we use them throughout the house for just about everything, being we have a fairly smart home. What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and being that they used a fairly standard USB interface for the power, you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality.Enter the Gen 3...I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger and has a much more rounded shape. While it makes it look better by itself, it lacks the ability to really customize it. It surely would not work as a power socket mount, like you could do with the gen 2, just due to the additional weight.That is before you get to the horrendous power cord and adapter. The power adapter is twice as big as the gen 2 and the power cord went away from the, easy to find, usb style cord to a old style input style and it is permanently attached to the power adapter. This is really my biggest complaint as it took away so much flexibility, that you could enjoy with the gen 2. Don't get me wrong, I am sure there will be several new cords and adapters put out to fill the gap, but that is not as easy as using cords many already have. Just makes no sense. Not to mention the cord is really long, so in areas where you want it to be a bit more discreet, this thing sticks out like a sore thumb.What I like...Sound Quality is a step upSound Volume is much improvedBase look is much improvedWhat I dislike...Much less flexibility on how it is used versus previous versionNon-standard power cordBulky adapterUgly long cord\n""]"

This one came with a free Sengled light bulb that ended up in the garbage because it just would not work at all.  No connectivity, no light, no nothing.  I see why it was a free add-on.\n"", '\n  I have a couple gen 3 dots, one of which was in the bedroom next to the bed along with a clock radio.  Since the echo dot can play any radio station and set an alarm the clock radio was used only as a clock.  So, decided to try the new 4 with the clock.  Admittedly, I was a little hesitant given some of the reviews regarding voice recognition and brightness (one person said it was way too bright at night).  Plugged the new Echo Dot in and it immediately connected to my Alexa.  No problems with voice recognition.  As to the brightness, that fluctuates relative to the amount of other light available.  Most importantly, when all the lights are turned off at night, the echo dot dims to soft readable display - certainly not the beacon one reviewer implied.  Very happy with it and I got a smart light bulb thrown in for free.\n', ""\n  I got this for my senior mom so she doesn't have to walk in the dark or try to reach for a light switch in her wheel chair. She now doesn't have to look for her glasses, cell or remote in the dark. If she hears a noise in the dark, she doesn't have to feel for the lamp anymore. She just tells Alexa to turn her light off and on. She loves her Alexa echo clock. My mom can ask her anything and Alexa has the answer. What a great gift it is for her. I got my brother one so my mom can use Alexa to wake him up if she needs help. He can use his to also check in on her when she is home alone.\n"", '\n  I already had new Echo Dot that purchased on sale over holidays.  I bought this for the opposite night stand.  Paired easily using the Alexa app.  Brightness was a little dim for my liking.  Found the device in Alexa app, easy to lighten or darken the LED read out.  The LED will show a timer ask to wake in 30 min or briefly display temperature when I ask for weather.  Great deal at $39 with those optional add-ons.  I chose the free 6 months Amazon Unlimited Music.  Happy with Dot Clock and enjoying Unlimited Music deal.\n', ""\n  I have 2 echo dots 3rd generation without time display.. This 4th generation echo dot with time display is louder and so cute. The brightness is controlled through the Alexa app but is great. I do recommend the echo dot. The color is not a bright blue, i say it's more of a blue grey, it is not a bad blue shade at all. I really enjoy it. Great purchase and very well worth the wait.\n"", '\n  \xa0Sounds incredible coming from such a small device.  We have echos set up in every room.  Including the bathroom.  Have echo show in the den,  living room and Kirchen.  These Echo speakers in all three bedrooms,  and a dot in the bathroom which were about to upgrade to the all new 4th generation that will sound awesome in a tiled bathroom.\n', '\n  Don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs asking me to rate ‚Äúbrightness,‚Äù ‚Äúthickness,‚Äù and ‚Äú warmth.‚Äù It‚Äôs not really any of those things. The dot is great. I love having it by my bed, Alexa soothe me when I have a bad dream. The light bulb that came with it is garbage. I couldn‚Äôt get it to work, even right next to the dot. If it hadn‚Äôt been a free add on I would have returned it.\n', '\n  The volume will not stay above 2-3 when reminding you . Love the time dispaly and discovered it also displays the temp. if you ask it. All in all the last addition to my house as I have Not a single place for another maching . LOL Fact. My echo Dot is in the Bathroom. LOL\n', '\n  Bought this for hubs for Christmas for his garage man-cave and he loves it. The overall sound is better than expected, better than the 3rd generation we have in our master bathroom. (The 3-gen is great though for a smaller space.) The 4-gen is the perfect size/sound for the garage workshop and the clock is a cool addition. Even the blue colour works in our retro-design space. Also have it synced it to our overall system so that we can talk to each other between rooms - awesome feature!\n', '\n  Very nice product. Looks good in my living room. Clearly visible clock. I still havent learnt how to connect it with my echo dot. If it doest connect then it would be a bummer\n', '\n  I started to use yesterday. For now, I love it. Works perfect.\n', '\n  Great working device Greatly Priced!\n', '\n  Great\n']"

I use this dot as my alarm clock.  I like to set the alarm for a certain time and then snooze for a 1/2 hour and have the alarm go off again.  You can do this by setting two alarms.  I can decide what kind of music to wake to.  If I want Sirius, Pandora, Iheart radio, an alarm buzzer, etc. While lying in bed I can get my flash report to start the day.  The only problem is sometimes it doesn't respond.  I have to raise my voice to wake Alexa up.  I have a generation 1 dot in the next room over and it will answer instead this new  generation 4 dot, which is right next to me.  Also this Generation 4 Alexa will not hear me if I whisper first thing in the morning. (I think Alexa is sleeping too well)  The rest of the day she hears just fine.  I have reset voice recognition and she still acts up.  I really like the features with the clock and that it shows the temperature when you ask.  Since Alexa on this 4th generation dot doesn't hear as well as my 1st and 2nd generation dots it gets only 4 stars.\n"", '\n  Even though the specifications for the speakers are basically the same as the flat dots, these speakers are far superior. It\'s possible that a software upgrade has fixed an issue with the original dots, but these offer the option of 24-hour time on the clocks.These have joined a huge Alexa family in my house, so I can listen to music everywhere I choose.A tip: If you want to hear music without a ""random"" mix, you can go into the Amazon music app and create playlists that contain what you want--without having to listen to the stuff you *don\'t* want. You can put in a whole album and call it ""My Sgt. Pepper playlist"" and you\'ll get the entire album, with the songs in the order they were meant to be listened to.Creating that playlist thing is rather cumbersome if you are using Amazon. I don\'t know how hard it is in other music apps. But once you\'ve created it and learn how to use the commands, it\'s terrific.\n', '\n  It‚Äôs Not White!Its named Glacier White. that color is as ambiguous as it gets, original Glacier white has a brown tint. The Grey tint of the Amazon Glacier white is 20% Gray. Not white at all.The echo and the usb cable and power adapter...: gray!!I have original real white Echo ( 3rd gen ) its white I will post pictures latter.  Pros- clock is great, dimmable and self regulating brightness. However the Dimmed light color temperature remains the same bright daylight , not very pleasing or warm at all.Blue ring light at the bottom is major improvementSound  is far superior to the new little Apple Home Pod mini.other then misleading color description we love itJK\n', '\n  So, this is my first Alexa device, other than my phone of course, and she\'s awesome! I didn\'t know how badly I needed Alexa in my life. I got the echo dot with the clock and smart light bulb bundle. I\'m a single guy living in a little studio and it\'s still really useful. Adjust the lights, play music, set alarms & reminders. I\'ll even ask her questions if I\'m watching shows, like ""how many miles in _ kilometers"" or whatever. It\'s fun and useful and if you don\'t have an Alexa device yet, you\'re missing out. Trust me.\n', '\n  Echo is my newest best friend and smart bulb just frosting in the cake. Put this one in my bedroom Placed bulb in my bed stand lamp. Easy voice command to turn it in/off. Wake up to easy command for weather, Amazon notifications including deliveries, morning music and news updates, etc etc etc. soooo easy to set up. Plug in and Alexa steps you through the rest.\n', ""\n  We got this to replace the first gen echo dot and our alarm clock in our bedroom that sat where we both could see it at night. I wish the time displayed brighter, and possibly even a little larger, but it's not impossible for me to see from bed. I love the glacier color that we picked. The speaker on this is AMAZING! The sound quality is excellent and the voice recognition speed is very quick in comparison to our old echo dot. It's perfect for what we need it for but I'm excited for future generations possibly with a bigger/brighter clock!\n"", ""\n  Never thought I'd be talking to a speaker who has a name.  But that's what I'm doing and I love it.  This is by my bedside so it's my alarm clock, radio, etc.  I liked this one so much that I bought another one for downstairs and one for my friend who has MS and has a hard time getting around.\n"", ""\n  I traded in my old 2nd gen for a big$5.00 rebate. I should have given it away. Anyway the sphere is nice, I like the illuminated clock and temp when you ask the weather and it's not too bright, when I look at the time in the early hours of morning. I voice trained it so it gives my name when I say good morning and tells me my schedule and the days weather. I am happy that I updated to this one.\n"", '\n  Stopped working after two weeks.  Return process is a joke. It only redirects me to the product and does not allow me to contact support for a shipping label to return for a new one.  Returns only accepted until Jan 31, but will expire.  Don‚Äôt buy this product.  Waste of money.Update - customer service was supposed to send a label but it‚Äôs now february 11 and I haven‚Äôt received it.\n', '\n  Unit is fine addition to home. Clock hard to read at times on grey background. Perhaps darker colour would help.
