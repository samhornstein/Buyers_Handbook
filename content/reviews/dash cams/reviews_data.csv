A guy turned in front of me when I had the green light and I hit him. He told the officer that it was my fault little did he know I had it all on Rove Dash Cam. Showed it to the officer on scene and the officer was able to conduct the traffic investigation off my video right there on scene, and then he thanked me for the dash cam video and thought it was a great tool to have for this reason. Thank you Rove Dash Cam!!\n', ""\n  This is my 3rd camera from Amazon.  And the ONLY one that is great!  In my opinion and basing it on the ones I have.  My first one was good, but low quality video, 2nd was 1020P video but crud night vision.  While the night vision on this one is good, it is grainy but you can still see details, could tell if someone hit you, or you witness an accident.I put up a few photos showing the clarity of the pictures.  This are grabbed from moving pictures (screen shots) but still very clear.The things I love about it;1.  GPS tells how fast you're going, what direction and your coordinates at all times.  If a cop pulls you over and says you're doing 65 in a 55 zone, if you were, oops, if not, you have video proof of exactly how fast you were going.2.  You not only have video but you can take snapshots at any time, even use it as a camera to take pictures of places and things.  Might have to carry a battery pack for power but it's a great cam too.3.  I can connect to it with my Android phone (works with smart phones too) and see what it sees.  Of course the range isn't going to be super long but say it's on outside a restaurant and you're close enough, you can connect and watch what's going on.4.  The suction cup to mount to the windshield is the best I've seen.  It also has other mounting options but I chose this and it's great.5.  I can do 1, 3, 5 and 10 minute size video.  You can also do 4gb per video but at the highest setting, you're not going to get much, and that setting is the only setting that once the micro sd card is full, it will not overwrite old files.  The other settings will.6.  You can watch the video on the cam, your phone, your TV and the computer.7.  With the Rove APP you not only see your videos, but it will show you on the map where you are during the video.So... if you do have an accident, or witness one like I did a couple of months back with my old camera, quality is why I ordered this one.  But anyhow, you are covered.  Has 150 degree view angle (could be a bit more for my liking) but you can see for yourself in the pictures I posted.The ONLY thing I don't like is the size of the screen but I knew the size before I ordered it as it's posted in the description so I can't ding it for that.  A larger screen would be nice but the camera is still great.\n"", '\n  \xa0This camera is clear and it is easy to use once you get to know what each button does. I sat down and read the book that came with it way before using it so that I could get a good understanding of everything. The video provided is at default settings, so I haven\'t even set it to 4K yet and it is this clear. I do recommend the 128 Samsung 10 class u3 SD card for it as it records without freezing. I haven\'t had any problems, but if I do, I will post an update. So far so good though.I can\'t comment on the app yet because I haven\'t used it, but when I do I will update. Also, I haven\'t used the player yet either, but I did download it for Mac, so it is Mac and PC compatible. Once I use these features, I will update again.Update (2/15/2019): I finally used the app and it seemed to work well for me. It was very easy to connect to and I was able to see my videos. I can\'t figure out how to use the player though. I thought if I insert the sd card to my computer, it would read from the video player and show me the data, but that wasn\'t the case. If anyone figures out how to do this, please let me know. Also, I have integrated the camera into my video, meaning that I bought a kit so that I could plug it into the fuse box for a direct power source. I like the fact that it was easy to do and it now turns off the minute that the vehicle is turned off. The only time it will turn back on is if you have parking mode on, but it shuts off about 3 minutes after it has recorded an impact while parked ( i tested it by shaking my vehicle, I did not get hit). When I turned my vehicle back on, it spoke to me and said, ""parking mode was activated,"" so I knew right away that I needed to check what happened (of course, this was only a test though). Anyway, so far so good and the video is fantastic. When I learn to work with the player, I will update again. :)Update (12-18-2019) So I figured out everything and so far so good. I ended up buying another one because my son wanted one just like it. He loved how easy it was and the updates that Rove puts out for the cam. They also contacted us when we ordered it. They just said that if we needed anything they would be more than happy to speak to us over the phone with a live agent. What a live agent! They were very nice. I have not had a problem with this cam at all and I do recommend it to others. I just saw that they are having a sale on their website for it, so I might buy another one for my husband. Can you say Christmas gift :) They have a 25% off code on the website. I believe it is ROVEVIP25 to get 25% off. Anyway, this is a great dashcam and I couldn\'t have asked for more. I am a loyal customer!\n', '\n  \xa0Very good in night .. vote thí item\n', '\n  This is a great camera for your car. Small and easy to install and video quality is fantastic. The Car DV player is good but picture quality is better when played with the VLC player. I did have a codec issue with the VLC player and minor issue with sun glare (not the cameras Fault) and both issues were promptly responded to by the seller. Another nice feature with the VLC player is the ability to zoom in to read tags and things better.  I also use the motion detection feature to record when there is motion around the car when it is parked.  Have been using a Patriot 128 micro sd card and get about a months worth of video on it set at the HD mode. See attached photos. I would highly recommend car dash cam and the seller provides great support for any issues..\n', ""\n  So.... I bought two of these dash cams, one for myself and one for a buddy. We both drive transport trucks and in today's climate  it is imperative you have video footage to support any claims or actions for or against you in traffic court. The one I gave my buddy worked well and he's had no problem. I on the other had had freezing issues constantly. It was suggested that it was due to the SD Card I was using and Andy from customer service sent me a link to a preferred SD Card to purchase.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XWZWYVP/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_cpjABbH8CS1V6After installing it I was still having problem with the freezing issue. A few emails later Andy suggested it may be better if he just called me. I said sure and gave him my number. Ringing me up he asked what version of software my Rove came with. I told him and he said that I had the old software installed and that there was an updated version I should installed. He shot me off an other email with the new files to download along with installation instructions. The install is strait forward with no surprises. After powering on the unit the entire display had been changed upgraded and WOW he wasn't kidding when he said the worked along time on this update. Since the update I've had NO issues with freezing or anything. I can say I am impressed with the product. Although, what I'm more impressed with is the level of customer support I received from this company. Their customer service should be used as a template for other companies to follow. Andy told me that if this update did not work that he would replace or refund my purchase and that it would be MY CHOICE.  I have a few more cars of family members that will be receiving this product in the near future without hesitation.  PS. In no way have I been paid for my comments. This is truly how I feel and I don't say this lightly. It's hard to impress me. THEY DID JUST THAT  - Terry\n"", '\n  I was contemplating a different dash cam with WiFi (well known make 512gw) but saw this cam on the U.S site. It is hugely popular with the U.S truckers, and having read the reviews there and seen the silly negative ones here (about the plasticises used in production which a particular U.S state demands is on all plastic items) I decided to give it a try.Firstly I hooked it up to my computer and checked the firmware, it is bang up to date. Software for the camera was easily installed onto PC.Upon installation in my truck, I’ve had a lot of window suction pads over the years (sat navs, phones and previous cams) and this is by far and back, the best screen adhesion of them all. You can also use sticky pads (provided) and as it came with both a suction pad and a clip for using the sticky pads, I put them in my car windscreen. (I have since tested sliding it out of one T bar mount (suction pad) and transferring it into the one in the car and it was very simple to do. So effectively, whenever I drive, I have this cam in the vehicle. It is also supplied with short and long usb cables, which helped a lot as my truck has a usb connection within reach of the screen, my car doesn’t, so long one went in the car.This week I had a possible insurance scam incident on the M6 roadworks in Cheshire. Bloke pulled in front, brake hard, then pulled away onto the coned area of the hard shoulder. As I didn’t hit him, I carried on. Upon arrival at the customer, I fired up the app on my iPad (also have it on phone). WiFi connection to phone was simple. Press to stop filming first, then into menu, go right, first item in WiFi, turn it on. Next on tablet, with app running, goto WiFi settings and the rove is displayed, connect and then once connected, return to app. Files were very easy to find, and simple to download. Be prepared, a 5 minute clip in 4K is over 600mb !  Cam takes upto a 128gb micro sd card and I recommend buying a decent one (class 10 and make sure it is 4K compatible or card will soon be useless) of those so you can record near enough a whole day. The video quality was fantastic, and I could easily read his number plate on the iPad screen. Saved clip to phone. You can also use the iPad as a remote screen for the camera once connected, interesting as you can leave connected to WiFi, and use as security device. You can also change most settings probably more easily using the iPad than the small buttons these cams all haveOverall, I am delighted with this cam. I can see why the truckers over the pond love it and it gets a massive big thumbs up from meOnce again, regarding the SD card. Upto 128gb. You just get both class 10 and 4K compatible. Due to the complexities I don’t understand of recording and re-recording 4K on sd cards, they will fail if they don’t meet that standard\n', ""\n  I bought one of theses to replace an Apeman Dash Cam which had failed.I must say I am very impressed with it, it is great quality and good value for money. I had been contemplating a Nextbase Dash Cam, but this one popped up on Amazon. Whilst there were only 3 reviews for this in the UK, I somehow managed to get to Amazon USA, where there was 100 + reviews all saying how good it was, so I bit the bullet.The item arrived the following day, the packaging & presentation were very impressive, the instructions printed on good quality paper AND all in English!The instructions were easy to read ( unlike many Chinese electronics) also the controls on the camera were easy to use and understand. I downloaded the Rove app to my phone & I can now watch live video or download recorded files on my phone, I have got to say I'm very impressed with it. Night shots are nice & bright and easily viewed ( unlike a friends Nextbase, which just shows a dark screen at night). The picture quality is very good due to the high resolution.I did have a problem downloading the software to my iPad and also an Android tablet, but after contacting Customer services, it appears my iPad is an old version which will not support the app. Another issue I had was the micro SD card was not overwriting the old files and I got a message saying the card was full. Again I contacted Andy in Customer services to be asked if I was using a good quality SD card.  I have since fitted a SanDisk 32gb microSD card and the problem is resolved.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase, the item is of good quality and there is also very good prompt customer service. I would recommend this Dash Cam. As stated earlier there are only a few reviews on Amazon UK as Rove have just started selling this Dash Cam in the UK. If you are looking for a good quality Dash Cam with WiFi & GPS look no further, this is the one to buy!\n"", '\n  I have just viewed the first video files from my new Rove R2-4K and I am quite satisfied with the video quality.  Here’s my experience so far. Unpacking the dashcam, I was impressed with the detailed user manual, information regarding what micro-SD card to purchase, and Rove’s emphasis on customer satisfaction. The provided Amazon link for the recommended micro-SD card was for the US only and including a Canadian link would have been helpful. After some research and reading numerous reviews, I followed Rove’s recommendation of ordering a micro-SD card directly from Amazon. Since Rove provides excellent and detailed how to videos for setting up the dashcam, I barely had to look at the printed manual. These videos are a real bonus, are extremely helpful, and once again reinforce the company’s focus on customer care. Bravo! One thing that did not work was the Car DV Player for PC which I downloaded from the Rove site. Once installed, it showed my progress on a map, but the window where the video should have played remained empty. I was able to play the dashcam video on several media players including VLC. The video was of good quality and very sharp with the sun behind my vehicle. Driving into the sun, the quality deteriorated a bit so that license plates were no longer easily readable (see attached screenshot). I am running the dashcam on the highest available video quality setting. The wifi connection works well and is an easy way to change settings on the dashcam, but downloading video is slow and I opted to transfer video to my computer using the micro-SD card instead. The camera itself seems solid and well-built and the built-in view screen is more than adequate. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.\n', '\n  \xa0The Rove R2-4K Dash Cam is without a doubt the best DC I have ever owned.Compact and ease of use are paramount to my needs for business, scenic holidays and piece of mind should an accident take place. This DC has it all.Quality of any product is important but of equal importance is the support and service after the fact. The team at Rovehave stepped up to the plate nicely, thank you.Stephen Price\n']"

I've been using it daily for over 8 months and it's been perfect. The clarity and data storage is amazing. Caught a vehicle crash in front of me and was able to turn it over to the driver not at fault. Last week, it began to give me problems with turning on and off intermittently during my drive, as if the device wouldn't hold a charge. I contacted Apeman Customer Support and had the privilege of speaking with Katherine. After a few emails of troubleshooting with no success, she agreed to send me a replacement. Things break sometimes and most people get that. However, the high-level of customer service provided to me by Katherine was exceptional. Thank you Apeman team.\n"", ""\n  \xa0The image quality is pretty good at night. The camera does not have night vision, but make up with the WDR, HDR features. (Note: make sure the inside of your windshield is clean, unlike mine.)The dash camera was very neatly packaged. Very slink design with the black matte finish. No over-complicated glossy design, this is what a dash camera should look like. It has a nice 3' in display screen, it's not a touch screen but it's nice to have a big screen to navigate the menus.The instructions are pretty simple, also in multiple languages. The cables included are long enough to run around the car neatly. The included charging cable has a built-in USB charging port, which great if you only have one cigarette lighter receptacle.There are two different types of mounts included (1) is a suction cup the other is a sticky pad. Suction cup mount has two adjustments nobs which are very easy to use to get the correct angle. The suction mount has a twist to secure feature I like when locking the suction cup in place.The menu is easy to navigate, tons of great features built-into this camera like motion detection, seamless loop recording and parking monitor.It took me about 15 minutes to install and run the cabling through the car.Great little dash camera!!Note: Amazon's video upload quality is terrible. Video samples can be on found YT.The video does not reflect the quality that the dash camera records, its very high res and smooth.\n"", '\n  I have had this camera for over 3 weeks now. I was hesitant to purchase it thinking the good old ""you get what you pay for"". Turned out, I was wrong. I read the reviews, albeit few, compared to my previous Rexing V1 dash cam. I decided to give it a try. Well, I love it. I love the clarity of the video, the design, the ease of setting it up, the overall quality for the price I paid. The only con was the fact that the camera arrives on default screensaver ON when you connect it; meaning, it\'s still recording but the screen is blank to avoid distraction while driving. I was unable to find the screensaver turn OFF feature in the settings. I contacted the seller and they told me that the screensaver turn off feature was under LCD Brightness, which was odd. But I found it and turned it on. So far, I love it, works perfectly fine. Very responsive and fast customer service; open communication, help available when needed. Will update my review if any changes down the road.\n', ""\n  \xa0well, first, this price is affordable and cheap for a dash cam, so you can't simply compare this product with other super expensive one. second, i'm not using this to record any v-blog or as a go pro. it is what it is, a dash cam, to record the driving record in case there's something happened in the terrible traffic condition in the bay area. last, it works. it does it job well. sound is clear, the wide angle pretty much catches everything ahead of my car. one thing need to mention is you may need to buy a good sd card for better storage. one drawback i can think of right now is during the nighttime, even though it still works, but day time is better and clearer overall.\n"", '\n  I was hesitant to buy a ""lower quality"" dash cam. My friend, who seems to know everything about cameras, told me if I\'m not spending at least $250 on a dash cam, I\'m not getting something good. I was like...whatever I can\'t afford that. I have to say I\'m really glad I went with this one. The picture is good, it was easy to install, and it records when the car is parked so I know what\'s going on. I\'m taking a star off because the buttons/menu are kind of complicated. It\'s not totally intuitive which button you\'re supposed to push to select and stuff, so you end up back at the home screen a lot while you\'re trying to figure it out. But...not that big of a deal, really. I\'m happy with this purchaseEdit: 6 months later and I\'m still very happy with this camera!\n', ""\n  It's a good quality cam with great video quality. It was easy to install with simple instructions. It’s a great quality cam, the manual made it clear how to operate it, great video quality, the camera turns automatically when the car starts, the screen is clear and the recording clarity is amazing. Highly recommend!\n"", ""\n  Way, way better than the first dash camera I bought years ago (NOT from Apeman).I set up and used this dashcam for over a week, both in day and night, and reviewed the footage before writing this review.Short review: Works great, visibility is good. Everything is as I would hope, I would recommend this dashcam.  Read on for more detail.This camera has all the specs it claimed. I measured. The lens is 170 degrees corner to corner.The 1080p video is good quality. The 30 fps is nice and smooth.The video at night isn't too noisy or grainy. Also the highlights are not too blown out when it is dark out.My expectations were high. I had previously purchased the Apeman 4k action camera, and was very impressed with the video and stills I was able to get with that camera. So I was hopeful this camera could live up to the action camera's quality. The lens is actually much better in this dash camera than the action camera!Pros: - It was super easy to set up. - Cord was long enough to wrap around the windshield of my mini-van. - I can actually read licence plates.  I could not at all with my previous dash camera.  At night it is harder to read licence plates, they are too reflective but that isn't unexpected.  Licence plates are covered with a reflective material so if it is in the middle of your headlights it will over  expose, but if the plates are just off to the side of the headlights you can still make out the plate number. - You can do time lapses with it.  You can set it for 1 seconds, 5 seconds, and 10 seconds between photos.  Not with video at the same time, but I like having the option to take larger photos instead.  It doesn't compile the photos into another video, but you can easily do that on a computer.Cons: - I wish the manual was a little more verbose.  I felt I had to explore menus and guess at which button did what.  I also would like to know more about the other modes, like 'continuous picture mode'.  It says 10 mega pixels, but I am unsure how many frames per second it would be.  I imagine it would depend on memory card speed.Tips: - Put the Camera where your wipers can reach.  At first I placed the camera directly behind my mirror; when I cleaned my windows the camera got  obscured because the wipers didn't reach in front of the camera. - Make sure the window is very clean when driving at night.  All the spots and streaks really show up with oncoming headlights.- Only remove the memory card when the driver's door and window are closed.  The memory card slot is spring loaded to help remove it.  I used my fingernail to press on my memory card, and it shot out of the camera, out my drivers side  window, and under my neighbor's car parked next to me!\n"", '\n  \xa0Very satisfied with the product. I was almost buying a cam over 100 dollar price then came across this product. I took the chance and now so happy with my decision. This small and compact dashcam does the job. I was almost having an accident other and when later I watched the recording it was very clear to see who is a fault.  The picture quality and motion detection are more than enough for a dashcam. The suction power good enough and had no issues in the last 1 month of use.  The only this you have to buy is an SD card for storage. That was the only thing that annoyed me. Why not include the SD card with added value. Overall, this das cam is the best bang for the bucks.\n', '\n  \xa0This dash cam is small and compact but captures a wide angle. It is easy to set up thanks to the detailed manual and comes with everything needed except the SD card. The picture and video quality are good and depending on which lane you’re driving in you can even see the street name signs. I really like having the other features as well. It’s affordable and for the quality and features, it’s a great value buy.\n', '\n  Great value for this Dash camera.Pros:- Good videos with ""G detection""- No frills simple functionality for a good price- Solid build, compact package that doesn\'t obstruct your vision- Easy to setup with nice long USB cable- The image quality is pretty good at night.Room for improvement: - The camera does not have night vision, but make up with the WDR, HDR features.- The suction mount pivot doesn\'t lock, so it\'s possible for the camera to ""yaw"" out of position if the cord is yanked. Consider making this lockable.OverallIt\'s a good quality cam with great video quality. It’s a great quality cam. It was easy to install with simple instructions.  the camera turns automatically when the car starts, the screen is clear and the recording clarity is amazing. Highly recommend!\n', ""\n  \xa0This is my third dash cam from Apeman. I bought one in 2018 and damaged power supply port after using it for more than a year because I was using a broken charging cable and not the one came with the dash-cam. I reached out to their support staff for a discount if I buy a new one as I was out of warranty. They sent me a new one at 50% discount.This year my car got broken into and they took my dash-cam among couple of quarters of spare change. I didn't hesitate and bought this latest model from Apeman right away. The picture quality is great at 1080p and clear audio recording.

I've been using it daily for over 8 months and it's been perfect. The clarity and data storage is amazing. Caught a vehicle crash in front of me and was able to turn it over to the driver not at fault. Last week, it began to give me problems with turning on and off intermittently during my drive, as if the device wouldn't hold a charge. I contacted Apeman Customer Support and had the privilege of speaking with Katherine. After a few emails of troubleshooting with no success, she agreed to send me a replacement. Things break sometimes and most people get that. However, the high-level of customer service provided to me by Katherine was exceptional. Thank you Apeman team.\n"", ""\n  \xa0The image quality is pretty good at night. The camera does not have night vision, but make up with the WDR, HDR features. (Note: make sure the inside of your windshield is clean, unlike mine.)The dash camera was very neatly packaged. Very slink design with the black matte finish. No over-complicated glossy design, this is what a dash camera should look like. It has a nice 3' in display screen, it's not a touch screen but it's nice to have a big screen to navigate the menus.The instructions are pretty simple, also in multiple languages. The cables included are long enough to run around the car neatly. The included charging cable has a built-in USB charging port, which great if you only have one cigarette lighter receptacle.There are two different types of mounts included (1) is a suction cup the other is a sticky pad. Suction cup mount has two adjustments nobs which are very easy to use to get the correct angle. The suction mount has a twist to secure feature I like when locking the suction cup in place.The menu is easy to navigate, tons of great features built-into this camera like motion detection, seamless loop recording and parking monitor.It took me about 15 minutes to install and run the cabling through the car.Great little dash camera!!Note: Amazon's video upload quality is terrible. Video samples can be on found YT.The video does not reflect the quality that the dash camera records, its very high res and smooth.\n"", '\n  I have had this camera for over 3 weeks now. I was hesitant to purchase it thinking the good old ""you get what you pay for"". Turned out, I was wrong. I read the reviews, albeit few, compared to my previous Rexing V1 dash cam. I decided to give it a try. Well, I love it. I love the clarity of the video, the design, the ease of setting it up, the overall quality for the price I paid. The only con was the fact that the camera arrives on default screensaver ON when you connect it; meaning, it\'s still recording but the screen is blank to avoid distraction while driving. I was unable to find the screensaver turn OFF feature in the settings. I contacted the seller and they told me that the screensaver turn off feature was under LCD Brightness, which was odd. But I found it and turned it on. So far, I love it, works perfectly fine. Very responsive and fast customer service; open communication, help available when needed. Will update my review if any changes down the road.\n', ""\n  \xa0well, first, this price is affordable and cheap for a dash cam, so you can't simply compare this product with other super expensive one. second, i'm not using this to record any v-blog or as a go pro. it is what it is, a dash cam, to record the driving record in case there's something happened in the terrible traffic condition in the bay area. last, it works. it does it job well. sound is clear, the wide angle pretty much catches everything ahead of my car. one thing need to mention is you may need to buy a good sd card for better storage. one drawback i can think of right now is during the nighttime, even though it still works, but day time is better and clearer overall.\n"", '\n  I was hesitant to buy a ""lower quality"" dash cam. My friend, who seems to know everything about cameras, told me if I\'m not spending at least $250 on a dash cam, I\'m not getting something good. I was like...whatever I can\'t afford that. I have to say I\'m really glad I went with this one. The picture is good, it was easy to install, and it records when the car is parked so I know what\'s going on. I\'m taking a star off because the buttons/menu are kind of complicated. It\'s not totally intuitive which button you\'re supposed to push to select and stuff, so you end up back at the home screen a lot while you\'re trying to figure it out. But...not that big of a deal, really. I\'m happy with this purchaseEdit: 6 months later and I\'m still very happy with this camera!\n', ""\n  It's a good quality cam with great video quality. It was easy to install with simple instructions.

Highly recommend!\n"", ""\n  Way, way better than the first dash camera I bought years ago (NOT from Apeman).I set up and used this dashcam for over a week, both in day and night, and reviewed the footage before writing this review.Short review: Works great, visibility is good. Everything is as I would hope, I would recommend this dashcam.  Read on for more detail.This camera has all the specs it claimed. I measured. The lens is 170 degrees corner to corner.The 1080p video is good quality. The 30 fps is nice and smooth.The video at night isn't too noisy or grainy. Also the highlights are not too blown out when it is dark out.My expectations were high. I had previously purchased the Apeman 4k action camera, and was very impressed with the video and stills I was able to get with that camera. So I was hopeful this camera could live up to the action camera's quality. The lens is actually much better in this dash camera than the action camera!Pros: - It was super easy to set up. - Cord was long enough to wrap around the windshield of my mini-van. - I can actually read licence plates.  I could not at all with my previous dash camera.  At night it is harder to read licence plates, they are too reflective but that isn't unexpected.  Licence plates are covered with a reflective material so if it is in the middle of your headlights it will over  expose, but if the plates are just off to the side of the headlights you can still make out the plate number. - You can do time lapses with it.  You can set it for 1 seconds, 5 seconds, and 10 seconds between photos.  Not with video at the same time, but I like having the option to take larger photos instead.  It doesn't compile the photos into another video, but you can easily do that on a computer.Cons: - I wish the manual was a little more verbose.  I felt I had to explore menus and guess at which button did what.  I also would like to know more about the other modes, like 'continuous picture mode'.  It says 10 mega pixels, but I am unsure how many frames per second it would be.  I imagine it would depend on memory card speed.Tips: - Put the Camera where your wipers can reach.  At first I placed the camera directly behind my mirror; when I cleaned my windows the camera got  obscured because the wipers didn't reach in front of the camera. - Make sure the window is very clean when driving at night.  All the spots and streaks really show up with oncoming headlights.- Only remove the memory card when the driver's door and window are closed.  The memory card slot is spring loaded to help remove it.  I used my fingernail to press on my memory card, and it shot out of the camera, out my drivers side  window, and under my neighbor's car parked next to me!\n"", '\n  \xa0Very satisfied with the product. I was almost buying a cam over 100 dollar price then came across this product. I took the chance and now so happy with my decision. This small and compact dashcam does the job. I was almost having an accident other and when later I watched the recording it was very clear to see who is a fault.  The picture quality and motion detection are more than enough for a dashcam. The suction power good enough and had no issues in the last 1 month of use.  The only this you have to buy is an SD card for storage. That was the only thing that annoyed me. Why not include the SD card with added value. Overall, this das cam is the best bang for the bucks.\n', '\n  \xa0This dash cam is small and compact but captures a wide angle. It is easy to set up thanks to the detailed manual and comes with everything needed except the SD card. The picture and video quality are good and depending on which lane you’re driving in you can even see the street name signs. I really like having the other features as well. It’s affordable and for the quality and features, it’s a great value buy.\n', '\n  Great value for this Dash camera.Pros:- Good videos with ""G detection""- No frills simple functionality for a good price- Solid build, compact package that doesn\'t obstruct your vision- Easy to setup with nice long USB cable- The image quality is pretty good at night.Room for improvement: - The camera does not have night vision, but make up with the WDR, HDR features.- The suction mount pivot doesn\'t lock, so it\'s possible for the camera to ""yaw"" out of position if the cord is yanked. Consider making this lockable.OverallIt\'s a good quality cam with great video quality. It’s a great quality cam. It was easy to install with simple instructions.  the camera turns automatically when the car starts, the screen is clear and the recording clarity is amazing. Highly recommend!\n', ""\n  \xa0This is my third dash cam from Apeman. I bought one in 2018 and damaged power supply port after using it for more than a year because I was using a broken charging cable and not the one came with the dash-cam. I reached out to their support staff for a discount if I buy a new one as I was out of warranty. They sent me a new one at 50% discount.This year my car got broken into and they took my dash-cam among couple of quarters of spare change. I didn't hesitate and bought this latest model from Apeman right away. The picture quality is great at 1080p and clear audio recording. The camera G-sensor is better than ever and I always keep it on parking mode, which is a great feature to have at this price.I would highly recommend this product and if any issues you'll be provided with great customer service.\n""]"

After several emails back and forth, they notified me that my replacement camera was on the way. It arrived in 5-days and I love this camera and now I love Chortau's customer service. I would definitely buy this product again.\n"", '\n  I am blown away at the quality of this camera. If your looking for a camera for your truck, car or SUV this is great.The camera did have a issue when I first put in the Scandisk class 10 micro card. All I did was unplug it from power and plugged it back in and it instantly started to record.Yes I know, you have to buy a card, but they are really cheap now. I paid $10 for a 64 gig and it lasts almost a week and a half before it starts deleting older videos.The only issue was with the rear camera. My back window on my truck is flat and the mount that came with it didn\'t work. So I went to home Depot and paid $3 for a ""L"" shaped bracket and got some 3M automotive tape and made one.I have had the unit for two weeks now and glad I purchased it. For around $40 it\'s great. I highly recommend and we are going to buy another one for my SUV next\n', ""\n  \xa0this is my second car cam, so far so good.  it's not melt in hot weather like my first cam. high quality\n"", '\n  I am a little to say that I am a “road killer”. I’ve had three car crashes in the past year. However, those accidents were all about my car being hit by others. I bought this dash cam just like bought good insurance when I was ever in an accident to prove I am not at fault. When the first day I installed this gadget on my car, I thought, “wow, wow.“ there is no doubt five stars. I took it out of the car to write this comment. Sadly, I only took one pictures and it was taken when I was shaking because it did not have much power. In spite of this, hopefully you can see how clear and detailed it is. the night vision is also clear. The camera is super easy to install. It is small and exquisite. I hardly felt it when I was driving. It’s loop recording so I do not have to worry about memory space. I’m very happy with it so far. It is a great shopping experience!!!\n', '\n  Camera image is very good, have not got the back camera working yet as cable was too short for my truck. Hoping to get cable soon that customer service was happy to work with me on. Hopefully it works as I need the backup function. Screen was smaller than last camera as I did not expect 1/2"" to make such a ""large"" difference, but still clear image. Only complaint so far would be the camera does not start recording when it receives power but need to be turned on each time, which I do not always remember. Also, when the ""motion"" cam is activated it takes several seconds before it turns on. The slow activation could miss what hit the vehicle to activate the camera.\n', '\n  \xa0(So regarding the video i said i got it on dash cam like i did in the video to mock some people who over-react when they catch something on dash cam. also camera quality is alot better than this but due to the file size the quality went down.) Okay to be honest I never rate products unless they are absolute crap and i feel i need to warn others. But that changed today with this little camera. for the price it is you cannot beat it. i have loved it so far. i live in Utah and the drivers here are terrible and as the weather gets worse the crazies come out onto the road. and i have already almost been hit from people not looking 3 times this week so i decided it was time to get a camera. this camera installed so nicely the wires were easy to hide under the trim.\n', ""\n  \xa0I bought it to provide evidence and an extra security in a foreign country.  I received the item quickly.  I like it for its clear and excellent video quality.  It was also easy to mount.  Just wish a larger size micro SD card would work.  32G was the max it took.  For a long drive, I would prefer a larger size SD card.  I had it in a foreign country, because the country's car insurance law were slightly different from USA.  Therefore, it provided a sense of security of evidence if it was needed.\n"", '\n  Very prompt delivery. Excellent value for money. The dash cam was very easy to install and use, it took twenty minutes to install. The picture quality is fantastic even when using the split screen mode. I bought two dash cams,one for my son and one for one of my work colleagues both of them are over the moon with the dash cams. The dash cam itself is quite small and does not cause a distraction when driving , as some cameras do due their size. I would definitely recommend this product. Especially if you want peace of mind when driving as you often hear of crash for cash scams  which are very common place. Definitely five star service. I would definitely use this company again. Keep up the good work 😁\n', ""\n  This dashcam is a lot more compact compared to the one that I had previous. The reason why I swapped was because my old one was rubbish in the twilight hours and at night. I haven't had this one that long, but the motion detection is handy for any little bumps that may occur. And need to replay some of the night time recordings to check the quality.One thing that I will say is that I thought this dashcam was meant to have night vision, but can't honestly say that I have found that setting yet to turn on....Although I have been able to install it myself, I'll still need to get someone who can wire it properly to do it for me.\n"", ""\n  As a driving instructor I needed a dash cam with a separate rear camera. It was easy to install and cable through to position on rear window. Video is good, stores each camera on different files to watch independently. The camera is well made, metal casing, feeling sturdy. The windscreen mount is good with screw in to the camera. All in all, well packaged and of good quality considering its low price. On the downside, video rear camera seemed to show as if I was on other side of road and although manual is good could better explained. Overall, if I compare it wish Aukey which I put in my daughter's car, Chortau is much better finish/quality. I plan to put a Chortau in my wife's car next.\n"", '\n  Only installed today but working well so far. More than enough cable for a Nissan Pulsar.

They work, they’ve captured some interesting incidents, and our family feels much better having them in place for daily commutes.We needed another camera for an additional vehicle, recently, so I decided to try this 4K version. The extra resolution seemed like it would be very helpful, as I had tried to see license plate numbers in videos from our HD cameras, and found them somewhat difficult to read.As soon as the 4K version arrived, I mounted it on my windshield next to the HD version for some direct side-by-side comparisons. The difference was incredible.This is one of those situations where you think you have decent picture quality, already, but the improved version just blows it away. See the attached frame captures and you’ll see what I mean.License plates that were fuzzy in HD are very crisp in 4K.License plates in the distance, that are unreadable in HD (can’t even count the number of digits!), are fuzzy in 4K - but READABLE. Check out the photo with the side-by-side comparison of the red truck. This is the key. It’s the difference between readable vs. non-readable.This is all subject to your personal preference, and your budget, but for me, 4K is well worth the difference in price.

I bought A129 Pro Duo to replace my almost brand new A129 Duo IR, which power cord got tiny damaged during last accident. (The other insurance company AAA decided to reimburse whole dash camera price plus installation fee, even though I did it by myself)For installation and user interface setup, both A129 Pro Duo and A129 Duo IR are very similar. I still feel the rear-to-front camera cable is a little stiff, but I had no problem with installation. Camera setup is easy, I keep default setup, just turn off G-Sensor.Here is what I like about A129 Pro Duo:Discreet design- After installation, the camera itself is hiding behind rear view mirror. It is pretty hard to see the dash camera if you don’t pay attention to the car. This is very important to me, because I have to park my car on street overnight.Stunning video quality- A129 Pro Duo front camera deliveries very sharp and clear 4K pictures with a lot of detail, at daytime. For a 4K camera, you defiantly could read a license plate further away than 1080P (will update how better it is than regular 1080P dash cam). The rear-view camera has decent 1080p video quality, and the night vision is a little better than front 4K camera, even at absolute dark parking garage, I still see everything in front of it.GPS Module- If order dash camera, I highly recommend it. I used to believe GPS module is used less. Until recently, I had accidents twice. Both time insurance company asked me: where did accident happen? And it took me sometime to figure it out. With a GPS module, right now I could easily locate where I was.BE AWARE:A129 Duo Pro 4K camera NEEDS U3 micro SD card. Currently, I am testing the dash cam with U1-32GB card, and temporary the camera is working fine, without any issue. As a new U3-128gb card is coming, I will continually use U1 card.You have to get a big or bigger SD card, either 128GB or 256GB. The A129 Pro Duo deliveries very clear picture, and it also generates very big file (about 300MB/Min). That means for a 32GB SD card, it barely holds a little more than 1 hour footage.\n', '\n  So when I first got this camera I was really upset.  I have a Pixel 4 XL and when I tried to connect to WiFi and change settings the camera would freeze (for that matter sometimes just turning on WiFi would freeze it).  Knowing that this camer had not been out long I wanted to troubleshoot it before deciding to send it back.  First thing I did was went to the website to see if there was a firmware update and only V1.0 was there.  I then decided to give there support an opporitunity to resolve the issues so I opened a ticket to see if someone had a suggestions on what to do to fix it (this was about 7pm CST on a Tuesday).  The next morning I had an email with a link to a new firmware that fixed the issue.  While the main issue was fixed I noticed some little quirks when saving settings that did not hinder me using the camera, but I figured I would let the company know what I found.  I was happy using it in its current state.  To my surprise the next morning I had another email with yet another firmware.  This time all issues were resolved.  The camera and the app are working great.  I am really impressed with the quality of this little thing.  I am most impressed with the quick and friendly customer support.  I am really glad I did not send this back.  I like supporting companies that have good customer service.  If anything changes I will update this review.\n', '\n  Bought this with the hardwire kit, polarising lens and 256GB Samsung SD card. Works like a charm. Parking mode is what I needed this for. After lots of research, this is definitely the best high end dashcam at affordable price range. Worth every dollar\n']"
