(I do own more expensive headphones and earbuds but sometimes it's good to have a few cheap options available in case something gets damaged or lost etc.) For the price, these are a good choice. Are there better sounding more durable earbuds out there? Yes, of course there are! That being said, you can have three or four sets of these, or, one pair that are more expensive... They paired with my iPhone XR without a problem. The charging case works fine, they sound fine for music and Netflix so far, and the fit is acceptable. Again, please remember the pricepoint here... I am not a fan of making/recieving phone calls using earbuds because it seems like the other person has trouble hearing me a lot of the time. So as far as that feature is concerned, I can't comment on it yet as I just don't use it. How long will they last? I have no idea. If things go downhill, I'll update my review.\n"", '\n  \xa0Great product, came quickly sounds is definitely loud enough for me! earbuds no buttons touch sensitive cool charging case.\n', '\n  So my wife took her headphones for a walk and got stuck in the pouring rain! Low and behold, she gets back from the walk and they are completely dead. I went on Amazon and found these earbuds that have the look of the Apple AirPod pros, and thought I’d give it a shot.Product arrived today and played around with it.In the box came the charging case (with earbuds inside), charging cable, other earbud sizes, quick start instructions, full manual, and 24 month warranty card (which was longer than I thought it was).The charging case has a magnetic top, so it doesn’t open up by accident. The two earbuds are also magnetically held in the case, which is great. Just get close to putting it in the case, and the magnets pull it right in.They easily connected to the iPhone and sounds great. The battery seems to last a long time, and the case will charge the earbuds 7 times before having to charge the case, which is phenomenal.Easy controls on them.. just tap on it and pause the music. A call comes in, tap on either earbud and answer the call. Tap again and hang up. Sound on the phone is great, as if you’re talking on the actual phone.I would recommend these headphone for anyone that’s looking for a less expensive alternative than Apple, and/or want a long warranty period.\n', ""\n  This is a Great wireless headset for the price! What I like about this product is that it comes in a cute small black charging case. Just plug it in and it charges the headset. The rubberized earbuds make it comfortable and easy to put in your ears and feel secure that they won't fall out. I love that the product comes with an additional pair of rubberized earbuds in case you lose one or need a different size. The sound quality is wonderful and it synchronizes with your phone within seconds. I purchased this for my son for Christmas and now my daughter wants one after trying it out! This is a great buy!!!!!\n"", ""\n  I have been in need of a new pair of bluetooth earbuds for a while. I was pleasantly surprised to find this affordable pair by Aukey.I also have Aukey charging cables and Aukey bluetooth transmitter for my car that I bought months ago. I find their products to be extremely high quality for such an affordable price. I've become a fan of this brand over the last few months!I had a feeling these bluetooth earbuds would be excellent for my needs, but I'm really impressed by the quality. They fit very well, sound is excellent, charging/carrying case is perfectly compact, and battery life is better than expected.I was able to use the bathroom at work today and I didn't have to pause my podcast... I was able to keep listening with these earbuds about 20 feet away from my device. Silly, but pretty cool.I HIGHLY recommend these earbuds! I like them so much thinking about getting a 2nd pair. One for home & one to keep at work.\n"", ""\n  I was not expecting much from these little guys. First off they came in a plain cardboard and felt way too light. Packaging was tight. But good. The case came out easy. Instructions at the bottom. Ear tips and USB cable.The case is small, thin, and extremely light. The case feels flimsy but not too bad. Case latches nicely and doesn't fly open easily.  Wish it was USB C but can't complain for the price.The buds are super light. Has indicator lights for syncing, when connected and when low power. The tips fit nicely. I was lucky to get a good seal with the stock pair of tips. The buds are light so it doesn't drag on your ears. They're a bit thicker than airpods but lighter. The fit is better with the orientation a bit more forward than hanging straight down like airpods. They are comfortable and don't hurt my ears after a couple hours. They work independently of each other. It does make a weird pause and beep when connecting separately though.This is where I was floored. The sound is really big for the price. These sound really good. The volume is great  not the loudest but good volume. The only thing they lack is clarity in the mids. It's not muddy but just not all there. The bass is sufficient, pretty much airpods level. The highs are very crisp. These may be a tad high heavy but everything sounds amazing for this price. Amazing!Because these are airpods style with the mic hanging down call quality is pretty decent. Not airpods good but decent.The touchpads work great! And battery life is decent. Lasted me about 3 hours on a charge.For the price, these are great. No brainier if you don't mind the airpods style. The toothbrush hanging from your ears. I don't mind and will be using these often.\n"", ""\n  I've bought a lot of wireless earbuds trying to find the ones that are right for me and these are easily in the top 10% in terms of audio quality and fidelity. There's a ok amount of bass but mids and highs are perfect. The fact that these use the APT-X codec is probably a factor in why these sound so good.these are using a Qualcomm technology called TWS Plus as opposed to the standard TWS. The previous generation of ear buds I bought relied on one bud to act as master and the 2nd bud to be slave. This TWS Plus generation equally distributes the processing to both buds and greatly increases battery life and signal strength. I have had no cut outs or signal issues with these buds.As is pretty standard, they came with several sets of the ear pieces, and I was able to easily find one that fit my ears. They are comfortable, and work great for music, videos and calls.\n"", ""\n  I'm really impressed with the sound quality of these buds. The bass is amazing without being too invasive and blurring the audio in your ear so that's a huge plus for me. These are super comfortable in the ear, they feel light and smooth and it even comes with the various ear-tips so you change sizes if needed. They have touch controls i.e. double tap to play/pause (this is perfect because my previous  pair would play/pause or hang up calls when all I wanted to do was adjust them in my ear - I couldn't do that without turning off my song or hanging up calls by mistake which was annoying - I won;t have that problem now!). The instructions are very clear so there shouldn't be any problem figuring out the touch controls in case you're worried about it! These can also be paired individually so you're not forced to have both on at the same time (I like to alternate sometimes so I can hear what's going on around me). Even with one in the sound isn't unbalanced so another positive. Would 100% recommend buying these.\n"", ""\n  1. Excellent fit - lightweight and comfortable, sturdy and remains solidly in the ear even when you're moving around.2. Big range of earbud adaptors provided with the headphones.3. Sound quality is amazing for such a small device - great all round sound, excellent for both watching films and listening to music. Volume is good enough to cover background noise such as public transport. Bass is very impressive in such a small unit!4. Ability to control by tap touch means you don't have to get your phone out of your pocket and have a wide range of control options.5. Simple, easy to follow quick start instructions and a good user manual detailing the various touch options.6. Incredibly quick and reliable Bluetooth pairing - fastest I've seen.I honestly can't really fault the product, it's a massive upgrade to the bluetooth headphones I had previously.Very impressed with these, I did not expect them to be such good value for the price.\n"", '\n  These Aukey wireless earphones are perfect. I have been working from home for some time and fed up with wearing a headset. I was unable to pair my well-known headphones to my work laptop and getting frustrated. I found these and very glad I did.They arrived next day in a very compact recyclable package. Unpacked, charged and paired to my laptop in no time. Really simple process. Did the same with my phone and tablet and just as simple and successful each time.The headphones have all the features you would like in a headset, and once I had selected the correct fittings for my ears they fitted perfectly and do not fall out. I have tried eating with them in, running and wrestling with my little boy and they still have not fallen out.Having them work with my business laptop helps enormously, as I am now able to wear them for conference calls and the feedback from meeting attendees is that they can hear me perfectly and I can hear them clearly too ..... and when not in meetings can listen to music from my iPhone too, with the added benefit of being able to answer the phone with them also..... and they work with Siri ......Perfect.If you are looking for quality in-ear headphones, with the features you would expect and at a great price, I would highly recommend these. I am really pleased I bought them. 5 stars from me.\n', '\n  PROS:- Neat sturdy little box which looks nice and is a good size to carry around.- Headphones connect immediately and there\'s no delay.- Sound quality is pretty good for the price, an everyday listener won\'t have any issues with the sound.- Pretty comfortable to wear and don\'t fall out of the ear easily.- Charge stays for a good amount of time and the charging case is really useful.CONS:- Touch is very inconsistent. It\'s may or may not work. Even after finding the right ""spot"", it\'s not reliable. So, if you need your touch to work really well, don\'t have an expectations.- While the earphones don\'t necessarily fall out they can get a bit loose if you\'re yawning/chewing. Maybe it\'s because the earbud isn\'t perfect for my ear but just thought I\'d mention it.- It sometimes has connectivity issues with my MacBook (a slight delay) but connects immediately with an Android.Overall for the price it\'s a good buy and would recommend if you don\'t have high expectations :)\n']"

I like the design and appearance. The sound quality is equavilent to my LG HBS 750 (similar price). On average sound quality (don't expect a strong and clear bass for a wireless headset at this price tag) I would say, but good enough for outdoor running (my main purpose of buying this headset). Press the center button for 1 sec to power up; press the same button for 5 sec to power down. I feel the 5 sec is way too long (3 sec is enough) and the power down sound just don't sound comfortable. It comes with a good-quality quick-open pouch to store the headsets. Very neat! I recommend this product, especially for someone who looks for a very light headset like me.\n"", '\n  These wireless earbuds were a very pleasant surprise. I ordered them for my daughter who had asked for Apple earpods which were a little too extravagant for a tween in my opinion. I did some research and came across these. I tested them out before wrapping them up (they will be a Christmas gift) .... They are amazing! They have adjustable ear cushions, the volume and sound was crisp and clear.  They came charged they were super easy to use and to pair.  I will be getting myself a pair I am that impressed. Save yourself $80 and get Aukey earbuds instead.\n', ""\n  These are some of the best earbuds I've owned to date. They hold their charge without sounding staticky even when the battery runs down. The sound quality is excellent. I was actually surprised when I turned them on the first time with how clear the music was and how powerful the speakers were. Another benefit is that it comes with three sizes of silicone tips, which is great because any earbuds I've ever had came with just one, which inevitably didn't fit in my ear. These do!\n"", '\n  Omg! These ear buds are my newest best friends. The sound quality is phenomenal. I actually have to turn the sound down because if you put it up to high, it gets really loud.The battery life is amazing. I have left them in the case for 4 days and not have to charge the case up after using them 2-3 hours. Its been almost a week since I plugged the case into a charger and I have only lost 25% of the battery.At first I was confused about how to control the music functions but a simple search showed me about the different taps in order to successfully navigate how to control music and incoming calls.""Staying power"" has so far been exceptional. I\'ve had a few head-banging dance parties with these earbuds in and they have yet to fall out. They stay in your ear with the proper foam part with zero problems.As far as the noise-cancelling, it works really well. I usually sleep with a TV on, and when I use my earbuds to hear something on my phone, I hear zero background noise from my television.10/10. Definitely recommend these buds to all my friends looking for a pair of earbuds.\n', ""\n  This is my first ever set of bluetooth earbuds and I am pleased with them. It was easy to follow the instructions for pairing with my phone and the buds stay in place well with the curved attachment. Didn't take long to charge them and I was all set. Package was delivered quickly.\n"", '\n  Love these Bluetooth headphones! They fit nicely in your ears and come with different size earbuds so you can maximize comfort. The battery lasts a good amount of time and the charging dock is slim and sleek. I love the fact they are black so they look really nice with anything. The charging dock is also magnetic so if you open it up and drop it or anything, the earbuds won’t fall out. You can’t beat the price so in case your like me and always misplacing things or have kids who loose stuff, you won’t break your pockets replacing them. Will def be ordering more in the future.\n', '\n  I owned the previous model of this headset. It worked great for me and one day my wife stole it from me.  This blue headset is very eye catching. My previous set was black and I kept losing it  and spent a lot of time looking for it. The color of this headset is so bright that it is hard to miss.  One other area that seems improved is the battery life and connectivity. Battery life can easily last days with heavy usage. Once a while my previous black one lost connection with my phone. I have not yet had this problem since I got it. Overall, I am very satisfied with the purchase.\n', '\n  I bought this for my daughter so she can use it when she go to GYM. It is good quality, easy carry on and it has a small bag to protect the headphone. Volume control is not on the headset which is easier to adjust and see. Best earbuds so far.

The bass is deep, immersive and punchy, just how I like to enjoy my music, especially whilst working. These sit perfectly on my desk, ready for whenever I need them.The case is even a gadget itself.

They surpassed my expectations. Sound quality is very good, no distortion, very loud at the same input level, I find myself running these at least 3 clicks down on volume vs my other headphones on an iPhone.They are quite bass heavy, and suit electronic music well because of this. If run on a flat EQ, they are a bit too heavy on bass and treble and lacking the midrange a bit. I find apples treble reducer EQ works well, the bass booster mode further enhances the bass too much.I’ve run these back to back vs Sennheiser HD280 Pros and some AKG K480s and they really do hold their own, which for this price point is amazing. Admittedly the iPhone struggles to drive the 64ohm HD280s, but even running them via a FIIO DAC they still seem too light on bass. Admittedly driving the HD280 via a proper amp with more EQ control they sound far better, but portability often wins out!The charging case is very handy and battery life easily outlasts the length of time you can comfortably wear these aukeys. I find after an hour plus my ears start to get a little uncomfortable but earbuds usually do that anyway. Three size silicone tips should slow you to get an optimal fit.All in all very good, definitely recommend as the price I paid.\n', ""\n  I got these earbuds for about £18 as they were on a voucher deal, and I have to say that for the price of these earbuds they are really good.You need to make sure you use the right size buds to fit your ear properly to get the noise cancellation, but once you've done that you'll be away.The sound quality is pretty good, quite bassy as long as you turn on your dolby atmos on your phone. I don't have any problems with them.I usually buy more expensive headphones like Marelys but I thought I'd give these a go considering the price, and I'm glad I did.If you want budget earbuds that have good sound quality, noise cancellation and single ear listening functionality, then I'd recommend these. I mean you can't go wrong with the price.\n""]"

No matter how hard I try, they fall out of my ear in less than a minute. I thought I would try a different brand, and when I put these in my ear, they fell out within seconds. I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I’m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!The quality of sound is impeccable, nice highs and lows, with a decent amount of bass.

The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.\n"", '\n  Connected these to my fire stick, which is why I purchased it so I can watch tv while my husband is sleeping. The volume on the ToZo was extremely loud. I wasn’t able to adjust it not even with the tv or fire stick remote. The volume can only be controlled when connected to your phone or tablet. I bought this on Prime Day thinking I was getting a good deal and Paid $49.99 with $3 off but found out other purchase this for around $25/$30. Two stars because they work find when connected to a phone or table but that’s not what I purchased them for.UPDATE REVIEW...This is an update. TOZO Customer service is wonderful they reached out to me to rectify the issue. They issued another TOZO Bluetooth. The previous one works great with my devices just not with my smart tv. Haven’t tried the new one yet but Will keep you posted.  Thanks TOZO\n', ""\n  Every Christmas I usually have enough personal money to make an impulse purchase, usually in Electronics. This year, I wanted to upgrade the $20 pair of totally wireless sound (TWS) earbuds I had. They were good, but needed better sound to make them perfect.With a budget of about $100, I started off looking for something good from a known manufacturer (like Samsung, Jabra, etc.) There was just nothing out there in my price range. I couldn't see myself paying that kind of money from a brand I didn't know, so I started looking for a cheaper model. For around $50 I found 3-4 that looked good and reviews were good enough. I liked Anker's other Bluetooth earphones, so the Soundcore Liberty Lites were considered. With the good reviews and previous good ownership of Monoprice products the Monoprice IPX4s were looking good, too.Due diligence and a desire to be able to use one earbud at a time drive me to search Amazon's best rated under $50 TWS sets, and Tozo looked pretty good. While the buds are labeled L and R, they are both the same, and can be put into either ear. They come with 4 tips, and for the first time, I'm not using the largest ones. So if you have really big ear canals and find it hard to get tips that fit, you may find a good fit here.The sound won't knock Bose out of the water, but for the forty dollars I paid, it is good, and an outstanding upgrade from my $20 pair. It has nice bass, and well defined mids and highs.Battery time is right around 4 hours at low volume (I wear them at work as background noise). The travel case can charge one while the other is playing, so I don't find it hard to get through a work day with them. I like the charging case, too. It's well built, and can use a Qi wireless charger, which I don't care about really. There are 4 lights to tell you how charged it is. it closes and fits in a pocket. I can't tell you how many charges it will take, because I usually keep it plugged in.Pairing, once initially done, is easy. Just pull a bud off the charger and it will turn on and start looking for your paired device. Since I'm using one at a time, I find I need to turn the one I'm using off completely first, then get the other one. I paired them first together, and then separate. This is the best part of these for me, almost seamless use.All in all, very happy with the purchase. And I save up some money to get something else. I have already recommended these to people (my brother is not convinced, he has bone conducting headphones he likes). I do like them that much.\n"", ""\n  \xa0I upgraded from Tozo T8 to the T10 and also own a pair of wireless earbuds from a well known Brand associated with fruit, and have to say I am very impressed with the TOZO T10 in comparison to the other that I own.First of all, They are great value. The set up was very straight forward and connected to my devices bluetooth in a few seconds. When you pick the earbuds up out of the case they automatically attach to each other and have useful light indicators. The case also has light indicators to show the charge level which is very helpful.The waterproof feature is very useful as I'm often worried about headphones if it is raining etc.They fit in my ear nicely and don't fall out as there is a selection of attachment earpiece sizes to best fit the size of your ear.Nice presentation in the box and good clear instructions.The sound is really nice, I have listened to a selection of songs and audiobooks etc and the sound is up there with some of the best sounding earbuds I've used, very clear with good sound range / overall levels and I'd definitely recommend them!The sound range distance is good, I walked downstairs in my home and continued to listen to the headphones no problem (under 10 metres).The case and earbuds feel very premium, there is even a lanyard included for carrying around your neck or hanging on a hook etc.For the price you can't go wrong, also supports wireless charging which I might have to try out as well!I've added an unboxing video plus some photos to help show what's included too.Thanks for reading my review and hopefully this might've helped in your decision to try out these brilliant headphones if you do decide to get these. Happy listening!\n"", ""\n  So I bought these headphones for a single purpose - use in the hot tub (I already use AirPods for running/exercise and some noise-cancelling Bose headphones for when I'm at work)... I have to admit they were a bit of a shot-in-the-dark and I honestly wasn't expecting much from them, especially as I used to have some cheaper headphones for running that were terrible, and really put me off the 'budget' price point.Now these are clearly not AirPod or Bose standard, but frankly for the price they sound excellent. Crystal clear treble and more than enough low-end for me... using my go to track (Wilderness from Clannad's Anam) they have good definition and far exceeded my expectations.They are much larger than AirPods, and you MUST ensure they are correctly positioned (with the right-sized rubber ends on) or the sound quality drops dramatically - but after a few minutes of getting this right (as a one off) they more than meet the requirements. The size isn't really a hinderance to them, because it lets them sit in the ears quite comfortably - but your mileage might vary (with ear size).I haven't had them long enough to gauge battery life, but the wireless charging feature of the case works fine from my standard charging mat.So the TL;DR... really good value for money and surprisingly high sound quality - Recommend!(For full disclosure they cost £29.99 when I bought them and TOZO have offered me an extra wireless charger, no strings attached - but the later has not influenced my review, other than encouraging me to write it).\n"", ""\n  I bought these to take on holiday to Spain, I intended lots of beach and poolside music listening and didn't fancy the wires or bulkiness of my existing headphones. In ear and wire free was a must and having compared many of the headphones on Amazon I ended up choosing these.I wasn't expecting much for the price paid, but first impressions were very positive. The packaging is excellent and suggests premium quality. The charging case is much sturdier than I imagined and the earbuds themselves smaller than I imagined (in a good way).I used the earbuds and charging case daily whilst on holiday for anything from 1-5 hours at a time without any issue. The sound quality is surprisingly very good, a much better bass than I was expecting. Everything seemed nice and clear. I never intended to keep using them daily on my return from holiday, but I have. They are fine when walking too, I expected them to fall out but they don't. I'm not sure I'd trust running in them though.The jury is still out on the long term longevity and battery life a few months down the line, but I'll be happy to revisit this review and update it in a few months if my opinion changes.\n"", '\n  The sound cancellation is really amazing, I couldn’t hear anything else but my music.The quality is good in itself, I had another pair of wireless earphones and it made me unsure if I should buy another pair as the sound quality want good, but these are amazing.They’re easy to use and connected to my phone within seconds, overall really love these\n', '\n  \xa0I have to say these ear buds are great quality both made and for comfort worked straight out of the box and you can even carge the box with a QI wireless charging pad or through the cable it has different size ear buds for comfort and ive included a small video but if your thinking of buying some then just spend a little bit more and buy these because the sound quality is great\n']"

I am a professional musician by trade and these have incredibly clear sound quality, really high end parts put into this product.The connection is fast and easy, it charges while in the case which is a great feature but better than all these features I love the ability to wear them in the shower and jam to tunes while they get soaked and survive it like a champ. Really high end headphones for a amazingly good price. I would recommend these to anyone looking for Bluetooth headsets similar to those made by Apple but for a far less price and also BETTER bass response!!The touch controls on the side are fantastically good if you wanted to pause music or youtube at work when someone asks you a question so you can hear them without taking the headset out. They are incredibly good at isolating and even at the lowest volume they can shut out the world around you. I wear them everywhere and love them so much.They come with a charge case, 3 extra sets of ear tips to fit whatever size ear you have, a charge cable for charging the case (micro usb) and a one year warrantee!Do yourself a favor and get a set of these superb Bluetooth earbuds!Did I mention they are waterproof?! IPX8 Waterproof!!\n', ""\n  This is the second time I reviewed this company's products. I'm sort of a earbud Junkie, and make a lot of purchases. About six months ago I purchased the older version of these headphones, and fell in love. I was looking on Amazon to see what other products this company had, and if there was any new versions. I was pleasantly surprised to see be upgraded version of headphones so I found a reason to order the newest set by giving my children my old set. I work in construction and listen to audio books all day long keep from going crazy , my job is incredibly boring. Because my job keeps me from home for such a longperiod. I only use one earbud at a time. I insert the first one around 3 a.m. and begin my stories, I swap it out around lunch and the second one last me until 4:30 in the afternoon when I get home. In the past with other brands I've had I'd have to swap out my earbuds about every 2 hours, not with these. The newest version that I'm reviewing is even better than the last, both in battery power, insound, an ability to connect to my phone. One problem that I've noticed I've had in the past with the charging boxes is that the magnets are almost never strong enough to keep the earbud from falling off while charging, this newest version has an incredibly strong making. It doesn't help that I have fat fingers then make it difficult for me to grasp small things. Hahaha, they did a great job we're including super strong magnets they will ensure that these earbuds keep charging for the next use. I threw my phone in one of my back pockets of my pants and this new version ensures you don't lose connection no matter which way you turn your head. They're incredibly loud and clear so that when you're in a noisy environment you can still hear what you're listening to. It took me a moment to get use to the fact that the buttons are touch activated rather than traditional buttons, but I quickly became acustomed to brushing the face of the earphone. Its nice as now when I set them in my ear I dont knock them out when trying to pause my audiobooks when people are trying to talk to me. In my last review of this company's products I said they have a customer for life, and I gladly say it again.\n"", '\n  Update: After about a year of use, we ran into some trouble with these headphones. They are constantly disconnecting from bluetooth and one of the earbuds is super quiet. I messaged Tozo to inquire about the warranty, and they are sending a full replacement. Two thumbs up for their customer service!I have a young teenage son who wanted a pair of AirPods, as he was sick of headphones with wires. I was unwilling to get him something so expensive, so we compromised with these, as it won’t be as big of a deal if he loses them!I already own and love a pair of Tozo T-10s, but he wanted a pair with a much smaller case that will fit in his pocket at school. These fit the bill! They’re about 1/4 inch wider and just slightly taller than airpods. He’s super happy with the size.The lid is magnetic and closes with an audible clack just like AirPods. Apparently my teen thinks this is important, ha ha.Charging via a charging pad works great. My son really likes the four bright lights that tell him how much charge is left. He says he’s used them all week and hasn’t had to recharge his case yet.The sound seems good. My son has no complaints whatsoever. I borrowed them for a few hours to listen to podcasts, and the sound was good for that.One thing that I wish was like the T-10 is that it does not appear that you can pair one earbud to one device, and the other earbud to another device.  My phone just recognizes these as Tozo-T6. The T-10s show as Tozo-T10-R (or L), which allows me to pair them as two separate devices. I wish this had that. But my son could care less, as he doesn’t own more than one device. :)Overall, my son loves these and is totally happy to have these and not AirPods. The model number suggests that maybe it’s a lower mode number than the T-10, but I think these actually might be a newer, upgraded version.\n', '\n  \xa0I have been using this earbuds for sometime now and these are perfect!. I was able to use this for long hours without getting ear pain. Sound quality is absolutely amazing and its very easy to carry in your pocket while traveling. I highly recommend this product.\n', ""\n  Let’s face it, if anyone is looking to buy a pair of in ear wireless headphones then opting for the Apple AirPods is where almost all of us would start looking. But with so many other options now on the market is there something that is able to do the job (or even a better job) for a fraction of the cost....we’ll, yes there is!The Tozo T6 headphones are a great option for anyone looking for their first delve into wireless headphone territory.Firstly the form factor is great, they don’t have the annoying stick down the side of the ear unlike Apple AirPods, these are confined to your actual ear, if you wear a scarf it means you won’t dislodge these, and with a true in ear seal, which is made even better with so many ear cup options they fit very snugly without being tight or uncomfortable. the case also mirrors the Apple style with magnets to hold them into place with a handy charge light on the case, the nicely clicking opening hinge further gives joy when opening the up, one minor gripe is that they can be a bit fiddly to get out, but I’ve always managed.Functionality of these is also excellent, you can play, pause, skip, rewind, even turn volume up and down with only the touch to the headphones (something which is way ahead of the apple ones) They even speak back to you what option you’ve selected which is very helpful so you know if it’s understood what you've asked for.Sound quality is excellent for a pair of wireless headphones, especially at the price point. The fact that they seal completely in your ear gives great passive noise cancellation, and although when playing some songs they can be a little soft in the mid and lacking in base, just tweaking Spotify’s EQ to bass boost gives a lovely rich warm sound which is excellent.I can’t comment on battery life as yet, but other users seem impressed, and Tozo Claim 5 hours of music playback, which is far longer than my 1 hour commute so it’s fine for my (and probably most peoples) needs.As seen on the photo they come with micro USB charging case and instructions, but are very easy to set up and pair straight from the box.In summary these are an excellent pair of headphones from a sound, comfort, form factor and the all important, price point. Would definitely recommend them.(And for those wondering, yes I do own a pair of Apple AirPods too...)\n"", '\n  Really nice product. I couldnt justify spending £150+ on apple airpods when these looked so appealing especially the price! The reviews on amazon were all very positive so i thought i would give them a try. I havnt been left disappointed... this product in my eyes is just as good as any other on the market. They fit perfectly and come with alternative ear sizing pieces where you can change them to whatever suits your ear for comfort. Really happy... going to buy another pair for my partner.\n', '\n  I\'ve used wireless earbuds for a while, and I\'m generally a fan of my B&O E8 2.0s. However, I have been shopping around for a while for new earbuds to use as a backup for a few reasons:- The leather case on the B&Os feels premium, but it\'s not exactly practical for the gym- Connectivity on the B&O is not perfect when on the move, especially when your phone is close to your bodyBeing broadly satisfied with TOZO products (love their screen protectors for my Samsung Note 9), I decided to give these wireless earbuds a chance. They came promptly. The box has a real premium feel, and the earbuds are nicely packed inside, with the standard plastic protection you would expect from a premium product. Algotether, the presentation feels more Apple-y than I was expecting (which is a really good thing!).Taking the wrapper off of the case, it\'s very similar in size, shape & design to the Airpod case (which was the obvious inspiration). I was a little disappointed -- but not surprised -- to see a Micro-USB port on the bottom instead of a USB-C port; however, wireless charging works as advertised. The case shape is also nice because it\'s not as thick as the ""losenge"" case of the E8s -- it\'s much easier to slip into a pocket.When you take the buds out of the case for the first time, they immediately drop into pairing mode, and I was paired and running in less than 30 seconds. My phone reports they prefer to stream in AAC, which is kind of what you would expect for buds in this price range.In terms of signal strength and stability of connection, these blow the B&Os completely out of the water. With the B&Os, if I had my phone in the back left pocket, the signal would drop the moment I moved to a noisy environment. With the TOZO pair, the connection stays solid and reliable.In terms of audio quality, I\'m no audiophile but the TOZOs are clearly more bass-heavy than my E8s -- this actually makes them nicer for pop and mainstream music in certain scenarios. I\'ve also taken a few calls on these and my voice has come through without much issue (which is actually an improvement on the E8s, which aren\'t known for their microphone quality).All told, these are good ""starter"" earbuds, and also a good companion for someone who may have a much pricier set which they don\'t want to take to the gym / in the rain. They are excellent value for the price.\n', ""\n  I have been searching for ages for some Bluetooth earphones which are waterproof/sweatproof, have good sound quality and are similar to Airpods in design without the Apple price. Well look no further, these tick all the boxes!They look great and much more expensive than they are. The charging case is perfect and works well to keep them charged up and has LED lights on the front to indicate how much charge it has left. In terms of the headphone design, I was worried that they would fall out all the time, especially as I wanted to use them for running, but with all the different size ear pieces, I found a perfect fit and so far they haven't budged. It takes a little bit of getting used to if you haven't used similar in-ear headphones before but they fit well and are comfortable to wear for a prolonged amount of time. Just make sure to place them in and twist them for a secure fit. The sound is of a really good quality with a good bass and is good at cancelling background noise. The touch function to change and pause songs works smoothly and is simple, with just a slight delay from command to it doing what you've asked. Pairing the device was so simple and once you've paired once it will remember your device. You can turn on/off both earpieces individually so make sure you have turned both on to get the sound in both - you can also used just one ear piece if you would like.These are a really great product, especially for the price! Just be aware they do not come with a charger so I have been on the hunt for a micro-USB cable and will eventually buy their wireless charging pad - another pro of them is that they support wireless charging. Another positive is how quick the delivery was - ordered them Sunday evening and received them by lunchtime Monday.\n"", '\n  -I wanted a bit of time to test these out properly before reviewing so a few weeks later here goes:-Fast delivery and in good quality packaging (not excessive)-I purchased the white headphones, they look and feel great quality for the cost and the colour seems slightly pearlised which I love!-Worked straight out of the box and has an 18month warranty sticker included to register-Sound quality is great - I like quite bass heavy music (RnB, Dancehall, House) as well as classical and some rock so I tested a wide variety of music genres and also films and I am impressed with the quality in comparison to bigger brands used, the bass is just right and all sounds seem crisp and clear and the volume is more than sufficient unless you really want to wreck your eardrums!-Love the wireless charging feature and it’s so fast too, the headphones held a good 4+hrs continuous charge on highest volume for me which I think is excellent-Headphones feel really stable in your ears (several buds to chose from so should fit majority of people well)-Very touch responsive and really easy to operate-Tested falls on them too and whilst I don’t really use them for this often it worked well enough and was clear for me and the other caller-I was able to move around the entire house and into the garden and not lose any sound quality-These are excellent true wireless headphones for the price and I have and would definitely recommend them!\n']"

Admittedly, there may be a setting I need to check on my computer to make sure these are correctly set up. And AT&T....Conclusion: I really like these, and they're quickly becoming my go-to wireless earbuds, especially for music. I have used them with my Note8, my work desktop PC, and my Surface. I'll update this review if needed.\n"", '\n  I received an offer to receive these earbuds free in exchange for an honest review. I already have an older model set of Powerbeats, which are great, but they have a wire between the two buds, and ear hooks. I don\'t want ear hooks. I really hate that the Powerbeats are jammed into my ear. These Mpows were supposed to nicely rest inside my ear, so I was, like, ""Okay, what the heck, I\'ll give them a try.""My primary uses for any of my earbuds/headsets is (1) Zoom meetings and classes, (2) audiobook listening while walking and playing disc golf, (3) talking on the phone. Obviously I don\'t need the microphone to listen to a book, but it\'s very important for me to be understood during meetings and phone calls, so the mic is very important to me. In fact, the Powerbeats were the first near-the-ear microphone earbuds that I found to be acceptable. Well, now I\'ve added the Mpows to that category!While my voice is a bit thin via the Mpow microphone, thinner than via my built-in Pixel3 phone mic, but not by much. The audio quality the microphone supplies is very much, in fact, on a par with the much-more-expensive Powerbeats.Also, the Mpows stay in my ears while I\'m moving, shaking my head, throwing discs. That stability is assisted, I\'m sure, by the thin silicone covers they come with. Plus they are so light and comfortable. It\'s easy to forget they are there.As for audio quality, I like it better than my Powerbeats. I\'m guessing that is probably because the Mpows fit my ears better, and don\'t need to be jammed in there. The bass is acceptable, and I really don\'t expect HD sound via such a tiny device. I have over-the-ear headphones for that. I will say for the record that when simply resting in my ears as designed, these Mpows sound better than any of the other eight sets of earbuds I have tried.The volume and other controls are simple touches that I had to learn. Tbh, I like actual buttons better, but there\'s no way to put those on such a delightfully tiny device. The controls work very well, so I\'m not complaining at all.The only thing negative I can say about these earbuds is that I hear a very subtle white noise during silent times, but the noise is so low as not to be distracting, nor is it unexpected for me with wireless headsets.I attach these Mpows to both my Pixel3 and Mac M1 MacBook Pro. They work well, connecting easily.I haven\'t run the earbuds out of battery yet, as I put them back into the nice little recharging case between uses. Very convenient and very compact, and the recharge connections are magnetized, so the earbuds grab onto them. I also like that the plug for the recharger is the same rounded USB that connects to my other newest devices.All in all, I highly recommend these earbuds for the activities I tested them with. They\'re comfortable, they\'re tiny, and they\'re a great value!\n', '\n  I have the M30 and M9 headphones in addition to this pair the MX3 that I just got. The sound on this model is probably the most crisp and clear out of all of them. The Bass is great for headphones.The headphones fit well in my ear, but might not fit everyone the same so this one size for all model might not be great for you if you have larger or smaller than average ear canals.The M9 and M30 had very poor call quality so I was very happy when I tested these MX3 earbuds with a quick call to my wife and they actually sound great. Crisp and very clear. This is the first Mpow earphone model that I’ve tried that I would actually recommend not just for music, but phone calls also.MPow balances price with quality better than perhaps any other headphones I’ve tried and the MX3 is no exception. A great pair of earbuds for 30 bucks. They come with a two year warranty also, but I haven’t had any issues with the M30 or M9 that I’ve had for about a year now so I expect no problems with these MX3 earbuds.I like the sleek white design too.\n']"

These earbuds get ⭐🤩⭐⭐ solely for bang for the buck and the quality.  While these aren't airpods or pixel buds, they are still excellent.

Midranges can sound a little muddy- touch sensitivity can cause accidental actions if you're readjusting the earbudsI already own a pair of MPOW headphones (Flame 2) and had them go bad after about 8 months.  I contacted support.  They were very responsive and shipped out a new pair of headphones to me.  Their service is great!\n"", '\n  The Mpow Mbits are my third Mpow earbud purchase. My family uses their the Mpow M9 & M30 almost daily, primarily for music and watching sports/Netflix on iPad. The Mbits are top quality like the other two we have. They come with a great charging case, charge quickly, and hold the charge for several days/plays.The sound quality is great, I find the M30 to be more noise canceling than the Mbits due to the design. I find the Mbits to be more versatile, the stem design allows me to pop them in/out quickly if I need to during a walk.  The volume feature is great, easy to manipulate up and down with touch. I can listen to music low and still be aware of my surroundings, or turn it up to lose myself in a tune. The touch features are easy to use (each Mpow pair we have work the same, so no confusion going from paint to pair). Mic feature works very well on Mbits, answering a phone call on the go and video chats online work with out a glitch.I take these everywhere and like that they always have a charge and I’m prompted by the battery lights when to plug in for a quick charge!I am very pleased with the Mpow earbuds quality, battery life and sound. The fit is great too, I have small ears and they stay put.\n', ""\n  Received the MPOW Mbit S's and put them to the test.  I have a pair of the MPOW M9's and also Apple Airpods (original, not Pro).  The Mbit S's are by far the best of the 3 and my new favorite earbuds.  I have always gone back and forth on earbuds with the silicon tip's.  The older Mpow M9's never quite fit right and were a bit too big (see photos).  This is what caused me to switch to Apple Airpods, however, I didn't love the lack of a good seal with the Apple's  The new Mbit S's fit much much better and have a perfect seal for noise cancellation.  Mpow also made the case smaller with the S's and I love that too!Everything about the Mbit S's are better than the M9's.  I'll try to break it down.  First, the fit is excellent.  They provide various silicone tips for different ear types, but it is the entire ear piece that is smaller and more well balanced.  Second, the touch control is far better than the M9's.  Hold touch on right for volume up, left for volume down.  Double tap right for next song, left for repeat last song. Triple tap for siri.  Third, the case size is perfect, not too big and not too small.  The Apple Airpod case always feels like I am going to lose it, but the new Mbis S is just right.  Forth, the sound is excellent.  The bass is good and the treble tones are well balanced.  I think the sound is superior to the Airpod's!!  The noise cancellation is very good...it is not going to be as good as an over the ear headphone and is probably a bit less than the Airpod pro's (I have tried them and the noise cancellation is very nice).  The battery life on the Mbits are excellent and I love the USB C charge on the case.The only thing that is still to determine is longevity.  But at this price point, you could buy these 4 to 5 times before you hit the Apple pricing.  I highly recommend and have already bought some as gifts for friends.\n"", '\n  Really happy with these earbuds. My partner gifted them to me since I’ve been looking around for a good pair for a while now. I also have smaller sized ears and like that they came with alternate sized buds to replace the standard size as well. They fit snug and are comfortable in my ear for long periods of time, which has always been an issue for me in the past.The sound is crisp and smooth and the tap features are really responsive. Overall very happy with this!\n', '\n  \xa0I got these wireless headphones to use for watching movies and tv shows with my friends via video chat programs during the pandemic. The sound quality is great! Music, sound effects, and voices are very clear. They are extremely easy to use and pair to your devices. I love the battery life! The case even has a built in battery so when you store them, they charge automatically. They are comfortable to wear as well.One of my favorite features is that audio comes through both earbuds when you use them to make a phone call. Other earbuds do not have this feature. They do an excellent job of noise cancelling as well. I highly recommend these!\n', '\n  I have been using these for a few days. Here are my thoughts.They came charged straight out of the box, which was great. Connecting is frustration-free! Once initially paired, the moment I take the earphones out of the charging unit, its connected to my phone.They feel like good quality. Unlike other wireless earphones I have used in the past, these feel solid. They fit comfortably into the ear and the sound is clear and impressive.You can charge them in the box which comes with a handy indicator showing how much juice is left. When in use, a handy voice informs you that your earphones are running low on battery and need to be charged.Another good thing is they are solid so have a little weight to them. That means, I can feel if I am not wearing one earphone or if one has fallen out (this rarely happens though). Unlike some I have used in the past which are so light, I have to trace my steps to see where it fell out!Overall, I highly recommend these as a solid, well-built wireless earphones with crisp sound and no frustrations.\n', ""\n  As I now own both the Mpow Mbits and M30s I thought I'd do a quick review covering the differences.First thing to say is they are both fantastic so you won't be disappointed whichever ones you go for, however, they are quite different and here's how...Sound - to my ears, the Mbits have a warmer sound with more bass and softer highs. The M30s have a brighter high end, slightly more scooped out mids and more precise sound (still plenty of bass). The Mbits have a more immediate and emersive sound with LOADS of bass.Wearability - the Mbits are loads easier to take out the case, easier to put in and take out of your ears and more comfortable to wear over long periods. However, because of the 'fins', the M30s are more stable and stay in better (they are not going anywhere once they are in! ). Note - If you have tiny ears the Mbits are likely to fit better than the M30s.Battery - I've not been able to test this properly yet as i've only had the Mbits a week, but the battery life is supposed to be much better on the Mbits. I've not had to charge the case at all yet which is a good sign. The 5 lights on the case that indicate level of charge are more intuitive than the single light on the M30s case which changes colour to indicate level of charge.Overall - if you are a bass head and/or you are going to be taking them in and out of your ears or the case a lot, the Mbits are the ones for you.If you are looking for Bluetooth headphones that are going to stay put no matter what (e.g. for exercise) and/or you like crispy bright highs and a balenced sound, go for the M30s.... Or get both like me!\n"", '\n  Definitely wasn’t expecting it to be so good for the price I paid.I own another pair of mpow earbuds and really like them. The only issue I had with my previous earphones was with the size of the buds (a bit too bulky) and that I struggled to keep them in my ears (not sure why!)But .. this ones solve all those issues!Fit my ears perfectly, won’t come out when I went for a quick run, easy to change song and volume and to pause and restart.If the battery is the same as my other mpow earphones (which seems like) it is just amazing.I use them intermittently but only had to charge the small box once (in more than a month!)Also, the charge and carry box is super small and portable. Charge and carry At the same time - just perfect.Overall, super happy with my purchase and recommended it 100%\n', ""\n  The Good:• Extremely compact design (small and smooth case makes handling quick and easy)• Fast and simple automatic pairing (after initial pairing)• Lightweight and comfortable (you can easily forget about them being in your ears)• Great battery performance (6 hours for buds, +29 hours for charging case)• 'Mono' mode allows for a single earbud to be used (great for when you want more awareness)• USB-C charging port (most 'budget' devices use Micro-USB)The Bad:• No wireless charging for the case, which would allow these buds to be truly 100% wireless• As with most touch controls, accidental activation can occur when adjusting buds once in-ear\n"", ""\n  One of the best wireless earphone you can get for bargain price. Sound and build quality is compareble to airpods.I got these small earbuds to use while working from home, they are pretty sleek and work great! Voice calls quality over Slack, Webex, Google Meet, etc have worked perfectly, people comment they can hear me very well and don't complain about background noise.I absolutely love the fact that they connect to and disconnect from your device automatically, and also that they automatically switch on when you remove them from the case, and switch off when you put them back in.These Mpow earbuds works great - sound quality is awesome, very responsive to a tap controls, black matt colour and best of all - great value for money.Finally, there's the added bonus of a USB-C charging port (hurray!) which is a good match for most modern chargers.Can't really go wrong at this price point.\n""]"

I consider myself a bit of an audiophile and have most of my music ripped to 24-bit lossless files (usually flac) and use high-end players for that media.  I have expensive WIRED earbuds and had found wireless earbuds severely lacking in audio-quality.  Manufacturers seemed to focus on other aspects of wireless earbuds -- battery life OR size OR mass-marketing their brand name.  But someone mentioned this brand so I idly checked them out.  They were inexpensive enough to try out -- Amazon\'s always been great at quickly accepting returns  and I\'m not shy about letting them know. So... why not?  They arrived quickly (yay Amazon Prime!) and I was immediately impressed with the packaging -- nice first-impression from a brand I\'d never hear of before.  The authenticity label with the QR-code was a confidence-booster.  The buds themselves fit snugly inside a tiny (portable!) clamshell case.  They get drawn into their storage/charging sockets with fairly strong magnets. No worries about misaligning them. They automatically  start charging when in -- the case itself has a built-in battery that can be charged via a USB-C plug OR QI WIRELESS CHARGING!  Another VERY welcome feature ... my family has wireless charging pads throughout the house.  I even took a pic of it charging wirelessly!  Note the LEDS on the front indicating how far-along the CASE is charged. Nice. :)  After ensuring they were fully-charged (Didn\'t take long -- they came mostly charged) I paired them very easily to my player.  The sound was INCREDIBLE!  Really ... far, far better than any other wireless earbuds I\'d tried.  I gave the touch-sensitive buttons a try to pause, skip, rewind, increase volume, etc.  They worked great -- very responsive. I was very happy and wore them around the house for over 3 hours doing chores.  They were great!  My player showed after 3 CONSTANT hours the batteries were still reporting 75% filled. Wow!  I let them snap back into their very sturdy case, they started recharging and were topped-off & ready after an hour or so.  The next day I used them a lot more paired to my Samsung Galaxy S8  -- about 5 hours of running (including up & down stairs).  A call from my mom conveniently helped me test their phone-capabilities.  They were outstanding!  Folks would complain my voice sounded muted or echo-y using other earbuds so I\'d remove them to talk, but she said I sounded like I always did (without ANY earbuds) and I heard HER perfectly from both sides!  A VERY unexpected bonus!  These are now, also, my go-to phone earbuds. After 5+ hours of non-stop music and about 30-minutes of phone-calls, my phone reported these ENACFIRE E60s had 50% battery left.  I was a little surprised that the box claims a ""Working Distance: 10M (barrier-free)"" for the Bluetooth V5.  Seemed like a lot.  They worked FINE when my phone (using BT5) was 3-5 meters away but when I moved to a tiny half-bath less than 3 meters away and closed the thin, hollow door the sound started sputtering.  Normally not a big deal if one keeps their player/phone in a pocket.  Also... someone else mentioned ... the buttons on the earbuds are marked with a largish L or R indicating their side.  I\'d have preferred it be smaller or be less obvious.  Just a minor, vain annoyance and hardly worth mentioning.  After almost 3 weeks of heavy, daily use I\'m still VERY happy with these earbuds!  If anything arises that concerns me, I\'ll be sure to update this ""review"" especially since I\'ve obviously put so much into it. Sorry it\'s SO long ... I\'m just very pleased with these and have already recommended them to 3 friends who\'ll probably buy them too.  It was money well-spent!\n', ""\n  I've been using enafire wireless earbuds for almost a week now, prior to these buda, my favorite were the earfun free ones. These totally took over to become my new fav for a couple of obvious reasons.Enacfire literally check every single of my boxes .Aptx support, wireless case charging capability, and compact! Check the the overally case size when comparr to my previous fav buds.Sounds quality is excellent for the price, thank goodness for aptx support. These buds came a bit too punchy for my taste, glad they response to EQ pretty well. No complaint about battery life, almost a week, and haven't charge it once since the first full charge.Noise cancellation is so much better and almost too much. I have a kid in the house, so I only use one bud on most of the time.There's a couple of quirky things about these buds, one is when you try to use single bud mode, you have to pair them individually. If you don't want to mess up the sync in pair mode, just use the left ear bud in single mode so that you don't have to sync them all overall again. Given my personal experience, I had to re-pair and sync both of the earbuds with the phone every single time I tried to use the right bud in solo mode. Ive gotten tires of that, and just use the left bud ik solo.  In short, if you want to save some unnecessary pairing, make sure take the left ear bud out first.I want to emphasize that I love the fit of these buds, come with 6 pairs of ear tips, 3 SML in white and also in dark gray. The design of the buds is there it goes in the ear and not just sit on the ear like most of the TWS.  I haven't have the experience of the buds falling out. Also, these do not stick out, it's low profile.These are officially my new fav pair of budget TWS. Maybe some new color collection for the future upgraded model would be nice.\n"", ""\n  The overall quality, feature, and design of the ENACFIRE E60 completely outperformed apple earbuds. Its Beautiful, portable, and minimalistic design, which is a big plus for me, especially on hikes. Perfectly fits well in the ear where it wouldn't fall off easily despite vigorous movementsNever had any lag or delay with the V5.0 Bluetooth(Maximum range is 10-15meter)The touch feature is completely ahead of its time where it eliminated hard annoying buttons.The touch feature includes all necessary media control settings like the pause and play button, volume -/+, and previous/next.Including a 2 year warranty!I'm overall happy with this product!Would purchase again!\n"", '\n  Pros:- Overall for the price they are pretty good.-there is decent base- very noise cancelling-wrestled with the dog and they didnt fall out-so far 6 hours continous music with good sound/no static/cutting in or outCons:- bluetooth range isnt great compared to other brands that i have used.- pairing with devices is challenging- using touch features to turn off/on, volume, etc are not reliable and difficult to use. (So far laying on my ears in bed or wearing a beanie has not triggered the touch function- others have complained about this)- Powered down without placing back in the box (i got the verbal shutdown notification) and somehow turned on in the morning when my alarm went off. Not good if your not wearing them.I understand the touch function maybe related to a learning curve on a new device so I\'m going to try them a little bit longer.Update:After having the product for 4 days i returned them. The touch functions are incredibly frustrating to use and inconsistent. Phone calls echo. The earphones never truely turned off unless they are put into the case. I really liked the fit, case, and noise cancelling but the functions are a deal breaker.******Update: I\'m not impressed that I was offered a bribe of free earphones ""to “Delete” or “Edit 5 stars."" The company has emailed me 3 times since my review offering free earphones in exchange for 5 start rating.Let me be clear. This item didnt work for me and my reasons are the same for other buyers. This item may work for you and amazon has exteneded returns if it doesnt. Companies offering free stuff for 5 star reviews are shady and why its so hard to shop online.I bought the Monster 100 Airlinks from Amazon and I love them.\n', ""\n  I have had a few pairs of wireless EarBuds (I lose them) so when I was replacing my last set I had a checklistLatests Qualcom processor, checkAll day battery life, checkUSB C charger socket, checkWireless charging, checkBattery life indicator, check.These fulfill every want on my list but if they didn't sound good it would be worth nothing, its great then that the sound is brilliant. The bass is full and deep the highs crisp and detailed.The grey colour I bought isn't a cheap coloured plastic, it's a nice painted finish, they feel and look expensive, the charging box is held shut with a good strength magnet.I know I'm waxing lyrical but for the cost these are brilliant, in fact for half as much again they would still be a steal.The only thing I was a little hesitant about was the white making on each ear bud but with a little car cutting polish and some careful cleaning I managed to remove it.I can recommend these very highly and will be taking extra care not to lose them, I don't want to replace them except with another pair the same! Brilliant little buds of listening pleasure.\n"", '\n  SUMMMARY:  5-star customer support, but 3-stars for product.I started with the Enacfire60.  After 16 days owning them, the left headphone suddenly decided to not play music above a most minimal volume (I thought at first it had stopped working altogether), while the right is at full blast.  For the two weeks they worked, they were great, but I had to return them.UPDATE:  Based on this review, their customer team reached out to me, and offered to send me a new pair free of charge, which turned out to be the newer version (Enacfire90).  The customer team was kind, and the replacement came promptly.After a few weeks of use, I can say the sound in the Enacfire90 is better than the Enacfire60, and both pods still work reliably.  However, they do not stay in-ear as well as the Enacfire60.  I have found if you touch them to re-seat them in your ear while running, it pauses the music, which then does not easily un-pause with another touch.  Therefore, you can wind up shutting off music anytime the headphones become loose, which is pretty frequently in my case (and I had the same result with all the differently-sized silicone earbud covers it came with).\n', '\n  I was a bit sceptical about whether this type of headphone would be as good as people say, and felt sure they\'d be uncomfortable or constantly fall out of my ears... but no, they\'re actually very good! I do think that ""complex"" music that builds up, for instance with multiple electric guitars, is a little less clear compared to my phone\'s wired ear buds, but for price point and convenience, it\'s not the end of the world. If I had a lot more money to spare, I would have bought top quality, high end ear buds but, realistically,  these are more than adequate for my needs. They\'re absolutely fine for listening to podcasts or ""talkie"" YouTube videos.For anyone who, like me, was trying to ascertain if these also worked as a hand-free phone headset, they do, though it\'s not clear from the blurb. I have spoken to a few people using just one ear bud and no one yet has said, terrible line, can\'t hear you, so I presume they\'re fine! Sound quality is ok from my end too.The charging box is small, neat and protective, and it fits easily into my small handbag. Battery life great so far. Loving the white ones too as they match my phone and just feel a bit less clunky. All in all, a great buy. I often used to walk around with phone in pocket and wired earbuds in, while I was doing jobs around the house. It nearly ended in disaster a few times when I accidentally got caught on door or drawer handles! Just be warned though, if you have both ear buds in, even with your music reasonably quiet, they make such excellent ear plugs, that your teenagers will accuse you of not listening to them... oops!\n']"
