Also the 2nd M.2 slot does show up if you put a NVME in there (not sure about SATA m.2 as I didn’t have one to test). It is standard 80mm size, same as the main slot, and seems to have extra room above/below it so I believe something double sided would fit, as would something with a SMALL heatsink on top (like say the Adata Swordfish one).Screen:Most of the other gaming laptops in the $750-1100 range have dim ~250 nit screens with awful <50% color gamuts. This one, 300nit rated (~330 actual based on reviews) 144hz and 100% srgb. It is striking, you won’t find a screen like this in this price range elsewhere.Power:Then you have a 8c/16t 4800H processor, which netted just under 4700 on Cinebench R20 in Performance Mode. For reference, my desktop running a Ryzen 3700X 8c/16t scores between 4600 and 4800 depending on background software and performance settings.Memory:The ram is ideal, 3200mhz, 16gb, you don’t want any less because that’s the lower limit for gaming and productivity, and you don’t want any more because each 8gb is about 3watts of power consumption. Not sure if it supports 32gb, I can’t see 16gb being the limit but the Lenovo Support responders in Q&A here seem to think it is.Battery.:It would be nice if they had any prebuilt options with the 80wh version, but they don’t, and I took a star off for that. Most of us would gladly pay an extra $50+ for that option. And I don’t feel like waiting 5+ weeks (2 months? 3?) for a custom one just to get it. That being said, with proper settings this 60wh can be sufficient.*Quiet Mode (fn+q until power led turns blue)*Battery Save mode on (click on battery icon, slide all the way to left)*Hybrid Mode on (this is ESSENTIAL, it shuts off the dedicated graphics card when not needed)*In Advanced Power Settings, adjust all of the AMD, Wireless, etc settings to their most ‘battery saving’ optionDoing all that I’m getting over 5 hours browsing the internet, longer if I have the internet open and am mostly working in excel or word (ie: normal school work/reports for office/etc). For instance, editting this review in the Amazon window, 4.1 hours remaining w/ 55% (7.5 hours total est). 7-8 hours watching Youtube @720p in Edge. Brightness at whatever battery saver drops it to when it’s on high to begin with. I intend on trying to swap in an 80wh when the parts are available.Build quality:The fit/finish and overall feel of the unit hits above its price point. The keyboard is exceptional for productivity, aside from the slightly cramped numpad. The touchpad is responsive. The rear I/O ports are great for desktop duty. But lets be real, Lenovo doesn’t exactly have a great reputation when it comes to customer service and turnaround times for repairs. None of the laptop manufacturers do though really, save Apple. My last Lenovo, a Y700, lasted over 5 years. I figure, get it, do some stress testing on the processor/GPU (Cinebench, Furmark), watch some movies and do some white/black backgrounds to check for dead pixels, and cross your fingers. To extend warranty through them is $50/100/175 for 1/2/3 extra years respectively, I personally am planning at least the $50 for an extra year.Heat:There is one drawback, this thing gets hot. I was expecting better thermals as I tested out a Legion 5 with the 4600H + 1650ti combo a while back. I would say this one runs ~5c average hotter across the board, and will spike to 95-100C+ if you’re doing something intense like Cinebench or Flight Sim 2020. In Flight Sim, average CPU temps over a 20 min flight were ~76c, CPU Die avg was ~85C. Temps are lower playing less demanding games, and even normally demanding games like AC Origins CPU avg was low 70’s, so not terrible. I spent some time looking into this, and apparently these hopped up gaming laptops hitting 90-100C is ‘okay’, even if I don’t really like or trust it. Also, the only option I know of that actually runs cooler than this with similar hardware is the Omen 15 AMD, so if temps are a priority may want to check that platform out. The Asus Tuf’s are as hot if not hotter, and the Dell G5 SE is a small portable sun. However, you do get something for this heat, the aforementioned Cinebench scores blow the competition out of the water, I still can’t believe it’s on par with my desktop processor.Final Thoughts:This thing runs warm, looks good (if you like the aesthetic), has a phenomenal spec sheet for the price, and has best in class screen for a non special-order low-mid budget prebuilt. Would recommend, with the one slight caveat regarding heat.\n', ""\n  This laptop is good, performance, design, screen and fast.However, something is wrong.First of all, I always check hard disk whenever I buy a laptop since I sometimes experienced receiving used laptop instead of new. It happened to this laptop. I check hard disk and it was turned on 208 times before.It might be program error but as far as I know, they are pretty accurate(crystal disk info) It looks new but might be not. Maybe I am unlucky. I will post another review later after I investigate more.update 1.So, My purchase date and warranty start date are different.Usually, warranty starts when I first install Windows and turn on laptop first time.This laptop had started warranty about more than 1 month ago, it doesn't any make sense to me.I talked about it with Amazon customer service and what they said is 'just return it',So disappointing so far.\n"", ""\n  Edit 2: have been using the laptop for few month. No issues at all. Love it. Will move it back to 4 stars..........Edit 1: I was so happy with this laptop and put an amazing review. After 10 days, this vertical line appeared and it's constant through all applications, even in Bios. Meaning this is a hardware defect. Will change my review to one star for poor quality control. I have returned the laptop and Amazon honored 30 day return window. The new units doesn't have this line. Will see if the same problems happens in the next few weeks.............................If you're not willing wait to RTX 3000. This laptop is the best bang for the buck. The build quality is good. Fan is quite and powerful. Love it.I've been using the laptop now for a week. It's much better than what I thought. Super quite when you need it be quite. Powerful when you need it to be powerful. I actually returned the Helios 300, which I bough for 999 as well on a deal. Helios 300 has RTX 2060 which is not so different from 1660 Ti (Don't let them fool you). .With helios noise at idle is just unbearable, Intel heat is ridiculous as well and the build quality doesn't come close Legion 5.  Legion 5 Beats it at all the way. .\n"", ""\n  I really like the new design. It looks like a workstation more than a gaming laptop!I'm gonna try and keep this short:PROS:- build quality is excellent,- specs are insane,- 2.5kg and the dimensions make it really portable,- screen is amazing! 144Hz and 300nits.- Ryzen 7 4800H...- GTX 1660ti is great for video editing and gaming!- laptop feels premium!CONS:- speakers are mediocre. Volume is decent but the sound quality is ok.-battery is really bad...less that 4 hours.- there is no international warranty (now this is Lenovo fault)!To be honest, this laptop is best buy at this price (999$). I'm really glad I bought it!Edit:There is a lot of problems with Linux...I actually thought Lenovo was the best with open source drivers and support for Linux...I was wrong.I can't run Linux, I can't have warranty in my own country, I can't have normal battery life. I guess I'll return it!Edit 2:I have random freezes. It just stops responding while doing random stuff. Returning it!\n"", ""\n  EDIT: 3 months in, I am noticing more problems. Not sure if it's the laptop or windows or drivers.- WIFI disconnects randomly. I get disconnected about 2-3 times a day now. Nothing has changed in my set up. I tried resetting the network in windows but didn't help.- Mouse lag, whenever some CPU or integrated graphics work is needed such as opening a video or rendering a game, the mouse lags for about 1 second. It's quite annoying that the cursor just stops moving and then jumps to the destination. When I disable integrated graphics (hybrid mode), it seems to be fine.- I got a blue screen a few days ago. Not sure what's going on. Again, nothing changed in my set up and I didn't install any new software.- Opening VLC player for the first time since I boot the computer takes especially long (like 5 seconds). Subsequent videos takes less than a second.--------------------------------------------------- Original Review -------------------------------------------------Bought this for $1310 CAD and it's amazing. ASUS TUF A15 with the same spec is priced at $1399 CAD and it has poor screen and thermal.Pros:- 144 Hz screen with good color, good response time. Max brightness is pretty bright on a white background but not a dark background- Thin screen bezel makes my laptop smaller than my older 15 inch laptop.- The screen can open 180 degree, not that I use it at all but it's nice to show it off- Web cam has a physical slide cover for good privacy. Little things like this just makes me love my laptop more.- Great hardware for the price- Amazingly powerful CPU. I was able to get 4.6k score with cinebench r20 on performance mode.- GPU is powerful enough for most games. It's more powerful than my GTX 1060-6GB on desktop- SSD is super fast, has an additional SSD or HDD slot which means you can add either a SSD or a HDD.- Build quality is great and solid. Looks very clean and pleasing.- Keyboard looks clean and cap lock buttons have lighting. Back light is very nice. The keys has a slight curve and it's pretty cool.- Fn key covers the most important functionalities like sound level and brightness- Fn+Q is just great for switching performance modes quickly- Speaker is quite loud- Thermal is great, when stressing the CPU, it only goes up to 85 C and never thermal throttle. It cools down very fast once the stress is over. Similarly for the GPU- In the lenovo vantage software, there is a conservation mode which will not charge your battery until it goes below 50% or something. It makes battery last longer if your laptop is plugged in most of the time.Cons:- Screen brightness doesn't seem linear. Most of the time I have to use light level 8+. The levels below 8 just seems too dim. Only the highest 3 levels are usable- Touch pad is not clickable anywhere. Top left and top right is not clickable. As you move up the touch pad, it gets harder to click down.- It was hard to pry open the bottom panel to install a second hard drive. The build quality is too good that it's hard to open.- The 2 USB ports are at the back and it's inconvenient. Most of the time when I plug in my USB, I plug it on the side. But 1 on each side is pretty nice. I would rather have 2 on each side than 2 on the back.- The numpad has small keys. Spacing between keys is a bit big and I need to get used to.- This model doesn't offer RGB keyboard backlight- The function key doesn't allow turning on/off WIFI or bluetooth. It also doesn't allow turning off the screen.- When volume is turned up, you can feel the vibration of the speaker under your hand- The body has some soft rubber covering and that might get sticky in the future- I noticed on balanced mode, the fan still runs with a bit of noise even when the CPU were always below 10%. I would be more happy if it runs quiet until the CPU gets warmer and increase the fan speed more. Basically a manual fan control would be perfect. The ultra quiet mode in the BIOS doesn't seem to work for me.- The SSD and WIFI card area can get quite warm and the fan doesn't really cool it.Will keep updating as I notice the little goods and bads during everyday use.\n"", '\n  Overall a great laptop. After looking around I found the compatible 80wh battery.Item number:L19C4PC1: with regular length connection cableL19M4PC1: with extended length connection cableThese 2 are fully compatible with this model, as long as you can  find one.\n', ""\n  Second Update: There really is nothing else in this range at this price.  Since the unit operated fine for the first few days at normal temps and benchmarking, re-ordered and will update this review once I've had some experience with the new unit.Update: Unit started overheating today, even idling it is up over 60 Celsius despite having tons of air flow from the bottom, keeps randomly shutting down as temperature spikes.  Tried updating firmware to no effect.  Returning as I'm still within first 30 days.Like the unit but sadly can't recommend it.Previous Review: Very good unit with 8 core processor and 1660ti.  Handles everything I can throw at it, although it can hit 90 Celsius under full load. Still better than everything else besides the HP Omen for temperatures.  Uses a Samsung SSD rather than the slower and more common SK Hynix SSD in most laptops.Also a very good programming laptop due to a ton of cores, compiling code goes very quickly.One star off do to Amazon shipping US units to Canada, which will likely create warranty issues if they crop up later on.  Warranty only shows 11 months left on Lenovo's own website.\n"", '\n  ACTUALIZACIÓN: Ya con 6 meses de uso quiero decir que estoy muy satisfecho con esta compra, cero problemas hasta el día de hoy, no he tenido problema de sobrecalentamiento pese a sesiones de rendering o de juegos de mas de 6 horas. Solo he tenido 2 BSOD en estos 6 meses y fueron por un bug en la función de Suspender. Le he agregado 2 TBs de SSD y 32 GBs de RAM sin ninguna complicación. Puedo recomendarla a ciegas a quien busque un gran balance precio/poder/portabilidad.Después de 1 semana de espera llego mi Legion 5, y estoy altamente satisfecho por la relación calidad/precio, aquí lo mas notable.LO BUENO:- Increíblemente poderosa en el área de CPU, Cinebench R20 da un valor de 4200 en modo normal, y 4500 en modo de alto desempeño.- El SSD es un Samsung PM981a, la versión OEM del 970 EVO, así que vuela, 3500 MB/s de lectura y 2950 MB/s de escritura.- Una pantalla muy superior a las disponibles en el mercado nacional, 144 Hertz, 99% de cobertura RGB y 300 nits de luminosidad.- El desempeño de la GeForce 1660 Ti aunque no rompe ningún record es muy bueno.- El diseño es muy utilitario para una laptop de juegos, nada de colores extravagantes, por lo que se puede usar como computadora de trabajo sin problema.- Se puede actualizar sin problema la RAM, el almacenamiento (hay un puerto vacio para un NVME adicional) y el WiFi.- El teclado es una gozada, en efecto no trae la letra ""Ñ"" pero se puede solucionar instalando ""Inglés - Internacional"" como la distribución del teclado en Windows, estará disponible con Alt+N.- La batería dura 5:24 horas una vez activado el modo híbrido acorde a PCMark, 3:30 horas en modo normal).- Poco bloatware, solo el molesto McAfee y Office 360.- La distribución de los puertos USB es muy buena.LO MALO:- No hay USB 3.1 Gen 2, todos los puertos están limitados a 5000 Mbps.- No carga por USB-C, aunque esto ya sería pedirle peras al olmo.- Es un poco difícil acceder al interior para actualizar los componentes.- La cámara es 720p.- No tiene lector de huellas ni Windows Hello.LO QUE HAY QUE SABER:- De fabrica viene configurada para siempre usar la tarjeta nVidia, lo que afecta severamente la bateria, si no vas a jugar siempre cámbiala a modo Híbrido.- El asunto de la garantía puede ser difícil debido a que es un producto importado, aunque usualmente Lenovo es confiable.- Incluye 1 mes de GamePass, solo tienes que iniciar sesión con tu cuenta de Outlook.- Consumo de energía 25w en YouTube 1080p, 90w cuando hay uso extensivo del CPU (110w en modo de Alto Desempeño), y 160-190w cuando se juega un titulo AAA.\n', '\n  I took a chance on Lenovo and I’m glad I did! This laptop is great for the price I paid ($1320 +tax CAD). It’s pretty thin for the specs and light as well.The IPS 144Hz screen is fantastic! I have a 144Hz TN Monitor and this laptop’s screen blows it away with the colour vibrancy. It’s not as fast as a TN panel but if you put the screen on Over Drive (from the Lenovo Vantage software), it comes very close.The keyboard is only in white backlight, but I feel like it adds a more refined look as opposed to an RGB lit keyboard. The keys have a nice satisfying feeling when you type on them as well as using it for playing games.As for the sound of the fans, it wasn’t too loud. Of course gaming laptops will have audible fans during full load but it didn’t really bother me. The CPU would reach 91C but then go back down to the low 70s and high 80s. It didn’t thermal throttle at all. As for the 1660 Ti, the hottest it got for me was 70C at about 2 hrs of gaming. Pretty good.And no I’m not an influencer. I bought this with my own money.\n']"

Is it a $700, $800 laptop? Absolutely not, but if you need a good laptop that CAN charge with USB-C PD, has good battery life (5-12hrs depending on how hard it\'s pushed and if it\'s using Linux or Windows), and a beautiful display, this is the computer for you. The quad core processor is actually a pretty decent little chip but while it beats out the Celeron N series chips in most budget laptops, it obviously doesn\'t hold a candle to a core i5 or Ryzen 3 laptop. If your use case doesn\'t require a lot of CPU or GPU, this is a fantastic laptop and nothing comes close to it in price.It is a pretty good Windows laptop and has no issues with anything except lots of Chrome tabs but Firefox works really well with the modest specs of this laptop. I installed Pop!_OS Linux after a few days and the difference was pretty impressive. Battery life went up by about 20-50% depending on the workload and CPU usage was also lower when idling or doing light tasks.The BIOS can be hard to find but pressing the delete or escape key on startup will put you in the menu and for those interested in installing Linux, you\'ll want to go to the south bridge (yes it has a south bridge) settings to change the OS it\'s looking for from Windows to Linux.The screen is obviously the star of the show here and it is truly amazing, especially in the 3:2 aspect ratio but I\'m going to focus on some other aspects that may be less clear. The top of the laptop, i.e. behind the display is aluminum and feels pretty sturdy but the rest of the body is made of plastic. I\'m usually not a fan of plastic but it\'s color matched well and feels almost as good as the aluminum while doing a better job of keeping the bits you touch from getting hot when the laptop is really working.The touchpad is plastic but it is definitely on the larger side, large enough that there is no room for a single complaint about it not being big enough. The first few days it feels a bit rough but after that the touchpad becomes quite smooth and nice to use so when you first try to use it and your finger bounces across the surface, don\'t worry it\'ll get better. The left and right click buttons are integrated under the touchpad so you press on the bottom of the touchpad and it\'ll click I\'d you don\'t like the one/two finger click style.The keyboard is also plastic and while it\'s not amazing, it feels like a $500-$600 laptop keyboard, not like a bottom of the barrel keyboard. A big part of what gives it that good feel is the tactility. It has a good amount of key travel, probably a bit more than average for a laptop and the keys don\'t feel totally mushy. They have a travel to them that allows you to feel when a key has been pressed, it\'s not totally linear as it has what I would describe as a miniscule drop at the bottom of the press that helps you feel when something is pressed. The keys can shift a little with sideways force but it\'s certainly not the worst I\'ve felt and definitely fine considering the $349.99 price point I purchased it at.The RAM and storage are well more than enough to get you off the ground and it even has an M.2 2280 extension bay that I have yet to test but I\'ll try to update the review when I do so I can confirm if it works with NVMe or just SATA M.2 drives. (I tried an NVMe 1TB WD Green 2280 and Linux was unable to recognize it in the computer though the slot technically fits an NVMe. Not sure if it would work with Windows.) Note: the built-in storage is a SATA-III SSD, not NVMe though I wouldn\'t expect it at this price and not the much slower eMMC storage many budget laptops unfortunately use. Also, I have yet to use more than 4.5GB RAM at a time so 12 is definitely overkill for this class of laptop (I did hit 6.2GB in Windows once).The speakers... This is where some of the high praises are no longer that high although with an asking price this low, corners have to be cut somewhere. The stereo speakers are far from awful however they border ""decent"" and ""alright"". They fire from holes on the bottom of the laptop and get muffled if it\'s on your lap. They do get recently loud and you can at least hear a tiny hint of bass so I\'ll give them that. The headphone jack reveals that headphone listening is actually pretty good. I am an audiophile with decent but not crazy hardware and the on board dac does well enough that I don\'t have any complaints though the audio gets a bit thin in the higher frequencies. The high notes don\'t sound bad, there\'s just a noticeable lack of some detail. I\'ve heard audio from PC motherboards over half the price of this laptop that sound a good bit worse than what the audio jack on this laptop has to offer though so 9/10 there, great job Chuwi!The fan on this laptop (it does have one) maxes out at 26-27 or so DBA which means a lightly whispered conversation will drown out the fans at full speed. I\'ve only seen the fans kick on two times and both times, I was hammering the CPU and GPU at the same time for hours on end so while it technically has a fan, it\'s super quiet, so quiet it\'s basically fanless. At full tilt for hours on end the chassis right under the fan gets warm enough to be noticeable but the rest of the laptop stays impressively cool to the touch. I use my laptop on the go very often and it never gets warm enough to notice even when on my lap for long periods of time and that is a huge plus in my book.The webcam is an 0.3MP unit so everything looks super soft and really, really bad. Like 2012 budget Android phone bad. This is NOT for video calls, this will look absolutely atrocious on any video calling platform. PLEASE do not use this for Zoom! Get a USB webcam. The camera is only there to tick the box on the spec sheet.The hinge: I had actually heard some conflicting things about the build of the hinge when researching this laptop so I\'ll try to clear things up a bit. The long, centered hinge is also made of plastic by the way and while it\'s not super sturdy, it doesn\'t feel like it\'ll break too easily. That said I would still open and close it at a reasonable speed and not slam it shut because obviously it is still a budget laptop but overall it\'s a good hinge.And that\'s all I got! Hopefully this review was of some help to you and if so, please hit the ""Helpful"" button. I\'ll continue to update this review as I use the laptop more. This review is currently based on 1 month of ownership.\n', '\n  Absolutely the best screen on any laptop even close to this price range (it uses the same panel as the Huawei Matebook 13 which literally costs 3 times as much). I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the rest of the laptop as well, sturdy aluminum/plastic shell, a very useable keyboard, and a decent webcam with optimal placement at the top of the screen. The storage and RAM are excellently sized for the price as well. The processor is not very powerful for a modern machine but definitely snappy enough for web browsing and word processing; it is MILES better than the Celeron N3350 in my old netbook which originally retailed for the same $350 price tag.One issue with the laptop and I notice a few questions about it above - the laptop comes with Windows 10 but it it does NOT come with a valid activation key - see pictures. It seems that as a cost-cutting measure, CHUWI is using the same Windows key on many different laptop installations, which invalidates the activation.You will still be able to use Windows as normal except for some personalization options, such as setting your own desktop wallpaper. There will also constantly be an ""Activate Windows"" watermark in the bottom right corner of your screen which can be mildly annoying. I am willing to live with it but I wish CHUWI was more forthcoming about this drawback to an otherwise fantastic budget laptop.\n', '\n  Recently bought this laptop for my 10 year old to do online school. What a waste of money! Computer has so many issues from the second it was turned on. The audio and video went in and out. Don’t even waste ur time using zoom with this cuz u won’t be able to hear anyone and the camera is so dark on ur end making it very difficult for anyone to see you. For how big the ram is, the computer runs extremely slow and lags a lot. I was not impressed at all and ended up returning this laptop the first day I got it. Do not waste ur money on this one!\n', '\n  TRASH. Didn\'t last a month before the screen went. There were light spots along the bottom of the screen from day one which was a red flag.

I feel compelled to offer you a review of this product because of how much praise I believe it presently deserves. It is seriously, without a doubt, one of the best laptops I have ever had the privilege of owning. I am also a computer technician by trade, so I wouldn\'t throw around such confident statements unless I truly meant them!Let\'s break things down to some finer points now...MAJOR PROS:- Overall processor speed. The Ryzen 7 4800H chip is the bee\'s knees! It handles, with absolute ease, literally everything I throw at it. It also tops out at 4.292GHz, not 4.2. Then, under medium-sustained loads it holds anywhere between 3.3GHz and 3.6GHz boost ON ALL THREADS. Of course, after thermal throttling sets in (a great while later and with a high GPU load to really boggle it down, as the two share heatpipes) it levels out to anywhere between 2.2GHz and 2.8GHz (again, on all threads). But that\'s only under super-heavy-benchmark loads. Basically overkill to the average user who will likely never stress it down that much for that long. Nevertheless, at 8C/16T these speeds are hard to beat in today\'s day and age (for the mid-range laptop CPU class that is). Translation: whether you\'re a gamer, a student, or a working professional, you won\'t be disappointed in the least!- GeForce RTX 2060. In a laptop? With an 8C/16T processor? Sold! I can\'t find a AAA game that it doesn\'t quickly devour at 60-100 FPS on ""ultra"" settings. I believe the stock AMD variant of this GPU comes overclocked by default, as I am seeing 1005MHz base / 1350MHz boost in GPU-Z rather than the standard 960MHz base / 1200MHz boost. (Then, on top of that, I was able to safely *even further* overclock it with MSI Afterburner by an additional +125MHz core / +500MHz mem, which is just dandy!). Of course, overall cooling between the GPU and CPU remains adequate and consistent, as I have not experienced any overheating / shutting down / erratic frame drop / etc. issues whatsoever to date (even though the fans do get somewhat loud at times).- Two NVMe M.2 slots. I stuck a 500GB 970 EVO Plus in as my OS drive, while repurposing the 1TB Intel 660p as my data drive. Easy peasy upgrade using standard cloning software (I used Macrium Reflect). Also, I was able to leave the Intel drive in the ""primary"" M.2 slot (the one right next to the GPU heatpipe) which allowed me to put the EVO Plus drive in the ""secondary"" M.2 slot (even though it\'s now the OS drive) -- all so as to allow me to keep its temps down lower (like by an additional 10-20C that is) when compared to having it hang out over by the heatpipe! Basically, the BIOS doesn\'t care which SSD is physically located in which M.2 slot, which is just awesome IMHO. In fact, to those of you who won\'t be adding a secondary SSD for awhile -- go move that Intel 660p over anyways so that you can save yourself some degrees regardless! Doing so won\'t hurt a bit / will only help extend the life of your drive.- DisplayPort over USB 3.2 Gen 2. THE reason I upgraded to this laptop from a previous gen one. Paired with a decent 240Hz ASUS VG279QM monitor, I have yet to experience a single display issue WHATSOEVER. Everything works just perfectly. Drivers work perfectly. G-Sync works perfectly. I literally couldn\'t be more pleased with my setup. Also, if anybody wants (much) more finite control over their NVIDIA Control Panel settings, go find and download NVIDIA Profile Inspector. You\'ll be pleasantly surprised at what you can tweak with it! Also checkout Blurbusters.com for tutorials on how to setup your G-Sync, V-Sync, and FPS cap settings. (So you know, I have G-Sync on at all times, V-Sync on at all times, and a FPS cap set at 3 less than my monitor\'s refresh rate).- 144Hz screen. On this topic, I see everybody and their mother being overly-picky, bashing the screen in this laptop as if it\'s complete trash. Honestly, for 90% of the regular users out there / a good amount of gamers, the technological advancements of 144Hz screens over yester-generation\'s 60Hz screens is simply astounding, and absolutely nothing to complain about. I am personally quite impressed with the screen. Anything nicer and you\'re (appropriately) looking at the next price-point up, like the G15 or something. So give this screen a break! It\'s bright enough, sharp enough, and fast enough to satisfy the typical ""mid-range"" gaming class of laptops that it was specifically manufactured to be used in. Yes, it doesn\'t have the best grey-to-grey response time on the market, but unless you\'re an absolute professional gamer who has a long history of playing at lower response times, you\'d be hard pressed to tell the difference (if at all, seriously). Same goes for color gamut. It\'s not like the screen is so ""washed out"" that you\'re looking at a freaking monochrome display! For the majority of regular users / gamers out there, the vibrancy is *more* than sufficient (and can be turned up in the display settings, to help a little there, for that\'s what I do to compensate and I\'m quite happy with the results). More importantly, in my opinion, is that the display pushes 144Hz. Compared to 60Hz, the difference is LITERALLY NIGHT AND DAY. I kid you not. And just as important (if not more than) is the fact that it utilizes FreeSync, a technology identical to G-Sync that completely eliminates screen tearing (something I can\'t stand far more than anything else when gaming). I swear, once you go ""variable refresh rate"" there\'s no going back! Absolutely nothing beats the buttery-smooth experience it provides when enabled. (Like seriously, if you haven\'t gamed with it before, you are in for a real treat!) NOW FOR SOME SIDE NOTES: Regarding brightness, there\'s a feature buried in the AMD Radeon Settings app -- called ""Vari-Bright"" -- that evidently ships enabled by default, and to which disabling should somewhat improve the brightness of your screen (and especially so when viewing it outdoors). ALSO: Regarding ghosting, make sure that ""motion blur"" is disabled in your games (if the setting exists) as doing so should somewhat improve the sharpness of your screen / help mitigate the negative effects of its higher response time (again, if you even notice it in the first place).- 90Wh battery. Simply put, this is unheard of in a gaming laptop with these specs. Thank goodness for M.2 slots (so we can finally get rid of those pesky 2.5"" drive bays!). Also, if anybody is interested, go download HWInfo64 so you can see precisely how fast your laptop is discharging, by the watt. You may find that certain apps / tasks / etc. artificially drain your battery faster than others.- Third USB port (on the right). I never thought I would need this port so much, but lo and behold, it has become quite the invaluable addition to my setup. Now I can have one USB 3 hub connected to one port, one USB 2 hub connected to another, and one USB 3 port left free for dedicated external drive support (as they often work better/faster when connected directly and not through any hubs). At last, my desktop replacement is complete!- Aluminum lid. Very robust. Doesn\'t collect fingerprints easily. Not as silverish in the dark as I thought it would be (which is a good thing, as I wanted something closer to black anyways).- Dedicated L/R mouse buttons. Having dedicated touchpad buttons is a major improvement over the previous gen configuration, IMO. I couldn\'t stand the previous gen\'s ""all-in-one"" trackpad.- Keyboard. A little bit more tactile / more responsive than their previous gen keyboard. Of course, I\'m not a fan of such tiny UDLR buttons this time around, but laptop manufacturers are probably never going to settle on where to put those guys!- Internal speakers. I\'m surprised at how much punch they pack! When compared to their previous gen speakers, they are indeed a little bit louder, while also offering a little bit wider audible range (bass especially).- Flawless hardware/software compatibility. I haven\'t had A SINGLE freeze up, BSOD, driver issue, etc. to date. This is definitely one of the most important requirements for me as computer technician. Honestly, good job ASUS for building such a rock solid machine! SIDE NOTE: I did experience one issue, where after manually updating the AMD chipset drivers directly from their website, I began experiencing awful external mouse stuttering issues when connected to an external display. I\'m not surprised, however, that this happened, because of how most drivers (with the exception of NVIDIA GeForce drivers as I have historically experienced) are better left up to the OEM to have updated, so as to ensure that they are properly vetted by them. As in, most drivers should be left alone by the typical end user, unless they happen to see an update become available directly on their laptop manufacturer\'s support site for their particular model of device. So ultimately, there is nothing *wrong* here, as the chipset drivers I attempted to install weren\'t actually ASUS approved ones. I mean, if everything works as it should ""out of the box"" (which it undoubtedly does with this particular model) than there\'s really no need to seek out driver updates anyways, let alone external ones not found on the laptop\'s support site. I\'m just a hobbyist of sorts, I guess? But as the famous saying still goes: ""if it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it!"" Needless to say, after rolling back the chipset drivers (to stock) everything was back to normal again.- Minimal bloatware. Just had to uninstall McAfee and a few windows store apps, and that was pretty much it.MINOR CONS:- Highish CPU temp under load. Strictly speaking, it isn\'t technically ""high"" so much as it is ""higher than I am personally comfortable with seeing."" I mean, based on my tests, it is clear that ASUS/AMD explicitly set the max temp for this CPU to top out at exactly 95.0C before thermal throttling consistently kicks in (and fans go up / clocks go down). So, just to be clear, BY DESIGN, the CPU in this laptop is evidently meant to hold 95C perpetually. In fact, during thorough benchmarking, I never ONCE saw it go above 95.0C, or my computer shut down, or anything like that. So it is somewhat reassuring that my system is supposedly working *as it should.* I guess I just get nervous, in general, anytime I see anything above 90C in a laptop. Fortunately (and for anybody else out there interested in dropping their CPU temps down significantly) I found a neat trick online that involves setting the ""Maximum Processor State"" to 99% in Control Panel > Power Plan Settings, and to which doing so has perpetually lowered my peak CPU temp down by 10-20C under sustained load! Of course, this trick only works at lowering temps because it effectively disables turbo boost, as well as lock all base clocks to a measly 1.7GHz on all threads. But after extensive testing, doing so only drops the average FPS in my games by 10-30% or so, which for me is an acceptable trade-off for what I get in return! (BTW, I believe ASUS does something similar with ""Silent"" mode in their Armoury Crate app, though from my testing it appears that my 99% trick isn\'t as crippling to system responsiveness as their Silent profile is). Also, I should note, when performing this 99% trick, my overall laptop\'s fan noise is much quieter, albeit not absent from the system entirely.- 802.11AC wireless adapter. It would have been nice to see the new AX standard here. But then again, it only set me back a whopping $25 to upgrade the adapter to a nice Intel AX200 one (and to which I have not experienced any compatibility issues with, either).Boy, other than that, I honestly can\'t think of any other cons worth mentioning. This series is in its fourth generation for crying out loud (from the 503 days). Almost every kink possible has been worked out. These are seriously WELL OILED MACHINES at this point.MY FINAL WORD: If/when you get the chance, don\'t pass up the opportunity to own one these babies!EDIT: For the longest time, I was pretty bummed that mobile Ryzen chips were not tweakable using AMD\'s famous Ryzen Master utility. But fortunately, I have recently come across ""Ryzen Controller"" -- a third party utility that is almost just as good! After playing around with it, I have managed to cap my CPU\'s TDP at pretty much any value I want, and to which in turn (coupled with an easy undervolt of my GPU using MSI Afterburner) has allowed me to keep my temps at pretty much anywhere I want -- all depending on how many FPS I feel like seeing! With detail being the constant, think 75C on both the CPU and GPU w/ an average FPS of 110, for example, or say, 85C on the CPU and 80C on the GPU w/ an average FPS of 120, or perhaps 90C on the CPU and 85C on the GPU w/ an average FPS of 130. (All this compared to stock being at 95C on the CPU and 86C on the GPU w/ an average FPS of 125, btw.) Basically, the ""99% trick"" explained above is a great place to start for beginner tweakers, but to which the clock speeds get artificially capped at a lowly 1.7GHz, while finely tuning one\'s system with Ryzen Controller allows for much more advanced tweaking, but to which still allows regular turbo boost to continue on all threads (at a frequency capped only in relation to how much TDP you decide to throttle it with). THE FINAL RESULT: I have been able to boost my FPS farther (even past stock!) and keep my CPU temps and fan noise down lower (much lower!) with Ryzen Controller, than with the 99% trick. Hope this helps, and happy computing!SECOND EDIT: A commenter of my review suggested a better way to disable turbo boost on the CPU while not dropping its base clock as much / if at all. Indeed, the new trick does provide a higher base clock! Unfortunately, however, I found that it didn\'t do much to lower my peak CPU temp in certain games, which still hovered at around 95C during gameplay. I think I might still have a few uses for the new trick, though, as I\'m sure I\'ll find some games that do benefit from it. But ultimately, until then, nothing has been able to beat the results I have obtained by way of manually capping my CPU\'s TDP using Ryzen Controller. Thank you nonetheless for the sweet tip, my dude! Excellent find indeed, and a formidable replacement to the 99% trick where base clocks are of primary concern.UPDATE: As just mentioned, the RC app yielded me better control over CPU temps, in certain games, than what the turbo-boost-disabling trick was able to accomplish. However, in other games it appears to be a wash. Let me share a particular benchmarking analysis with you, so you can see precisely what I mean! This is the DiRT Rally benchmark, with most detail set to ultra, 4X anti-aliasing, and ""Performance"" mode set in Armoury Crate (as I prefer the lower fan noise over what ""Turbo"" mode provides):- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -STOCK EVERYTHING =AVG CPU / GPU TEMP: 95.0C / 86.0CAVG / MIN / MAX FPS: 125.40 / 98.28 / 156.58MAX CPU CLK: 4292 MHzAVG GPU CLK: 1319 MHz @ 0.709 VAVG CPU / GPU PWR: 19.1 W / 67.2 W- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -STOCK CPU + GPU UV/OC =AVG CPU / GPU TEMP: 95.0 / 86.0AVG / MIN / MAX FPS: 128.17 / 96.86 / 167.45MAX CPU CLK: 4292 MHzAVG GPU CLK: 1500 MHz @ 0.700 VAVG CPU / GPU PWR: 20.9 W / 64.7 W- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -99% TRICK =AVG CPU / GPU TEMP: 83.2 / 86.0AVG / MIN / MAX FPS: 80.65 / 53.16 / 110.96MAX CPU CLK: 1700 MHzAVG GPU CLK: 1634 MHz @ 0.849 VAVG CPU / GPU PWR: 10.6 W / 74.4 W- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -99% TRICK + GPU UV/OC =AVG CPU / GPU TEMP: 75.9 / 74.2AVG / MIN / MAX FPS: 79.45 / 52.58 / 105.39MAX CPU CLK: 1700 MHzAVG GPU CLK: 1500 MHz @ 0.700 VAVG CPU / GPU PWR: 10.0 W / 50.1 W- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -TB DISABLED =AVG CPU / GPU TEMP: 88.7 / 84.6AVG / MIN / MAX FPS: 118.43 / 83.47 / 162.66MAX CPU CLK: 2890 MHzAVG GPU CLK: 1413 MHz @ 0.739 VAVG CPU / GPU PWR: 15.1 W / 69.7 W- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -TB DISABLED + GPU UV/OC =AVG CPU / GPU TEMP: 84.4 / 80.5AVG / MIN / MAX FPS: 125.33 / 84.48 / 168.51MAX CPU CLK: 2890 MHzAVG GPU CLK: 1500 MHz @ 0.700 VAVG CPU / GPU PWR: 14.9 W / 64.8 W- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -RC TDP @ 8W =AVG CPU / GPU TEMP: 87.8 / 84.7AVG / MIN / MAX FPS: 116.42 / 90.18 / 150.84MAX CPU CLK: 4292 MHzAVG GPU CLK: 1421 MHz @ 0.744 VAVG CPU / GPU PWR: 14.3 W / 70.7 W- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -RC TDP @ 8W + GPU UV/OC =AVG CPU / GPU TEMP: 84.5 / 80.5AVG / MIN / MAX FPS: 121.01 / 93.26 / 149.23MAX CPU CLK: 4292 MHzAVG GPU CLK: 1500 MHz @ 0.700 VAVG CPU / GPU PWR: 14.6 W / 65.9 W- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -RC TDP @ 9W =AVG CPU / GPU TEMP: 91.2 / 85.8AVG / MIN / MAX FPS: 118.12 / 91.03 / 155.67MAX CPU CLK: 4292 MHzAVG GPU CLK: 1233 MHz @ 0.681 VAVG CPU / GPU PWR: 15.6 W / 60.1 W- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -RC TDP @ 9W + GPU UV/OC =AVG CPU / GPU TEMP: 85.7 / 80.9AVG / MIN / MAX FPS: 126.20 / 96.98 / 163.15MAX CPU CLK: 4292 MHzAVG GPU CLK: 1500 MHz @ 0.700 VAVG CPU / GPU PWR: 15.8 W / 66.0 W- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -RC TDP @ 11W + GPU UV/OC =AVG CPU / GPU TEMP: 90.0 / 81.7AVG / MIN / MAX FPS: 129.47 / 81.51 / 166.97MAX CPU CLK: 4292 MHzAVG GPU CLK: 1500 MHz @ 0.700 VAVG CPU / GPU PWR: 18.6 W / 65.8 W- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -RC TDP @ 6W + GPU UV/OC =AVG CPU / GPU TEMP: 78.2 / 76.3AVG / MIN / MAX FPS: 110.62 / 82.08 / 138.84MAX CPU CLK: 4292 MHzAVG GPU CLK: 1500 MHz @ 0.700 VAVG CPU / GPU PWR: 12.0 W / 65.3 W- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -RC TDP @ 5W + GPU UV/OC =AVG CPU / GPU TEMP: 75.7 / 74.2AVG / MIN / MAX FPS: 101.30 / 77.67 / 133.44MAX CPU CLK: 4292 MHzAVG GPU CLK: 1500 MHz @ 0.700 VAVG CPU / GPU PWR: 10.9 W / 62.6 WCONCLUSION: If you\'re looking for a quick and dirty, set-it-and-forget-it mod, it appears that disabling turbo boost while simultaneously undervolting+overclocking the GPU can indeed yield you some pretty great temps -- in some games -- while leaving your FPS on par w/ stock no less! THEN, if you want complete control (regardless of the game) you can always squeeze out a little more FPS (or a little less on temps) by using Ryzen Controller, albeit thus requiring a little trial and error along the way to find the ideal TDP value. Basically, one method (the turbo-boost-disabling method) keeps CPU temps down by capping boost clocks, while the other method (the RC method) keeps CPU temps down by capping chip TDP. The two work in similar ways -- but differently -- and as such, it appears that each may have their own respective benefits depending on which game you play / what your goal is / how granular you are willing to go with your tweaking. As in, the RC method works better for me when playing NFS, because it does a better job at preventing me from going past 90C, while the turbo-boost-disabling method works better for me when playing DiRT, as that game doesn\'t seem to push me past 85C anyways, and the RC method didn\'t yield much better results in the alternative. NOW OF COURSE, if you\'re into squeezing as many FPS out of your machine for as little power spent / fan noise as possible (like gaming on battery for instance) nothing beats the RC method, hands down. Not the 99% trick, not the turbo-boost-disabling trick, and certainly not the Silent Mode profile in Armoury Crate for that matter, either (as that setting is easily the most crippling of the three). I mean, to see 78C/76C on the CPU/GPU, w/ 110 FPS on average, all while using only 12W/65W of CPU/GPU power? THAT\'S PRICELESS! Ultimately though, it should be noted here that the real mod making these CPU mods worth doing (any one of them) is the GPU undervolting+overclocking mod using MSI Afterburner. For without it, CPU temps just aren\'t as capable of being dropped so easily (because of how the two share heatpipes, remember). So make sure to mod that GPU of yours!\n', '\n  This laptop is seriously the best gaming experience, with a monitor included (obviously, it’s a laptop) that you’re going to find for $999 right now. That being said I will get into the pros and cons.Pros:Obviously the CPU. This thing is packing serious power, that being said this is a very hot CPU. I’m seeing average temps of about 86-95 degrees and it pretty much doesn’t ever go under that during gaming. This is to be expected with a gaming laptop but don’t expect it to run cooler than the intel solutions in this class.Gtx 1660ti that is on par with the 2019 Helios 300.

Will be a great gamer at 1080p for the near future.Best gaming setup for $999 you’ll find brand new to date.CONS:The one and only con I can really come up with is the display. It is absolutely atrocious. It does it’s job, but pretty much any other display would have looked better. Colors are obviously dull and washed out, don’t be expecting to do any photo editing or anything like that with this one.In addition the fan profiles are locked and there is no manual control over the curves. I feel they are slow to ramp up with the load on the CPU causing it to spike higher than it would if the fans stayed at a fixed speed for a while after the work load reduces, this causes a lot of fluctuation during gaming, and a overall very unpleasant noise level. Get a headset if you don’t have one.Benchmark results, benched with turbo mode on.

IT HASNT EVEN HEATED UP!!! AMAZING BUY THIS NOW\n', '\n  OKAY! So I have had this laptop for several months now. At first everything was awesome then I had issues with the battery not charging all the way up to 100%. I was very unhappy because that can mean a damaged cell. After doing some research I found that ASUS recommends draining the battery to about 50% a couple times a week and allowing it to recharge, this keeps the battery refreshing the cells appropriately. THIS SOLVED THE ISSUE, so after doing so I have had no problems.\n', '\n  this laptop is good it can play all my favorite games as you can see on the pictures its good for light gaming you can play gtav fallout 4 wow classic cities skylines fortnight cod mw to as well i have not issues with it at all. you can also upgrade your laptop ram and your hdd and it has 1 more pci ssd slot to as well.\n', '\n  This laptop is great value, and for about 30 bucks or less you can find an extra 8gb stick of ram on amazon to put into the laptop. This would give you 16gb of dual channel ram. The other great feature is this laptop has space for an extra ssd. Some versions (mine did not) have a extra m.2 slot as well as the ssd drive space! This amount of upgradability is wonderful.There is no touch screen which is fine as I do not want to whipe my fingers on my monitor anyway. The screen being 144hz is awesome and looks fantastic.The processor when rendering video or gaming can get to 80 C at peak load, you can easily fix this by getting a cooling fan pad for under the laptop and setting the power and fan settings to silent under the armory crate which comes installed on the computer. I now rarely hit super high temps.The only real complaint is the high processor temps which when compared with my other laptop which was a 2018 MacBook pro, those temps are actually cooler as my previous laptop would get so hot on the underside it would burn me, which this computer always at least physically seems cool.I would recommend this laptop for anyone who wants something that can be used to edit videos, for school, or light gaming. It runs stuff like overwatch, league, and valorant well. It also runs every indie game that I have played on it very well. I would recommend it to anyone who wants what is basically a portable version of an entry-level gaming pc.Oh, the light-up keyboard is cool too.Also when using Bluetooth the wifi may have issues due to the wifi chip they used in this laptop, this issue fixed itself after some windows updates and new drivers from myAsus. So any mentions of that issue in other reviews can be disregarded as simple software updates fixed this issue.Over all, 5/5 for the price and being able to be upgraded out of the box so easily!\n', '\n  This laptop is fantastic, don\'t bother with the nonsense on YouTube, only DigitalFoundry was correct ! The processor is tuned very well and it does hit high temps when boosting, but that happens to all Ryzen, it\'s the higher vcore needed for the boost and this laptop does expel the heat efficiently when the clocks drop. I would advise anyone using this laptop to go into the power plan and change the settings to the attached pic, while noting that 99% will cut power by a lot!What is being ignored by the  most it seems is the quality of the audio, it\'s very good for a Windows machine! The 144 hz screen is very good, it isn\'t color accurate but it\'s a gaming laptop!!!  If you want a great value ""gaming"" laptop then this is it!UPDATE: Bios 313 brings a lot of bug fixes. This new bios seems to do the same thing that the new Ryzen 5000 compatibility update has done for Ryzen 3000 on the B450 boards, more stable boost clocks and vcore probably via the new Agesa. Well worth the update!\n', '\n  Ive had this laptop for about 2 weeks now. When I bought it I was looking for something that can comfortably run a couple games, but nothing crazy.I have a couple games downloaded  like skyrim, Witcher 3, and Assassins Creed Oddessy(so open world adventure games), and have been using it for browsing/work. No issues. Laptop has been smooth, can run high graphics and although storage is low for me at 512GB, got an external hard drive thats doing the trick. Havent downloaded any mods yet but given its performance so far I think itll be fine. Overall, I’m very happy with this purchase.\n', '\n  The product material is not clear.

Sin embargo, es una excelente compra, el desempeño del equipo es fantástico.\n', '\n  Me encantó el diseño además que es muy rápida, para juegos la uso ocasionalmente y va bien, lo único que no me gustó fue que la duración de batería no es la mejor, apenas y 3 horas de uso, sin embargo se entiende al ser un equipo gamer.\n', '\n  Muy buena para le precio, corre muy bien todos los programas y no se calienta como mencionan algunos reviews, a menos que tengas la maquina corriendo a tope durante un buen tiempo, la he tenido prendida todo el dia (mas de 12 horas) y sigue estando muy bien con un uso normal entre clases, trabajo, videos y juegos.Un observación seria que ya esta por salir la nueva generación de procesador AMD serie 5000 la cual pinta bien, así que si no urge recomiendo esperar para tener la ultima actualización en el equipo (yo la compre antes del anuncio de los nuevos procesadores)Como adicional pueden necesitar agregar un poco mas de memoria (2TB HDD o 1TB SSD) ya que con algunos juegos, ni siquiera toda la librería los 500gb de SSD no duran nada, no son muy caras pero es un punto a considerar, depende la necesidad de cada quien.La pantalla baila mucho no se siente fija al cuerpo del equipo y es muy flexible asi que hay que tener cuidado de no tratarla rudo como otros equipos (tengo una Dell de trabajo y es mas robusta) también le falta un poco mas brillo pero si tienes un monitor como primario pues ya no debería ser un inconveniente. Como plus el equipo es un poco mas reducido en tamaño que otro que tengo de las mismas pulgadas por que el marco de la pantalla es muy delgado lo que me parece bueno para la portabilidad y bajo peso.En lo general la relación costo beneficio la considero muy buena y cumple con mis necesidades que seria mas de trabajo y gaming ocasional, si buscas un equipo para gaming exclusivo pues no recomendaría ningún equipo portátil sino una PC de escritorio.Siempre revisa que el vendedor y envio venga de Amazon a mi me llego la caja interna abierta, no la del embalaje pero supongo que fue por revisión ya que como tiene bateria trae sticker de riesgo, no faltaba nada adentro venia intacto pero puede generar desconfianza y en caso de cualquier problema es mas sencillo el proceso de devolución.\n', '\n  \xa0El precio es bueno,  me acaba de llegar, seguire viendo sino tiene algun defecto\n']"

Upon entering my info I noticed that the D key was not working. I put in a call to Acer tech support and have to send the laptop in to get repaired... the brand new out of the box product. Now I have to repackage everything, wait for a shipping label, drop it off and wait 7-10 business days (fancy wording for two weeks) instead of working on projects that I bought the laptop for. So at this point I am very disappointed in Acer’s quality control.I can’t really review the laptop itself since it was defective from the start.

It’s a great laptop for gamers who are just starting and it definitely will do the job. Has quite a nice bright screen. It is bulky overall but not as much as you’d think. I could probably still easily put it in my backpack to take to class. The keyboard is naturally red which could be a negative for some people but you can change the brightness of the backlit keyboard which I did love. One of the coolest things is that for a lap top the ram and SSD are pretty easily upgradable so with another stick of RAM and more storage youre looking at a pretty good quality laptop here that can play you most games you probably need and good for office work at the same time. My only personal con for this lap top is that as a right handed player they put all the important things for gaming on the right side (charing port, headphone jack, and USB for the mouse), so if you need to have them in all at the same time can be quite annoying to deal with in terms of cable management. It doesn’t really have any features that are too cool or special but it has an application called NitroSense used to check the speeds that your fans are going. On that application you can change it to high performance or max fan power if the game you are playing requires it. Personally I thought it was worth every dollar especially as a place to start if you’re kinda of behind and are on a budget like me.\n', '\n  I love this laptop beause it is low priced with very advanved hardware and also has a sleek look to it, I can play games at 100+ fps consistently and also allows mr to take care of my work/daily needs, overrall this comeupter is fulfilling what I wanted it tto do and more I would reccoemnd buying this if looking for a Low Priced but high capacity laptop.\n', ""\n  Parents bought this for my sister and this is perfect for her to start on it's good for light-medium gaming. With school converting to online it's perfect as well. This computer also has good battery life away from the charger while might use with heavy use not so much it's good though. Overall the computer is good for it's current price and an amazing deal.\n"", '\n  Absolutely amazing laptop!  Runs games with zero lag.  I was lucky to get it for $579, and would recommend checking this frequently as it goes super fast at that price.\n', '\n  Great laptop. Very smooth and easy to use. I bought this laptop with the intent to use for school and moderate gaming, and does quite the job. Graphics are so clean!!! The build feels really great and the quality is amazing for what you pay for. The sleek look and design, along with the light up keyboard makes it look so aggressive and gives you a ""gamer"" type feel when using.\n', ""\n  A very good laptop for a very affordable price.For $850 you can't get a better gaming laptop. The performance of this laptop from the games I've played has really surprised me. In Rainbow Six Siege I'm getting 100 or so FPS on the highest settings, meanwhile newer AAA games like AC: Odyssey get 45-60 on high settings.However I would strongly recommend spending another $100 and getting another 8gb of RAM and 1tb of storage as this laptop doesn't come with much space and upgrading the RAM increases the performance on newer games. It was really easy to upgrade both the storage and RAM I used a video guide for reference and had no problems.The laptop does get loud when under heavy load but I barely notice the fans when I have a headset and when the laptop is idle it's very faint. The Nitro 5 can also get quite warm sometimes but It's not much of a problem if you have a cool room.I tested the battery life and got around 6-7 hours using battery saver mode the whole time. But if you try to game while on battery you'll be lucky to get 2.Overall not much to complain about, all I recommend is you buy another 8gb of RAM and some more storage abd you're good to go.\n"", '\n  I could go on forever about how awful this laptop is. But the bottom line is that IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY PLAY GAMES YOU NEED STORAGE. THIS LAPTOP HAS NONE. NONE. And the reason I say none is because I seriously could only download 1 game. That’s it. That’s all. 1 game. Doesn’t run great, nothing special at all. If you’re going to blow this much money DO NOT WASTE IT ON THIS. You could buy a non gaming laptop for waaaay cheaper that would even run better than this and you could download most likely all the games you want with no issues.....please PLEASE take my advice and don’t buy this laptop ITS NOT WORTH IT!!\n', '\n  Una computadora muy completa, hermosa en su diseño, viene muy bien protegida, llegó súper rápido, es toda una experiencia el abrirla y tenerla en tus manos, muy rápida, materiales de excelente calidad, una pantalla increíble y el teclado ni se diga, te recomiendo comprarla y además trae un regalo extra 🙌🏻 Excelente computadora relación calidad/precio incluso se pasa de calidad, muy bien, la recomiendo ampliamente 👏🏻 Acer hizo muy buen trabajo con una computadora así, tiene todo y más de lo que esperas y no le pide nada a otras computadoras gamer, increíble definitivamente 👌🏻❤️\n', '\n  Nunca antes tuve un equipo de la marca Acer ya que siempre tuve mis dudas respecto a su calidad.

The laptop's speaker quality is very mediocre. Granted, the laptop audio quality is stellar. When plugged into headphones or other speakers, it sounds great. I just wish the speakers on the laptop gave a better quality sound. Nonetheless, it's worth it.\n"", ""\n  So right out of the box, this laptop is very sturdy and well made! It feels like a black aluminum casing. The fans have been pretty quiet thus far. Running Final Fantasy 14 on max graphics in an over populated zone and it is holding up extremely well! Even the MSI Dragon software works pretty well for monitoring the Laptop's performance! Super happy with this purchase so far! Can't wait to really put it to the test!\n"", ""\n  when you want to buy a laptop i have the one for you, it's not that expensive and it's amazing. You'll have everything you need in this laptop. Pros: It's the best, Cons: There's no cons.BUY IT IF YOU CAN.\n"", ""\n  Now let's face it. It's an RTX 2070 unit at sub 2k SGD. Powerful i7-10750h, gorgeous 1080p 144hz panel, decent weight, and has pretty good cooling. What else can you ask for?Only thing is that the design screams gamer with the MSI badge and the 2 accentuated lines at the back. But if you're not specifically looking for Stealth Models like the GS66 or something like the Razer Blade Stealth, this does it.Only had 1 issue upon arrival with the internal cable for the monitor needing to be repaired. But sent it in to an MSI service centre here in Singapore and got it fixed in 3 days.Can't wait to put this machine to the test. Best purchase in the last 3 years.\n"", ""\n  Overall has a good price/quality balance. The 144hz screen is amazing and the RGB keyboard works well, with a different key texture that could take a while for you to be familiar with. The design is not the thinnest or fanciest but the laptop is not ugly eitherPositive points: Not too heavy for a RTX2070 laptop gaming; good screen with tiny bezels; very comfortable keyboard base with nice touch; overall build quality is fine for this price range, though the difference between the quality of the lid (made of aluminum) and the bottom base (made of plastic) is huge; All recent AAA titles will run smoothly with a high refresh rate at highest configurations.Negative points: the sound quality is really, REALLY, bad. The speakers are horrible, it would be better not to have them and pay $100 less. Anyone would be surprised on how bad it is; the USB ports are on a strange position; the fans are very noisy, but maybe it is the price to pay for cooling a RTX (the temperatures are stable and OK during a gameplay), and you probably won't notice because you will be using a headset anyways.Summary: If you are looking for a powerful gaming laptop, are not willing to pay more than CAD 2000 and don't care about the sound quality, you should definitely buy the MSI GL65 Leopard.\n"", '\n  So far, after a few weeks, this thing is a beast for gaming. I came from a 2012 MBP. First thing I  noticed is the plastic casing, somewhat concerning but nevertheless it feels strong. The performance on this laptop is excellent for the money dished out. 2070 and new intel work great. 144hz screen is awesome for gaming.\n', ""\n  This might not be the highest end of the gaming laptop, but this thing is so POWERFULL.I'm usually a console gamer (very light let's say), but tried Warzone on this machine and I'm starting to believe those who said it's better to game on a PC, oops. I don't have much hour on the laptop, but at the first sight :Cons : The fan.. omg. Like other said it's the price to pay for the GPU, but I tought I started flight simulator with that noise (kidding!). Good news is : most of the time I'm working with a remote connection and fans are off which is awesome. Also, the HDD.. really ? Not even a TB ?Pros : Very compact, the screen is awesome and the keybord just the right size (red some complain about it). Speakers are OK also, lack of base but that's always like that. The price, try to have 2070 on a decent laptop, this is 2 to 3 hundred more easily, that's why you can sacrifice the HDD ;-)Thank you Amazon and MSI, hope it will be reliable now !\n"", '\n  Al mes de uso funciona perfecto, probando varios juegos AAA recientes no llega a calentarse más de 70c en calidades high a ultra y en 1080p, y no es necesario el turbo de los ventiladores que si son muy ruidosos,\n']"

I searched and researched for over 2 months looking at several different brands, why their good, versus another, why their bad. Whats equipped etc. and i came across this laptop. It was rocking 16 gigs of RAM, 1tb SSD, and a GTX 1650ti? All for this price tag? Too good to be true right? because EVERYTHING else was less for the same price. So i kept looking. I checked out the Lenovo Legion, the MSI, Dell, HP, Overpowered, and Acer. All great in their own way. But i wanted more bang for my buck. So i went back to this laptop. I chose it and pruchased it. It arrived a day early than what was initially stated and i booted it up for the first time. I went through the setup and boom, there i was at the desktop. I restarted the laptop to see how fast it was, what pre programs loaded up on startup (You know how alot of these have a buttload of programs all booting up when you turn on your pc and slows everything down) none of that happened. It was quick, back to the desktop. The laptop was open and free for me to install what i wanted without prompting me to use certain programs i didnt want. Which i loved. I had my classes to do that evening so i booted them up and the speed was WOW. No waiting at all. Everything loaded very quickly.I have to say, this laptop is the best bang for your buck you are going to find at this price range. Definitely worth it unless you just want to spend thousands of dollars on a laptop, in which case, why bother? Just build yourself a PC.\n', ""\n  So the noise issue?  There's a lotta horsepower under the hood and as a result it takes some heavy duty cooling.  When I am running Ram intensive games..... 8-10 gig RAM instensive, the fan kicks and hums along exhausting the heat....it appears to be well designed, just wish the fan was a tad quieter (not a reason to lower the rating). It's super fast at booting up....less than 20 secs powering up to ready to go each and every time.  Screen resolution is amazing.  I play 4x games like Civ 6, so it's hard to compare my results with those of you out there that play graphic intensive games...you know who you are.  Because there's a lot of horsepower to make gaming quick and responsive.One last comment, the sound....WOW, they put in good sound compared to the previous 8 laptops I have owned since 1999.  You will be well please with the rich AUDIO....all for  under $870?  Forget about it !\n"", '\n  I wish the seller was more honest regarding the laptop. The specs are not what they say they are. Will edit my review once I find out specs from the laptop itself. But box was suspicious with a white sticker covering the specs.Edit*** so laptop is accurate. Box is wrong. They should have a disclaimer that they upgraded the computer themselves.\n', '\n  The only thing that dislikes me is that whenever windows is updating, it sorts of sends you again to the set up windows screen that appears whenever you start the computer for the first time.\n', '\n  Love the screen quality\n', '\n  Nice laptop for gaming no lag smooth\n', '\n  Great\n']"
