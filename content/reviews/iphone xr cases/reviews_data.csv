There were a few things that I was specifically looking for in that original case.  1. Was there a lip to protect the screen from face down falls?  2. Was there hard plastic with a rubber sleeve to protect?  3. And was it slim enough to not feel like I was carrying a small book with me?The Spigen Tough Armor did it for me.  But there was one small annoying detail.  The sharp edges where angles met on the phone had some burrs from the manufacturing process and it ever so slightly rubbed my hand raw.  Over time it got a little better but I overlooked it.On this new model for the XR, not only did they get rid of the small burrs and made it super smooth, they added a kickstand for those moments when I want to watch something on a table or counter.  This case fits perfectly like a glove and I know it will give me the same level of protection that my previous case had.Thank you Spigen for this case.  I bought one for my wife as well!\n', '\n  I have always owned Otterbox or Lifeproof cases.  With the Otterbox cases, my family has had issues with the screen cracking, even with the case.  With Lifeproof, their saving grace is the lifetime warranty. The rubber on the buttons would fall apart.  The plastic over the home button would come unglued.  I owned the Lifeproof charging cases.  They always quit working after about a year.  This time, I wanted something different.  Spigen was recommended by a friend whom has had several Spigen cases.  I researched to decide between the cases.  I decided on the Tough Armor to gain as much protection as possible.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  It is sleek, and protective.  The price through Amazon is half of what I would have paid at Best Buy.  I have dropped my phone three times and I have had no issues.  I’m clumsy.  I would highly recommend this product for both quality and price.\n', ""\n  I really want to give this thing 5 stars, but I can't. The case itself is solid, and will protect your phone. The kickstand, which I thought was an excellent added bonus, is entirely useless. Unless there's a kickstand on both left and right sides, or, better yet, it's continuous from one side to the other, you might as well not have one at all. The moment I deploy the stand and try to set the phone down, it will skew to the right, and there's no way it will stay in place. Believe me, lovely as it sounds, the stand offers zero benefit. As it is, I'd pay $12 for his case, not a penny more.\n"", ""\n  I was worried about how well the phone would fit because the  Xr was so new (I ordered the case before the first batch of iPhone Xr's arrived), but the Spigen Tough Armor fits perfectly. The material is flexible but thick enough to provide lots of protections from drops.  I like the raised height of the case edges above the front-glass.  If you lay the iPhone Xr face-down on a table, there is about a penny-thickness between the glass and the table. One minor problem, the Apple Logo on the back is off-center (see photo). So Spigen got the important things right (the physical fit), but was off on the back logo.  I wanted to take .5 points, off but can't, so its 4-stars instead of 5-stars\n"", '\n  Wow. I put this case on almost as soon as I got my phone a month ago, took it off today because my phone was acting up, and saw the entire back of my phone was totally shattered.I’ve dropped it once or twice, nothing crazy, and never had any indicator of it being cracked. I wish I just got any other phone case because this doesn’t do anything! It just LOOKS durable. Absolutely useless\n', '\n  I recently purchased an iPhone XR.  Nice phone!  So of course, I want to protect it.  Found this on Amazon and it seemed like a great price and looked great.  It states on the site that it is Military Grade Protection, however, there is not a single reference to such certification on the box it came in.  Simply a logo stating, ""Ultimate Everyday Protection"". What does that mean?  So, I put it on still and here is what I found (see pictures for reference).  Design is nice looking and case is thin and light.  The red backing is more of a plastic than the metallic finish it shows.  The Apple logo is not EXACTLY centered, but close enough for me.  My previous case didn\'t allow the logo to be seen at all.  The back is thick enough so that the camera lens will not be scratched if place on a table.  No worries there.  The kickstand is very flimsy and I am certain the slight pressure when used will probably break it off.  But that is just an added bonus.  My main concern, however, are the edges of the case are not thick enough to protect the screen in my opinion compared to the OtterBox I have for it.  I have a screen protector on it and you can see from the picture that the edge it almost flush with the screen leaving little to no space to keep the screen protected if placed face down.  The ports are open and fine.  I was able to plug in my Apple certified charger with no issues that other users stated they encountered.  I use AirPods so not worried about headphone connection either, but I did plug in the Apple Adapter dongle for wired headphones to see if an issue and there were no issues.  For the price, this is a nice case.  I don\'t know if I will keep it because I don\'t feel this case is as durable as the OtterBox.  But, I like the look and weight of it better.  I will use it for a few days and update this post if there are things to add.\n', ""\n  I had a case just like this for my 6s and never had any complaints about it. I dropped that phone many times and it never even got a scratch. So, when I upgraded to the XR, I naturally wanted something similar and ended up with this case. The kickstand works well, pops in and out fairly easily. It sets the phone at a good viewing angle if you are sitting at a desk/table. The case slides in and out of pockets with relative ease, and I assume it protects the phone just as well as my old case since they are practically the same.The apple logo on the back of the phone is off center, so that's a bummer. But hey, I got this case right before the XR was even available to be purchased, so it's understandable. Hopefully Spigen can modify the design slightly to more closely align the apple logo in the center of the circle.\n"", '\n  Pour chacun de mes téléphones j\'ai toujours choisi ce modele. J\'en suis parfaitement satisfait depuis des années. La coque protège parfaitement le téléphone et résiste parfaitement aux chutes accidentelles. L\'épaisseur de la coque permet néanmoins le rechargement du téléphone avec les chargeurs à induction.Mon épouse a également adopté cette coque et nous n\'avons aucun souci avec.En un mot, si vous tenez à votre téléphone, je recommande !(Si vous avez apprécié ce retour, votez ""Commentaire utile"" ! ça fait toujours plaisir)\n', '\n  I’ve used Spigen cases previously, albeit the lighter versions, which have always looked stylish and felt good in the hand.Due to the XR’s full body screen, I decided to go with a tough armour case for this phone.It doesn’t disappoint, fits quickly and easily on the phone (is one piece so doesn’t require assembly) and protects the phone well.It’s quite bulky, so when added to the XR (which is already big), makes quite a chunk to hold, but feels great and would highly recommend.\n', ""\n  I've now dropped this half a dozen times, without any damage to the phone at all, and it's fairly light so perfect balance between protection and bulk.  Crucially, it does not block the camera lens. The little stand has even turned out to be useful for skype chats, etc.  It's not a complete cover, in that it doesn't cover the screen, but it does provide a slight edge to protect it from damage if you drop it. And as the new iphone is water resistant, full coverage isn't such an issue.  Very happy with this.\n"", '\n  The cover gives great protection and to do this it adds some bulk to an already large Iphone XR. The issues I have is to find a case which allows the use of a magnetic disc for car mounting and also does not interfere with wireless charging.The upper part of the phone can be used to apply a metal disc which does not interfere with wireless charging  as this occurs with contact to the middle of the phone. If placed in this fashion the metal disc does not interfere with wireless charging and does not get hot as a consequence. However the case is quite thick and reduces the magnetic effect  for such mounts and the phone has a habit of falling off the dash mount when encountering bumps in the road. The solution would be to stick the metal disc on the outside of the case but to achieve positioning to enable wireless charging the disk has to be placed on the case where there is a hole to show off the apple logo on the back of the phone so there is not enough adhesive surface to allow the the disc to stay in place for long. This case would be great if there was no hole! There are lots of cases available for the XR but this particular issue has not been addressed. Many people wish to use their smart phone as a Sat nav in the car and the move toward magnetic mounts interferes with wireless charging unless the metal disc can be deployed at the top of the phone adjacent to the camera.\n', '\n  This makes my XR feel solid and it will easily survive a drop now, even if it lands on its face. The black frame also contrasts really well against the black bezel on the phone and in my opinion frames the screen really well. No issues with using the volume or lock buttons on the sides either. I’ve a blue XR and I’m pleased with how it looks in the black case but it was a tough call between it and the blue case. I should have got this ages ago. The kickstand also works well and is at a perfect angle for watching movies or videos. The packaging the case arrives in is also great as it avoids unnecessary single use plastic too.\n']"

Plus free shipping as well if that helps anyone out\n', '\n  Just received my case today and I wanted to share.  It seems like a good solid case.  There are two things that I’m worried about - the magnetic flap seems a bit flimsy and it’s sort of in way when you’re using the device.. it can be tucked behind the phone during use, so that helps.  The other thing is you can’t put too much in the card slots or pocket behind them, the flap doesn’t attach securely enough if you do, but for the basic stuff it’s good, it may loosen up too - and/or maybe I’m just spoiled by another brand I fell in love with with my previous iPhone model and they don’t have cases yet available for the newer phones.Overall it’s a nice case, good quality, but just wanted to share a few things I’ve noticed in the one day I’ve had it.\n', '\n  I love this case! At first I was put off from the price but it’s definitely worth it. Real leather, stays shut even with cards in it and does everything I was wanting in a case. It does mark up easily as it’s a soft leather so if you want a case that doesn’t do that then this isn’t the case for you, and also, it does smell like leather, go figure. I prefer the magnet closure, it makes opening and keeping it closed easy and even though it’s now slightly thicker than a slimmer case, this still fits in my pockets. And I get compliments on it everywhere I go, it shows quality.\n', ""\n  I bought two cases, one in Brown and one in Plum, for our new XRs.  Both very well made.  As mentioned, the soft nap of the leather shows wear marks but that adds to the look of the leather.  The brown is, obviously, classic and warm. I was pleased that the plum is also a lovely shade, not too bright or unnatural looking, and the peeks of coral from the phone look don't clash.  Plus the silicone holder is clear so you can actually see the color of the phone.  I like to be colorful but not garish and this combo works.  Magnets are sufficiently strong to hold the case closed.  It's a bit bulky but that's also just me getting used to how big the XR is compared to the 7 i've carried for 3 years!  I am only carrying 2 cards and a few bills and it closes and stays closed fine.  I do think if you stuffed the pockets it would get bulky and bulge.  I carry a separate wallet but for travel it will be nice to be able to have cards, cash and ID handy.  So far the front flap is not getting in the way of taking photos, but the tab does sort of poke at your eye when talking on the phone unless you secure it to the magnet.  Overall I am very satisfied and would definitely recommend.\n"", '\n  I ordered the honey wallet for an iphone Xr. Delivery was fast, and the wallet is beautiful. However, the closure mechanism is too short to adequately fasten the wallet closed--that is, if you have more than three cards and three dollar bills inside. I really like the case (and really wanted the chartreuse color--but debated too long when purchasing and it sold out). However, I am super bummed that the wallet doesn\'t hold what I need it to hold.  Haven\'t decided if I want to return it or just keep it and not use it as I intended.  Also, the phone case portion is attached to the wallet ONLY on the right side of the phone; all four points of the ""case"" are not fully attached to the wallet. And, I\'m still testing the wallet, but it seems to activate the screen on my phone rather easily. I am hoping this won\'t be a problem going forward. Overall nice wallet and construction but poor design with respect to functionality. Super bummed it doesn\'t meet my expectations -- especially given the high price.\n', '\n  Although the magnet is pretty strong..  I would like everything bigger so if one did stuff a bit too much it would still be secure and it is NOT.  Next the slots for the credit cards are very tight and up too high so the top card almost sticks out.  The leather inside is not the same as the great leather outside..  A bit stiff.  It is quality for sure and many will like it.  I love the leather on the outside.. But I probably will send back.  It was a toss up between this and another brand which does not have this quality of leather but I believe more functional.  I use the other brand on my iPhone 8 so I bought for the XR along with this as I like brown but....\n', '\n  The case itself is lovely. However, as soon as I placed the iPhone XR into the case, everyone I had calls with said that they could hardly hear me. As soon as I removed the phone from the case, everyone said that they could hear me fine. It seems that the gel type strip across the bottom of the case does not have cut out holes for where the mic holes are either side of the charging port.\n', ""\n  I want to give 5 stars as I was very happy with my first Snakehive case for my iPhone 6 so I decided to get one for my new iPhone XR, but unfortunately people say they can't hear me or the sound quality is very feint, but its ok without the cover on.I've checked the cut-outs for the microphone and they appear to be lined up so not sure what the issue is. Hopefully someone from Snakehive will see this and help me to resolve the issue as I really like the quality of the product and would like to give it 5 stars.\n"", '\n  Nice easy to open and close function. However, to hold the phone to take a call you have to fold the front cover to the back of the phone which blocks the microphone hole and muffles your voice so the person receiving your call cannot hear you properly. You then have to grip the phone on the outer edges to allow the front cover to be kept away from the rear of the phone which makes taking/making a call very difficult and a risk of dropping the phone because you can’t get a proper purchase. Plus the front cover does not auto close the phone screen and so you have to manually switch off or set the screen to automatically go in standby mode. The quality of the leather is good but the outer finish is a swede type and very quickly gathers a shiny worn look.\n', ""\n  I'm always wary of buying phone cases as the quality of the leather varies so much, from real thru thin thru plastic. This buy was a good one. Very soft leather, well stitched, a good magnet and exactly the appearance I want. Very highly recommended if you want the genuine article.**UPDATE** I've had this for a couple of weeks now and have revised the rating from 5 to 3 for two reasons:1) the leather (despite VERY light use) has already started to shine and the magnet is now clearly pushing through.2) even though the silicone mount has cutouts for the speaker & mic, everyone I've spoken to has said how muffled the sound is at their end.A minor point but relevant is that the leather has an odd chemical smell, which I wouldn't have expected from a case costing this much. I'll keep it but buyer beware.**UPDATE #2** It's been returned as the people at the other end simply couldn't hear me until I removed the phone from the holder. I've made & received probably close to 100 calls and EVERY time I had to take it out. Disappointed but it's totally impractical.....\n"", ""\n  This is my 3rd Snakeskin case (get a new one when phone model changes), and I honestly would not go anywhere else to get a case for my iphone. They are beautifully made, and the silicon/plastic cradle holds the phone tight. Yes it's a little stiff when it first arrives, but after use, it becomes soft and malleable, and the leather achieves a lovely patina. The leather does admittedly go through a stage of looking worse before it gets better, but stick with it because it really is worth it.The 3 slots are just enough to carry a couple of bank cards and driving licence without it becoming bulky and i've personally never had an issue with poor call quality.My only niggle is, because of the cover,  it's a bit cumbersome to hold when taking photos, but i've taken 100s of photos and it doesn't deter me. At the end of the day, I'd much rather protect my expensive phone from scratches and bumps, as well as it looking good. I can carry it around in my bag and know its well protected.I've recommended to so many people - most of my family and in laws use one now. i should be on commission!\n""]"
