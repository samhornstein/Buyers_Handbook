The 1920x1080 resolution provides a crisp and sharp image.  The case is lightweight plastic which makes it perfect for using on arms.  Everything you need to quickly have it set up is included in the box.\n', ""\n  \xa0Working from home is the new normal, so I bought this monitor. I found this one cheaper than the monitors in other stores and brand. The monitor is definitely high quality and strong build. Its very light weight and very much energy efficient. It uses HDMI for input and has one HDMI input so no need to switch between inputs. This eliminates the hassle of searching the menu button and switching when using multiple inputs. I have two laptops so I use a HDMI switch and one out in the monitor. The monitor is very bright and the default settings are more than enough to use it. Its high resolution and wide screen 16:9 aspect ratio. Perfect for working on excel sheets as it gives extra room for more columns. Even small fonts look very sharp. The mount is little thin which makes the monitor shake when I type, due to vibration. I don't think that is a big problem. This monitor also supports wall mounting, although mounting accessory is not provided. It needs external power and the power cord is supplied. I wish the power cord was little bit longer.Overall, I really liked this monitor. I switched my primary monitor from my mac book screen to this screen.\n"", '\n  \xa0I had previously purchased a 15.6 inch portable screen by Auzai that was as thick as an Ipad to store with my laptop.  Based on that purchase this monitor appeared in recommended by amazon and it was time to upgrade my corner desk with laptop setup.Since I already had a samsung 23 inch curved monitor on my dual monitor arm, I chose to configure this screen vertically in portrait mode using the vesa mount screws on the back.  With the Auzai logo facing the right or letters going from down to upward direction, this put the power  and hdmi cable in an ideal position to hide behind my samsung that was located to the right.  The power button and menu adjustment buttons will be located at the top if needed.  This would allow me to switch between VGA and HDMI but I primarily use the HDMI input on my setup.The colors are clear and crisp with tight pixels that I do not even notice even when sitting less than 2 feet away at times.This allows me to easy viewing without scrolling on long web pages, word documents, and excel spreadsheets formatted in letter/legal.  At this $100 price point with prime shipping this is must have for any work from home setup.\n', ""\n  \xa0The monitor comes very well packed, which is always a concern I have when buying one through the mail. It's got extremely thin bezels on the sides and top so you could sit monitors next to each other with minimal breaking up of the image. It's not curved, but a 24 inches it doesn't really need to be. It's got a nice high refresh rate of 75 MHz, so video playback and streaming looks really good on it. The listing claims a fast response time as well, but since I haven't found documentation for that all I can say is that I haven't seen any lag. It's got FHD resolution so you don't see any pixelation on displayed images. The stand it comes with is minimalist, allowing a little bit of tilting up and down, but I intend to use the monitor on a monitor arm attached to the desk, and the fact that it has VESA mounting holes is a major plus for me. He claims hundred 78° wide viewing angle, and when I look at it from a sharp angle this seems to be borne out. I don't see any fading of the colors the matter what side or how far to the side I view the monitor from. Speaking of the colors, they are bright, crisp and deep.\n"", '\n  \xa0I like this monitor a whole lot. I have not gotten to use a 24 inch monitor before and it is gorgeous. The picture quality is amazing and it worked immediately as soon as I plugged it in in the box. There is very little black space on the edges on top of the monitor so the screen goes edge to edge basically. I was a little confused because it looks like there might be a film on top of the monitor like a protective film, but I tried picking at the corners and I couldn’t get a sheet to come up or anything and I didn’t want to mess anything up so I stopped playing with it. It works really well with hdmi and I can’t get over how nice the picture is.\n', '\n  \xa0This in a great monitor with an HDMI and VGA connection and a refresh rate as high as 75Hz.Videos and games are smooth and don’t lag at all on 75Hz and the viewing angle is great if you are off to one side or the other. I love that it has three micro edged bezels on this. You almost can’t see them when using this and they just blend in with the screen.This monitor does tilt up and down, but will not rotate in portrait mode. The on/off and set up buttons are on the bottom right side of the bezel and easy to find, push, and use when needed.\n', '\n  Awesome monitor with VESA mounting! this monitor has an excellent 1080p resolution, perfect for homework, work from home and gaming on my Xbox series X! this is a light weight monitor, yet very stable!!! the back loos super beautiful! a very nice design with lines, good to keep in mind it it is not mounted on the wall :) simple to plug in form the back , then the input  the frame if this monitor is very slim and I love it! this monitor image looks great from all angles, top , bottom, right, left!\n']"

I had two 24” monitors and thought I was doing great. I wanted one that I could retake to portrait but quickly fell in love with this in landscape. I removed one of my smaller ones and if my desk had the room I would get another 27”. Comes with DVI and HDMI cables. Only downfall is the power cord is short but if your desk is against a wall or your desk has a power strip it won’t be an issue.You can’t see in the picture but the picture quality is much better than my small monitor and it is brighter/whiter.I also like the led lights on the back of the monitor.

The assembly was pretty easy it took about 10 minutes to get it setup and ready to go.  The monitor can be easily adjusted to the correct height and angle.  One of the best parts of this monitor is the ability to easily raise and lower the monitor with just a finger.  It glides up and down smoothly. On the backside of the monitor there are two nice led lights that create a really great a fun atmosphere.  The monitor stand is very stable and keeps the monitor from moving around.  The monitor is edge less so the entire monitor is the screen.  The picture quality is fantastic the colors are bright and clear and there is absolutely no lag or blurring.  Overall I am very impressed with the quality of this monitor, the refresh rate is fantastic, the colors are bright and the monitor adjust easily\n', '\n  First, I am glad I did not hesitate for too long and bought this monitor before they increased the price. The monitor is beyond precise. The picture quality is like every screenshot can be used as a desktop screen. The motor stand is cool as well. It can rotate in 3 dimensions, I especially like it can hold the screen up high as I can raise my head slightly sometime to change the rigid gesture when movie/game for too long time, good for my neck. Lastly, they also give a free gift of your choice, like a speaker, gaming mouse...., the method for how to get it is in the box of the monitor.\n', ""\n  Absolutely gorgeous monitor!

I was not expecting much for a low-end monitor at a rock bottom price, but have to admit I am pleasantly surprised.  Really, no cons at this price point.  Pluses:1.  Very clear, sharp screen for a 1600 x 900 display.  Has a better picture than a new 1920 x 1080 HP monitor I have.2.  Very good standard color saturation - not washed out at all.  I did not feel the need to adjust color or brightness settings.3.  Good font clarity and sharpness.4.  Has integrated speakers, a nice surprise for such  an inexpensive monitor, where many higher-end models don't include speakers.  Speakers are not incredibly loud but are very clear and not tinny.  The speakers work through the DVI to HDMI cable and there is no need for an extra audio cable.5.  Comes with a DVI-D to HDMI cable as well as a standard VGA to VGA cable.  Monitor has a VGA output and two HDMI outputs, as well as audio outputs if you would rather not use the integrated speakers.6.  The monitor stand snaps to the base, and the stand screws into the monitor with just two screws.  There is a strong hinge built in which allows easy tilting for your viewing preferences.  Took a couple minutes to assemble.7.  Box comes with a screwdriver, so you don't need to have tools of your own.8.  Nice color-coded ports on the back.This is my first Sceptre monitor and based on this, I will be likely to consider this brand again.  Very pleased.\n"", '\n  Pros: Easy set up of stand. Comes with several cable options. Speakers are \'decent\'.Cons: Everything else.I bought this monitor for a 2nd work monitor to connect to my laptop. I didn\'t need it to ""do"" much, I just needed a little extra desktop real estate.This shipped with a dead pixel. I could live with that if that was the only thing wrong with it. Eye strain was immediate upon viewing the monitor. Light leak around the edges is terrible. The picture quality is awful at both 60 and 75 Hz.Text appeared jagged. Images were washed out. I connected to my PS4 and the results were equally disappointing. Do not purchase if you are thinking about using this as a gaming monitor. Do no purchase this if you are thinking about ANY monitor.I was using this as a \'trial\' monitor for other Sceptre monitors. I was interested in some of their larger, curved monitors, but based off the quality of this monitor, I will happily spend a little more money to get a trusted, name brand monitor.\n', '\n  The monitor is large which I love and it has very good picture quality. The monitor does not adjust for height (  it does not move up or down ).  It does however, tilt up or down which works fine for me. It is very easy to set up and there is no installation needed. The monitor comes with all cables you need.  Great value for the money!\n', '\n  Easy to set up and use. Product was in perfect condition. The screen is very clear. Now I am ready to start my work from home. Will be ordering another one soon. I use this with my labtop using only an HDMI cord.\n', '\n  TLDR:Thankfully out of all the bad reviews I gambled and I got a good working monitor and it seems to be working as promised so far. The headphone jack is garbage but fortunately, it\'s not a deal-breaker because the monitor sound is good. It\'s really only 18"" and they may leave it at your door in the product box so all your neighbors and passerbys can see you bought a monitor. Read full review for details.So I\'ve been shopping around for a couple of weeks now trying to put together a decent little gaming computer and when I finally got around to shopping for the monitor... here\'s this lovely monitor for only $88.... can\'t be right. I click and read through the specs....this can\'t be right. Then I look through the reviews... about 300/4000 (4/11/2020) reviews were 1 stars with sound issues, screen issues, power cord issues, one-and-done then never coming back on, and just plain crappy craftsmanship.That being said... the numbers.... 300/4000 are what convinced me to at least give it a try... I mean for $88 bucks and with amazon return/refund policy the worst that would happen is that I get a dud and I just don\'t repurchase the monitor and I find a  better one. So I ordered it.PROS(ish)I received it today.. plugged it in... and held my breath as pressed the power button. IT LIVES! There\'s one big complaint/ 1-star rating worry crushed.I hook it up to my laptop... I jump over to Youtube to test the sound... IT SINGS! Another hurdle/ 1-star  rating worry crushed.I then unplug everything and properly set it up ( I didn\'t set up the stand or other bits because I didn\'t want to have to re-wrap and pack if I got a dud)... I set up the stand and place it on my desk with my other things and plug it up again... IT COMES BACK TO LIFE!I put in my copy of Avatar to test the 1080p they boast about for the monitor and IT LOOKS GORGEOUS!CONS So now most of my biggest 1-star worries are crushed however there are 3 non-deal-breakers that I have with the monitor.It has an audio jack for headphones but the sound is so grainy and there\'s a lot of noise. I tried several different headphones and they all sound like garbage unless you turn it down to lower volume where you can\'t hear the noise. SO while the sound from the monitor is great the sound for headphones is garbage.Next, 20"" they say? I don\'t want to make a ""boys can measure joke"" but... it\'s really only 18""... so if you\'re really looking for those extra 2"" they aren\'t there.Lastly, is a shipping issue... the box they ship it in is the product box, like fresh off the shelf at a store. Guys, you\'re sending this to someones house/apartment?! Thankfully I was home when it was delivered and I got an email from Amazon letting me know my delivery was close by BUT what is I hadn\'t been home? Someone could have easily seen exactly what I ordered and taken from my porch. While I understand that Amazon/Whoever-sold-it is not responsible for porch theft ... you could at least make it more discreet and lessen the chance of someone wanting to steal it.Thanks and ""May the odds be ever in your favor""\n', '\n  A very good value. I just needed a 20"" monitor to replace one that had gone bad on a two-monitor system-I needed to match the size so that was important. I hadn\'t heard of Sceptre, but the reviews were positive, so I ordered one. It arrived in two days, well packaged and padded. I was impressed that a screwdriver and two different connector cables were included with the purchase. Assembly was easy and intuitive. Plugged it in and connected to my computer and it booted right up. I\'ve used it for one day and have been quite pleased. I imagine if it was side by side with a gaming display I might notice some quality disparities, but for my purposes this works extremely well. It takes up less space on my desk than the previous monitor while maintaining the same display area.\n', '\n  What a waste of money!  If you are in Canada, do not buy this as you are not able to register this product for warranty.  I specifically searched out a small monitor with built-in speakers as my old one of 32 years with built-in speakers finally died.  Got this one and you can barely hear anything with the monitor on 100% and your windows on 100%. Finally got ahold of these people and was told to plug in external speakers!!!!  That made it even worse., so yes there is something definitely wrong with the internal speakers, but now I have to ship it back at my expense to have it repaired.  Probably not worth the shipping, might have to buy a new monitor elsewhere.\n', '\n  These are great monitors.  I had to order them because it was mandatory to work from home  with the Virus outbreak. Took a bit to get here as they were selling a lot online.  Had some issues registering these for warranty.  Only has US Address to enter in.  I have emailed the company to find out if the warranty is good for Canadians\n', '\n  De entrada el cable de alimentación ya me había generado desconfianza por ser tan delgado y con un alimentador tan corriente, pero al momento de conectarla y prenderla mi mayor molestia fue que la pantalla no dejó de meter interferencia en la parte posterior de la pantalla de forma intermitente cada 10 segundos, intenté configurarla a otra frecuencia, cambiar el puerto HDMI, incluso conectarla directamente a corriente y nada funcionó.

Si eres muy exigente, busca otra opción.\n', '\n  La pantalla es sencillamente mala, desde que me llego note una mancha en la parte inferior izquierda de la pantalla, pensé que se quitaría conectandola a mi pc y no se quito, probé cambiando cables y de todo, hasta la probe en mi xbox , y jamas se quito, no se que paso por que no esta mas que en el estado que me llego, según nueva , adjuntare fotos, puede que haya sido por ensamblaje pero eso ya no lo se, pague por algo nuevo y por eso mismo la devolvere, inicie hoy mismo el rembolso, nunca habia tenido una mala experiencia en amazon hasta hoy, ademas la imagen de la pantalla es muy mala, la calidad de video se ve muy baja, los colores son malos y las bocinas apenas y se escuchan, no la recomiendo para nada, espero que todo salga bien en la devolucion, informare mas tarde. No la recomiendo, gasten un poco mas por uno full hd y evitense la pena que yo pase.\n']"

Does it have superb color and contrast? No. Does it boast the best refresh rate on the market? No. But if you're tight on money, this thing looks and preforms great for the money. It has a Matte screen which does a great job at eliminating glare. The chassis it's enclosed within is absolutely stunning. It features a VGA and and HDMI port. The screen automatically detects signals and turns on when a source is turned on. When the selected source turns off it quickly scans and switches to any other sources. If no connections are available it goes into standby automatically. The power chord is a good 6 or more feet and easy to wrap with half of it being very thin wire. The ON LED is not distracting or too bright. When it's off it looks like a borderless monitor. And unlike what other people say it does have tilt, just not forward or left to right. It stands up straight or leans back. Unfortunately it doesn't have VESA mount holes, but under 100 you can't be that serious about your monitor setup. Small text has some problems fully rendering when using VGA so I recommend using HDMI. If you use the Windows 10 settings to configure how text is displayed though it fixes this, but not all will know how to do that. It doesn't have speaker, and I am thankful that most monitors don't. This monitor has A LOT of settings for gaming, night use, color adjustments, and general settings and all can be saved into 3 different gaming profiles. You can even change what settings appear in the quick menu. When u press any of the menu buttons, the menu pops up and clearly illustrates all the buttons. This monitors menus are super easy to understand and navigate and that's a rarity in its own. Also worth noting; it can display crosshairs and display the monitors current refresh rate. It also packs FreeSync for AMD graphics card users. If you only have DVI, you can get DVI to HDMI chords as long as your computer's video out supports it. The base and monitor couple together with one screw that features a hand flap so you don't need a screw diver if you don't want to use one. It is decently sturdy and the screen doesn't distort even when pressed on with strong pressure. The base is quite large, but wont be a problem for most. I haven't noticed any screen delay compared to my 300 dollar 1ms response time monitor (and I'm pretty picky). It's contrast is a little flat in some scenarios but appears much more dynamic in games, especially with some tweaking. With that said, I like that it looks flat when working on documents because it makes it much easier to focus.All in all, this monitor is filled with a good balance of features and looks like a very solid 1080p 75Hz IPS screen for any monitor under $160, let alone the $80 I paid. If you don't absolutely need a better refresh rate and aren't planning on spending more than 200 dollars then I would say just buy this monitor. It's durable, feature packed, and looks fantastic in all use-case scenarios. I'd give it 1000 stars if I could.\n"", ""\n  I've seen many other reviews saying this monitor does not tilt, but it in fact does. I'm guessing people didn't take a close enough look at the hinge mechanism in the base, which attaches to the main display and allows for backwards tilt of approximately 15 degrees. The monitor is very light, thin, has small bezels, and produces reasonably good colors. It doesn't have a vesa mount, but I knew that before purchasing it, and wasn't planning to mount it. For $89, it is a great value.\n"", ""\n  Aside from my computer and PS4, this is probably one of the best things I've ever purchased. I use it every single day without error and everything always looks amazing. I'm a broke college kid and really needed something sufficient for PS4, homework, movies, everything really. I was torn between this and the HP pavilion and I have no regrets from picking this one! The screen is definitely big enough (perfect for having multiple pages open for homework) and is insanely vibrant and good quality for the price. I have absolutely no complaints, and even with a horrible $2 thunderbolt to HDMI cable for my Mac, it still looks absolutely amazing.\n"", '\n  I just got this monitor few days ago and setting up literally took a minute. Colors are so vibrant and bright. Darks are good and brights are rich.  I work in a IT field and I’ve seen and used a lot of monitors, this is by far the best I’ve used till date. I’ve only used vga and it’s already better than using hdmi in most of the monitors. I can only imagine what it would be after using with an hdmi cable. Its a steal for the price I got.\n', ""\n  I am somewhat satisfied with my purchase. The price was great, and looks great too. Easy to assemble. Came with vga and power cord. Colors look amazing, no annoying power indicator lights. The options menu is very easy to navigate. I didn't want to do this, but I had to dock a star as it lacked the ability to tilt. It's at a permanent position so I'm gonna have to stack an extra book below to go the position I want. Otherwise, 10/10\n"", ""\n  Read over the reviews at least 10 times weighing the pros and cons but I decided to go for it and I'm glad that I did! Like others stated, it took maybe 5-6 minutes to unpack and get up and running. I wanted a larger screen to use when I work from home as my 10 inch laptop keeps me squinting and bending over. The monitor is SUPER lightweight and very sleek. It comes with the VGA cord but no HDMI cord, luckily I have several laying around the house. I did have to prop it up a bit in the front since there is no tilt option, but that wasn't a deal breaker for me. I use this for basic internet and word processing, no gaming or watching movies and it's been working great for me!\n"", '\n  This is a basic, no frills, monitor with a beautiful picture & well deserved reputation for lasting a long time.  No built in speaker, get a different model if that is what you want.  Not for the novice, as the only usable instruction is ""turn off computer before installing"".  There are 5 buttons on the bottom edge of the monitor, but pictograms are useless.  But, don\'t worry; after you make all connections & power up the computer & monitor, the monitor checks connections & automatically picks the correct settings for you.  If you have an HDMI connection on your computer (preferably on the back panel), use that instead of the VGA cable to get the best quality picture.  (You must supply the cable.)\n', ""\n  You can't really expect much from a monitor that is less than $100, but this is a great monitor for everyday use. The only reason I give it 4 our of 5 stars is because there is no way to mount this on a wall or versa mount. Other than that, great clarity, color and size for the price point. I will be finding a way to mount this on my versa mount as looking down on a monitor is not conducive to prolonged use.\n"", ""\n  This monitor really knocked my socks off!  I was expecting just another monitor, like my old one.  I needed a new one for my wife so I grabbed this.  It isn't kidding when they say it is thin.  It's very light weight, which doesn't matter to me much.  The colour quality is top notch and response is perfect, no blurriness or anything.  But what surprised me is that I will sometimes watch videos on it, and when I do, I will move to a livingroom chair I have in the corner to watch it which sits lower.  With my old monitor that would make the video much darker and I would have to adjust it so that the monitor was facing almost directly at me to get a good image.  With this one, I sat down and the image was just fine without even turning it or angling it down or anything!!!  It didn't get darker, very minimal glare on it.  The black is nice and black like it should be (with some nice options in the monitor settings to adjust the blackness).  It has a ton of settings for the monitor.  The refresh rate of 75 is nice.  I'm a casual gamer and it is perfect for that, the colours in my game really looked nice.  I can't say enough about this, I was FINALLY pleasantly surprised (as opposed to so much I have purchased that didn't work).  Well worth the money by far!\n"", '\n  relación calidad-precio exacta, pagas por lo que tiene este monitor, lastimosamente es un monitor de 6bits + frc no es de 8 bits verdaderos, esto sirve para gaming por la respuesta tan rápida que tiene pero no para ver colores buenos, en realidad no tiene buenos colores, en general se ven deslavados pero no puedo pedir mas por este precio tan bajo. en cuanto ángulos de visión... tienes que estar directo a el, no puedes verlo de ningún lado porque veras el sangrado de luz de fondo o los colores aun mas deslavados, tiene muy buen brillo, de echo te lastima si lo pones al máximo en la noche, es extremadamente brillante. por default mi tarjeta nvidia lo detecta como un monitor de 75hz, escondiendo los otros modos de 60 hz 50 hz 30hz 25hz 24 hz 23.7 hz. tiene buena nitidez y tiene buenos negros pero repito existe el sangrado de luz de fondo aunque no sea tan severo y repito es bueno para gaming no para colores vivos o ver películas con colores vibrantes y bonitos. Lo que si me molesta de estos paneles es que ni en la pagina oficial mencionan el echo de que es de 6 bits y no 8, lo cual si marca una gran diferencia en rango dinamico y colores, si de por si 8 bits tiene colores pobres, imaginen 6bits: terribles.Es mi primer monitor y no tengo mucho dinero entonces vale la pena.Eso si estoy impresionado con lo delgado que esta el panel pero en si su diseño no es muy bonito que digamos.\n', ""\n  Edit of my original review.Is this the greatest monitor? Probably not. Do I use it fine? Of course. If you want perfect brightness distribution then go buy another monitor. The two bottom corners have noticeable bright spots that can be a bit distracting when the monitor is displaying darker backgrounds. Overall, I'm giving this monitor 5/5 because it works great. I use it to play games and have no complaints.I've never had a higher refresh rate than 60Hz but I personally wouldn't spend too much more on any higher because I find games are playable at this refresh rate and FPS it provides. Would I spend more money on a higher resolution and higher refresh rate eventually? Maybe. But for now, this works great.Buy this monitor if you're not too serious about insane detail.\n"", '\n  Compré este monitor por el simple hecho de que era un 1080p 75hz de Acer. Me sorprendió que estas características estuviese a sólo 1,700mxn. No esperaba mucho de él, pero en estos tres meses me dio una gran sorpresa.El monitor es increíblemente liviano y delgado.

Very cute and slim in appearance. Manages space on my work table as I have another larger monitor too. Pix quality and resolution was great and a lot better than what I had before.

This is a matte which is more suitable office work. The matte finish helps to offset office lighting and the sun from reflecting on the screen. I still enjoy watching a video on this monitor and gaming is fine. I\'m not implying otherwise.Pros:1- The screen is BRIGHT! Turn it down. I prefer a monitor that you have to turn down brightness rather than the other way around!2- It\'s very lightweight and easy to move around.3- Even after being on for a while it does not get very warm.4- I like the way the menu is set up and the physical on/off button has a light touch so you don\'t to ""gorilla"" it.Cons:1- So the I mentioned I like the matte screen and yet LG pulled a typical LG-ish move. The bezel around the screen is SHINY plastic. So what you may say? If you are looking at a dark video for example, that shiny plastic reflects whatever light is around so the it looks like there\'s led light embedded in the bezel frame! LOL...2- Again, another typical LG-ish move; both the video cable AND the power cable are too short. Unless of course you have the monitor sitting right next to your PC. Even then, the power cable is a 3 prong unit. It\'s kind of like, come on LG, you couldn\'t add another 12 to the length? Lame-O. I found a good deal here on Amazon for a longer cable and I moved my UPS protector to compensate for the short power cable length.3- The base is made of plastic. No big deal but you have to be careful when changing the angle of your screen. Don\'t gorilla it.To finish up; none of the Cons are deal-breakers. This is a nice monitor for the price and I\'m very happy with it. If LG were to charge another $15 retail and fix the details I mentioned above it would still be a nice value.\n', '\n  Monitors were visibly broken. You didn’t have to turn them on to know the image would be totally distorted by the black streak shown in the attached photos. This was not a casual mistake.  Marked a star because the page didn’t give a Zero choice\n', '\n  Pros:+ Very large, especially for the price. Great for my home office.+ Picture quality and color are really nice+ Minimal glare, even in the sun+ Plug and play, easy set upCons:- The display was deteriorated significantly by interference when using a VGA adapter to connect to my laptop. The severity of this rendered the screen largely useless. Replacing this connection with an HDMI cable totally fixed the problem, and the display now looks excellent. This, however, is problematic because only a VGA cable is included in the box, it would be nice if an HDMI was included.- The height of the stand is fixed, you can not adjust it upwards or downwards.\n', ""\n  I already have one LG monitor that I use as my primary display and it has been perfect for me. So, of course, I bought another LG (a cheaper one no less) to use as my secondary monitor. Welp, this one didn't fair so well. I received the monitor, set it up, plugged it in...no light indicator. So weird! I immediately called LG to find out if I had the correct AC Adapter and they informed me that the one I had was not correct. I thought, cool, I'll get a new one through Amazon and be on my way!The new AC adapter arrived today...still dead. Ugh, very frustrating. Just put in my return with Amazon and shipped it off a few moments ago. Now I need to wait for my refund so I can buy a new monitor. You lost me LG.\n"", '\n  Do not like this at all. I would have sent it back but the box got tossed out before I had a chance to set it up. My laptop screen  will normally have an extended option but on this monitor, the whole screen doesn’t show up.

Don’t make the same mistake and waste money on this unless you do t care if you see the entire picture, spreadsheet, etc\n', '\n  I use this as a second monitor with my laptop so I may do mult-screen tasks and work with multiple windows in MS Word. I have it turned on and off using Alexa (and a supplemental WiFi power switch). So it can be easily powered on and off by switches other than the one on the monitor. I use the HDMI connection.\n', ""\n  Great monitor. Have been using it almost every day for about 3-4 months. I never had any problems with it, everything is straight forward.I cannot say anything about its stand, because I never used it, since I installed it on my monitor mount.A small thing that I noticed is that, when installing it on my monitor mount, I could tell that it's got little frame and screen protection. I mean I felt like if I dropped the monitor on the floor, it would crack open, which I never noticed on any other monitors I used before. But monitors are not made to be dropped on the ground, so this is definitely not a reason not to buy this monitor. If you are someone that can be careful and knows how to use hands properly, you will never have any problems with this monitor :-)\n"", '\n  for the most part i am satisfied with the quality of the picture, but why must monitors always drive u insane with a blinking light when they go on standby? i just don’t understand how that could be a valued feature, and the blinking light for this monitor is really bright and really annoying.\n', ""\n  This is a pretty meh monitor. It is a third monitor in my setup (web browsing, work processing, etc) so it is fine - but the angle of view isn't super great; I find there is a lot of bleed/glow from high contrast images/text and the colour is way off out of the box (I have a hardware colour calibration that I used). So if you are thinking of this for your main monitor I would encourage you to look elsewhere. If it is a nice-to-have-extra-real-estate sort of thing it is probably fine, but not great. It was inexpensive when I purchased it so I can't complain too much but in retrospect I should have paid a bit more and bought a better monitor.\n"", ""\n  Pas 6 mois d'utilisation et elle est déjà défectueuse...vraiment déçu...bienvenue la garantie!\n"", ""\n  Less than a month after support has ended it has a dead pixel, It would be less obnoxious if it wasn't beside a six year old samsung that has zero dead pixels, oh well.\n"", '\n  Good quality\n', '\n  Llevo 3 años con el, aun funciona cómo la primera vez que lo prendí.\n']"
