This monitor has excellent color and clarity. I would have given it 5 stars except that all of the controls have been morphed into one button which was then placed on the back of the monitor. What numbskull thought that was a good idea?  I don't buy electronic equipment in order to improve my manual dexterity.

The colors are vivid and clear and being able to replace my dated (also Samsung) monitors with a bigger screen in a smaller footprint was a bonus for me. Great price as well.\n', ""\n  Okay, first off, this monitor is way more than worth it for the price. It's a great size, bezels are very thin and the display is almost perfect, for me. I realized when I did the black screen test, there was some bleeding. It was only very noticeable in the bottom left corner, so that's a drawback. I get it though, its 149.99 so I almost forgive it. Two things I wish it had was an aux port as well as built in speakers, and possibly a mic port, but I dont really mind since my pc is right next to me. Over all, I'd give this a solid 4.6/10. Good job Samsung.\n"", '\n  Great price for a well made monitor. Product is just the right size and has a nice sleek look. Has both VGA and HDMI and no speakers of course.

Its not rich in color. My daughter has trouble seeing her google classroom work.\n"", ""\n  Easy set-up, arrived super fast, good picture quality.  I have two issues with this monitor:1. Major issue - monitor is very wobbly on it's own stand.  Screws are tight, but the actual neck and base of the stand itself has far too much flex (weak, thin plastic) and it wobbles back and forth when I type.  Super distracting, and I'll need to figure out a solution before it drives me crazy.  Likely will need a separate desk-mounted stand which was unanticipated.2. No height adjustment - again, if it's not at your eye level when you set it up on your desk, you'll likely want to buy a stand to raise the height.\n"", ""\n  Previously owned a LS27F350 which sadly only lasted 2 1/2 years before vertical lines began appearing.  That screen was using a PLS panel which is Samsungs version of IPS.  The LS27F350 had a bright image with poppy colours and decent contrast ratio.I found an article from March 2020 on the Verge talking about Samsung display getting out of the LCD Business.Its possible this newer model is using an IPS panel from another manufacturer which could explain the dull picture quality in comparison to the older model.  This is not uncommon, I have an HP Monitor which uses an LG IPS Panel and I've seen some LG Monitors using AUO IPS Panels.  I also found the image to be quite blue in hue compared to older model.The Vesa mounts are improved from the previous model, its higher up and the neck can be removed.\n"", '\n  Needed it for business during COVID as I worked predominantly in larger spreadsheets and PowerPoints (and now for school this upcoming semester as I have gotten accustomed to reaping the benefits of working on a larger screen!). Value for price is definitely here. Would buy another one if I needed a second display.\n', ""\n  I used a 21.5 inch Samsung monitor I got from Costco for around 8 years. I've gotten so used to using the new thin bezel displays at work that I thought it's time for an upgrade. I got a flexible arm vesa mount stand and 2 of these 24 inch monitors.Picture quality is okay. Viewing angles are not the best. The thin bezel is nice. But for the price, I can't complain. 1080p at 24 inches is starting to look a little blurry compared to displays nowadays.Controls interface is okay. The older Samsung model I had had capacitive buttons which were nice. This model has a joystick button on the back of the display, similar to LG TVs. I understand that they had to go this route due to the thin bezels and no room to have the buttons be at the front. It works okay but it's an extra button press to then it off.I/O looks like HDMI and VGA, no display port. Okay for my purposes. No complaints here.I don't think it comes with speakers but I've had external speakers for years now so I don't mind at all. If anything, I prefer the monitor not to have them since it would cost more and weigh more too.The power supply is nice because the power supply block is connected to the outlet by a regular power cord so that it doesn't use up more than one plug on a power bar. This is good design.Overall, if you can find it on sale, it's very good value. I got 2 and I'm happy with them. Not the best displays I've seen but a steal at this price.\n"", '\n  I use it with my macbook veryGood picture quality has a gamingMode and movie mode.The only thing is the base is notAdjustable\n']"

Does it have superb color and contrast? No. Does it boast the best refresh rate on the market? No. But if you're tight on money, this thing looks and preforms great for the money. It has a Matte screen which does a great job at eliminating glare. The chassis it's enclosed within is absolutely stunning. It features a VGA and and HDMI port. The screen automatically detects signals and turns on when a source is turned on. When the selected source turns off it quickly scans and switches to any other sources. If no connections are available it goes into standby automatically. The power chord is a good 6 or more feet and easy to wrap with half of it being very thin wire. The ON LED is not distracting or too bright. When it's off it looks like a borderless monitor. And unlike what other people say it does have tilt, just not forward or left to right. It stands up straight or leans back. Unfortunately it doesn't have VESA mount holes, but under 100 you can't be that serious about your monitor setup. Small text has some problems fully rendering when using VGA so I recommend using HDMI. If you use the Windows 10 settings to configure how text is displayed though it fixes this, but not all will know how to do that. It doesn't have speaker, and I am thankful that most monitors don't. This monitor has A LOT of settings for gaming, night use, color adjustments, and general settings and all can be saved into 3 different gaming profiles. You can even change what settings appear in the quick menu. When u press any of the menu buttons, the menu pops up and clearly illustrates all the buttons. This monitors menus are super easy to understand and navigate and that's a rarity in its own. Also worth noting; it can display crosshairs and display the monitors current refresh rate. It also packs FreeSync for AMD graphics card users. If you only have DVI, you can get DVI to HDMI chords as long as your computer's video out supports it. The base and monitor couple together with one screw that features a hand flap so you don't need a screw diver if you don't want to use one. It is decently sturdy and the screen doesn't distort even when pressed on with strong pressure. The base is quite large, but wont be a problem for most. I haven't noticed any screen delay compared to my 300 dollar 1ms response time monitor (and I'm pretty picky). It's contrast is a little flat in some scenarios but appears much more dynamic in games, especially with some tweaking. With that said, I like that it looks flat when working on documents because it makes it much easier to focus.All in all, this monitor is filled with a good balance of features and looks like a very solid 1080p 75Hz IPS screen for any monitor under $160, let alone the $80 I paid. If you don't absolutely need a better refresh rate and aren't planning on spending more than 200 dollars then I would say just buy this monitor. It's durable, feature packed, and looks fantastic in all use-case scenarios. I'd give it 1000 stars if I could.\n"", ""\n  I've seen many other reviews saying this monitor does not tilt, but it in fact does. I'm guessing people didn't take a close enough look at the hinge mechanism in the base, which attaches to the main display and allows for backwards tilt of approximately 15 degrees. The monitor is very light, thin, has small bezels, and produces reasonably good colors. It doesn't have a vesa mount, but I knew that before purchasing it, and wasn't planning to mount it. For $89, it is a great value.\n"", ""\n  Aside from my computer and PS4, this is probably one of the best things I've ever purchased. I use it every single day without error and everything always looks amazing. I'm a broke college kid and really needed something sufficient for PS4, homework, movies, everything really. I was torn between this and the HP pavilion and I have no regrets from picking this one! The screen is definitely big enough (perfect for having multiple pages open for homework) and is insanely vibrant and good quality for the price. I have absolutely no complaints, and even with a horrible $2 thunderbolt to HDMI cable for my Mac, it still looks absolutely amazing.\n"", '\n  I just got this monitor few days ago and setting up literally took a minute. Colors are so vibrant and bright. Darks are good and brights are rich.  I work in a IT field and I’ve seen and used a lot of monitors, this is by far the best I’ve used till date. I’ve only used vga and it’s already better than using hdmi in most of the monitors. I can only imagine what it would be after using with an hdmi cable. Its a steal for the price I got.\n', ""\n  I am somewhat satisfied with my purchase. The price was great, and looks great too. Easy to assemble. Came with vga and power cord. Colors look amazing, no annoying power indicator lights. The options menu is very easy to navigate. I didn't want to do this, but I had to dock a star as it lacked the ability to tilt. It's at a permanent position so I'm gonna have to stack an extra book below to go the position I want. Otherwise, 10/10\n"", ""\n  Read over the reviews at least 10 times weighing the pros and cons but I decided to go for it and I'm glad that I did! Like others stated, it took maybe 5-6 minutes to unpack and get up and running. I wanted a larger screen to use when I work from home as my 10 inch laptop keeps me squinting and bending over. The monitor is SUPER lightweight and very sleek. It comes with the VGA cord but no HDMI cord, luckily I have several laying around the house. I did have to prop it up a bit in the front since there is no tilt option, but that wasn't a deal breaker for me. I use this for basic internet and word processing, no gaming or watching movies and it's been working great for me!\n"", '\n  This is a basic, no frills, monitor with a beautiful picture & well deserved reputation for lasting a long time.  No built in speaker, get a different model if that is what you want.  Not for the novice, as the only usable instruction is ""turn off computer before installing"".  There are 5 buttons on the bottom edge of the monitor, but pictograms are useless.  But, don\'t worry; after you make all connections & power up the computer & monitor, the monitor checks connections & automatically picks the correct settings for you.  If you have an HDMI connection on your computer (preferably on the back panel), use that instead of the VGA cable to get the best quality picture.  (You must supply the cable.)\n', ""\n  You can't really expect much from a monitor that is less than $100, but this is a great monitor for everyday use. The only reason I give it 4 our of 5 stars is because there is no way to mount this on a wall or versa mount. Other than that, great clarity, color and size for the price point. I will be finding a way to mount this on my versa mount as looking down on a monitor is not conducive to prolonged use.\n"", ""\n  This monitor really knocked my socks off!  I was expecting just another monitor, like my old one.  I needed a new one for my wife so I grabbed this.  It isn't kidding when they say it is thin.  It's very light weight, which doesn't matter to me much.  The colour quality is top notch and response is perfect, no blurriness or anything.  But what surprised me is that I will sometimes watch videos on it, and when I do, I will move to a livingroom chair I have in the corner to watch it which sits lower.  With my old monitor that would make the video much darker and I would have to adjust it so that the monitor was facing almost directly at me to get a good image.  With this one, I sat down and the image was just fine without even turning it or angling it down or anything!!!  It didn't get darker, very minimal glare on it.  The black is nice and black like it should be (with some nice options in the monitor settings to adjust the blackness).  It has a ton of settings for the monitor.  The refresh rate of 75 is nice.  I'm a casual gamer and it is perfect for that, the colours in my game really looked nice.  I can't say enough about this, I was FINALLY pleasantly surprised (as opposed to so much I have purchased that didn't work).  Well worth the money by far!\n"", '\n  relación calidad-precio exacta, pagas por lo que tiene este monitor, lastimosamente es un monitor de 6bits + frc no es de 8 bits verdaderos, esto sirve para gaming por la respuesta tan rápida que tiene pero no para ver colores buenos, en realidad no tiene buenos colores, en general se ven deslavados pero no puedo pedir mas por este precio tan bajo. en cuanto ángulos de visión... tienes que estar directo a el, no puedes verlo de ningún lado porque veras el sangrado de luz de fondo o los colores aun mas deslavados, tiene muy buen brillo, de echo te lastima si lo pones al máximo en la noche, es extremadamente brillante. por default mi tarjeta nvidia lo detecta como un monitor de 75hz, escondiendo los otros modos de 60 hz 50 hz 30hz 25hz 24 hz 23.7 hz. tiene buena nitidez y tiene buenos negros pero repito existe el sangrado de luz de fondo aunque no sea tan severo y repito es bueno para gaming no para colores vivos o ver películas con colores vibrantes y bonitos.

Probably not. Do I use it fine? Of course. If you want perfect brightness distribution then go buy another monitor.

I use it to play games and have no complaints.I've never had a higher refresh rate than 60Hz but I personally wouldn't spend too much more on any higher because I find games are playable at this refresh rate and FPS it provides. Would I spend more money on a higher resolution and higher refresh rate eventually? Maybe. But for now, this works great.Buy this monitor if you're not too serious about insane detail.\n"", '\n  Compré este monitor por el simple hecho de que era un 1080p 75hz de Acer.

I didn\'t need it to ""do"" much, I just needed a little extra desktop real estate.This shipped with a dead pixel. I could live with that if that was the only thing wrong with it. Eye strain was immediate upon viewing the monitor. Light leak around the edges is terrible. The picture quality is awful at both 60 and 75 Hz.Text appeared jagged. Images were washed out. I connected to my PS4 and the results were equally disappointing. Do not purchase if you are thinking about using this as a gaming monitor. Do no purchase this if you are thinking about ANY monitor.I was using this as a \'trial\' monitor for other Sceptre monitors.

The headphone jack is garbage but fortunately, it\'s not a deal-breaker because the monitor sound is good. It\'s really only 18"" and they may leave it at your door in the product box so all your neighbors and passerbys can see you bought a monitor. Read full review for details.So I\'ve been shopping around for a couple of weeks now trying to put together a decent little gaming computer and when I finally got around to shopping for the monitor... here\'s this lovely monitor for only $88.... can\'t be right. I click and read through the specs....this can\'t be right. Then I look through the reviews... about 300/4000 (4/11/2020) reviews were 1 stars with sound issues, screen issues, power cord issues, one-and-done then never coming back on, and just plain crappy craftsmanship.That being said... the numbers.... 300/4000 are what convinced me to at least give it a try... I mean for $88 bucks and with amazon return/refund policy the worst that would happen is that I get a dud and I just don\'t repurchase the monitor and I find a  better one. So I ordered it.PROS(ish)I received it today.. plugged it in... and held my breath as pressed the power button. IT LIVES! There\'s one big complaint/ 1-star rating worry crushed.I hook it up to my laptop... I jump over to Youtube to test the sound... IT SINGS! Another hurdle/ 1-star  rating worry crushed.I then unplug everything and properly set it up ( I didn\'t set up the stand or other bits because I didn\'t want to have to re-wrap and pack if I got a dud)... I set up the stand and place it on my desk with my other things and plug it up again... IT COMES BACK TO LIFE!I put in my copy of Avatar to test the 1080p they boast about for the monitor and IT LOOKS GORGEOUS!CONS So now most of my biggest 1-star worries are crushed however there are 3 non-deal-breakers that I have with the monitor.It has an audio jack for headphones but the sound is so grainy and there\'s a lot of noise. I tried several different headphones and they all sound like garbage unless you turn it down to lower volume where you can\'t hear the noise. SO while the sound from the monitor is great the sound for headphones is garbage.Next, 20"" they say? I don\'t want to make a ""boys can measure joke"" but... it\'s really only 18""... so if you\'re really looking for those extra 2"" they aren\'t there.Lastly, is a shipping issue... the box they ship it in is the product box, like fresh off the shelf at a store. Guys, you\'re sending this to someones house/apartment?! Thankfully I was home when it was delivered and I got an email from Amazon letting me know my delivery was close by BUT what is I hadn\'t been home? Someone could have easily seen exactly what I ordered and taken from my porch. While I understand that Amazon/Whoever-sold-it is not responsible for porch theft ... you could at least make it more discreet and lessen the chance of someone wanting to steal it.Thanks and ""May the odds be ever in your favor""\n', '\n  A very good value. I just needed a 20"" monitor to replace one that had gone bad on a two-monitor system-I needed to match the size so that was important. I hadn\'t heard of Sceptre, but the reviews were positive, so I ordered one. It arrived in two days, well packaged and padded. I was impressed that a screwdriver and two different connector cables were included with the purchase. Assembly was easy and intuitive. Plugged it in and connected to my computer and it booted right up. I\'ve used it for one day and have been quite pleased. I imagine if it was side by side with a gaming display I might notice some quality disparities, but for my purposes this works extremely well. It takes up less space on my desk than the previous monitor while maintaining the same display area.\n', '\n  What a waste of money!

This is a matte which is more suitable office work. The matte finish helps to offset office lighting and the sun from reflecting on the screen. I still enjoy watching a video on this monitor and gaming is fine. I\'m not implying otherwise.Pros:1- The screen is BRIGHT! Turn it down. I prefer a monitor that you have to turn down brightness rather than the other way around!2- It\'s very lightweight and easy to move around.3- Even after being on for a while it does not get very warm.4- I like the way the menu is set up and the physical on/off button has a light touch so you don\'t to ""gorilla"" it.Cons:1- So the I mentioned I like the matte screen and yet LG pulled a typical LG-ish move. The bezel around the screen is SHINY plastic. So what you may say? If you are looking at a dark video for example, that shiny plastic reflects whatever light is around so the it looks like there\'s led light embedded in the bezel frame! LOL...2- Again, another typical LG-ish move; both the video cable AND the power cable are too short. Unless of course you have the monitor sitting right next to your PC. Even then, the power cable is a 3 prong unit. It\'s kind of like, come on LG, you couldn\'t add another 12 to the length? Lame-O. I found a good deal here on Amazon for a longer cable and I moved my UPS protector to compensate for the short power cable length.3- The base is made of plastic. No big deal but you have to be careful when changing the angle of your screen. Don\'t gorilla it.To finish up; none of the Cons are deal-breakers. This is a nice monitor for the price and I\'m very happy with it. If LG were to charge another $15 retail and fix the details I mentioned above it would still be a nice value.\n', '\n  Monitors were visibly broken.

Great for my home office.+ Picture quality and color are really nice+ Minimal glare, even in the sun+ Plug and play, easy set upCons:- The display was deteriorated significantly by interference when using a VGA adapter to connect to my laptop. The severity of this rendered the screen largely useless. Replacing this connection with an HDMI cable totally fixed the problem, and the display now looks excellent. This, however, is problematic because only a VGA cable is included in the box, it would be nice if an HDMI was included.- The height of the stand is fixed, you can not adjust it upwards or downwards.\n', ""\n  I already have one LG monitor that I use as my primary display and it has been perfect for me. So, of course, I bought another LG (a cheaper one no less) to use as my secondary monitor. Welp, this one didn't fair so well. I received the monitor, set it up, plugged it in...no light indicator. So weird! I immediately called LG to find out if I had the correct AC Adapter and they informed me that the one I had was not correct. I thought, cool, I'll get a new one through Amazon and be on my way!The new AC adapter arrived today...still dead. Ugh, very frustrating.

I never had any problems with it, everything is straight forward.I cannot say anything about its stand, because I never used it, since I installed it on my monitor mount.A small thing that I noticed is that, when installing it on my monitor mount, I could tell that it's got little frame and screen protection. I mean I felt like if I dropped the monitor on the floor, it would crack open, which I never noticed on any other monitors I used before. But monitors are not made to be dropped on the ground, so this is definitely not a reason not to buy this monitor. If you are someone that can be careful and knows how to use hands properly, you will never have any problems with this monitor :-)\n"", '\n  for the most part i am satisfied with the quality of the picture, but why must monitors always drive u insane with a blinking light when they go on standby? i just don’t understand how that could be a valued feature, and the blinking light for this monitor is really bright and really annoying.\n', ""\n  This is a pretty meh monitor. It is a third monitor in my setup (web browsing, work processing, etc) so it is fine - but the angle of view isn't super great; I find there is a lot of bleed/glow from high contrast images/text and the colour is way off out of the box (I have a hardware colour calibration that I used). So if you are thinking of this for your main monitor I would encourage you to look elsewhere. If it is a nice-to-have-extra-real-estate sort of thing it is probably fine, but not great. It was inexpensive when I purchased it so I can't complain too much but in retrospect I should have paid a bit more and bought a better monitor.\n"", ""\n  Pas 6 mois d'utilisation et elle est déjà défectueuse...vraiment déçu...bienvenue la garantie!\n"", ""\n  Less than a month after support has ended it has a dead pixel, It would be less obnoxious if it wasn't beside a six year old samsung that has zero dead pixels, oh well.\n"", '\n  Good quality\n', '\n  Llevo 3 años con el, aun funciona cómo la primera vez que lo prendí.\n']"

Here\'s the issues with the LG software:#1) It doesn\'t split the monitor as if you had a dual monitor display.  Let me explain, if you had two monitors you can full-screen apps and three-finger swipe to other full-screened apps.  Since LG software creates two ""sections"" rather than two ""monitors"", you can\'t full-screen apps in split mode... if you do full-screen it spans the entire monitor.#2) Apps don\'t stay in the same virtual monitor when using split screen.  It\'s super annoying when side-by-side apps (e.g. composing an email on one and looking at notes on the other) that apps randomly switch which side they are on when moving between apps.  I spend half my day putting apps back where I want them.Besides that, really nice monitor.\n', '\n  The picture is excellent, but the refresh rate is only 60 Hz.

I'm sure it's also a great gaming monitor. However, I would like to clear up some confusion that seems to be out there about the 2 USB 3.0 ports on the back of the monitor. I wanted to install LED lights that plug into a USB port, but, alas, no lights! I tried the 2nd port and, again, same thing. I called LG support about this and they advised that you can only get power from the USB 3.0 ports if you have the USB-C port connected to your computer. THEN the USB 3.0 ports come alive. So I tested this and, sure enough, the USB 3.0 ports provided poer tp the LEDs once the USB-C port was connected to the computer. A minor inconvenience to run the USB-C cable through the wall to keep that wireless appearance, but well worth it. I also love the windows snap software this monitor comes with. It helps me work so much faster when I can post more windows, especially with the Win 10 multiple desktop feature. I love that! Overall, very pleased and glad to be taking the leap from the old dual 19 inch square monitor setup to this new creature comfort.\n"", '\n  Powering this awesome display from a 2017 13"" MBP and I am very impressed by the picture quality and features. Having a single USB-C cable charge the computer and provide display output is a game changer. I\'m not a designer or display expert, but find that the resolution and quality are both more than adequate for my workflow (mostly email, Excel, presentations, video calls, etc.)A few pro tips based using the monitor for several days: (1) For Mac, download a utility like Magnet or LG\'s own OnScreen Controls software to take advantage of the massive display and to help with window management. (2) There are no speakers built in, so would recommend investing in a pair of speakers alongside this display. I picked up a cheap set of Creative USB speakers for $20 that are more than fine. (3) With several USB-A devices, I was hoping a USB hub attached to one of the 2 ports on the back would help power everything, but I was getting a power draw error. I now just run everything that doesn\'t need to interface with the computer to the hub plugged in to a power outlet.\n', '\n  This is the perfect monitor for folks who need lots of windows open at once and have a USB-C system.  It works great with a 15"" MacBook Pro.  I have a small USB hub connected to one of the 2 ports on the monitor for connecting the webcam, and desk lamp.  I have a Ethernet to USB 3.0 adapter connected to the other one for network access.  Everything connects to the MacBook Pro over the single USB-C cable without an issue.Deducted points for gaming as 1) Monitor is only 60hz, 2) Monitor doesn\'t do any frame syncing (g sync or free sync) 3) most competitive games don\'t support 21:9 aspect ratio.  If you are not a gamer, none of this will affect you.  This is not a monitor targeting gamers.\n', '\n  This was my first purchase of an ultra-wide monitor. the LG 34"" screen works great for my needs of online instruction and daily use. The extra screen size allows for multiple windows to display various programs are browsers. Plenty of brightness. Not one dead pixel! My only complaint was the VESA compliant stand that I purchased wouldn\'t mount as manufactured so had to alter the mounting slightly with longer screws and washers. Been using for about 2 months and really like it.\n', '\n  Out of the box was defective. Half of the display was very dark. Call LG and had an excellent experience with them. They confirmed it was a defect an gave me a case number to call Amazon and have it replaced. I called Amazon and to my surprise a call that should have taken 2 or 3 min, took about 15 min. I had just gotten the monitor opened and it doesn\'t work and I have a case number from LG confirming it. Amazon should have just said ""No worries, the replacement is on its way""....They instead asked me if I wanted to fix it (Of course NOT) Then they had to called LG. Finally transfered me to someone else to mail another monitor.I got the new monitor in two days (very fast) and it is amazing. I\'m fascinated with it. I will recommend it to anyone.\n', ""\n  This monitor is beautiful.  Once you move into ultrawide, you can't go back to the dual monitor setup. I purchased this monitor for productivity use - so excel, browsing, programming etc.Pros:VESA mount. I was able to use my old monitor arm with this monitorThe real estate is really nice.Type C input that provides 60W power - so basically I am able to plug my Dell work when I am working and then later to my MacBook pro 2016 after work with one cable.Cons:- Expensive especially relative to the straight version of this monitor- NO Picture in Picture or Dual controller: Trading my dual monitor for this single monitor, I was expecting to still be able to use it like dual monitor i.e. view two input sources simultaneously but it is not possible with this version. I will be reaching out to LG to find out if I am missing something or what version supports this functionality.- no inbuilt speaker.- no ethernet port so I have to plug and unplug ethernet cable to my laptop. My 60 dollar Amazon dock can do this. I see no reason why a 700 bucks monitor cannot do it.- The Dual software is full of serious bugs. I constantly have issues with it on both my Mac and PC. On Mac, it keeps opening safari every time I try to switch between screens. On my PC, it works like 80% of the time, the other 20% is seriously frustrating that I considered looking for alternative screen splitting software.Overall, I think it is a great monitor. I am not sure if I will be keeping it. I might return it and wait for the monitor to go on sale as I can't get past the lack of all the above-stated features at this price point. For cheaper price, I will consider keeping this monitor.\n"", '\n  Para ser un monitor de gama media es excelente. El diseño y la construcción son muy buenos, y es muy cómodo trabajar en él por el gran tamaño.La imagen es suficientemente buena para uso común, pero definitivamente no para uso profesional de edición de fotografía o video:La nitidez es muy buena, y los colores son agradables. Sin embargo, la gradiente de negro a blanco no es consistente, y si se aumenta el contraste o se sube el brillo, rápidamente se pierde mucho rango dinámico, a pesar de ser HDR. También a pesar de tener 99% de sRGB, los colores están un poco desviados, principalmente los negros son algo rojizos, y no hay muchas opciones de ajustar manualmente el color. Además, por alguna razón al conectar el monitor por USB-C, algunos ajustes se desactivan, y solamente se pueden activar con conexión HDMI. Al comparar la imagen con la del Retina Display de una MacBook Pro de 15"", la imagen de este monitor es claramente inferior tanto en color como en rango dinámico, contraste y nitidez.También a pesar de que el monitor puede cargar la computadora y transmitir imagen simultáneamente por el mismo cable USB-C, esto limita el rendimiento de la computadora, si planeas hacer uso intensivo que requiera muchos recursos del CPU, lo ideal es conectar la computadora a la corriente con su cargador, además del USB-C al monitor.Sin embargo, en este rango de precio no creo que haya un mejor monitor de 34"", ofrece muchas más ventajas que desventajas.\n', ""\n  Beautiful display, brilliant colors in HDR mode... but it broke after 5 months.

I do photoshop/ web work and there was no way I could use this.  I have another LG 34"" colour curved ultra wide and thought this one would be much better, but it was awful.  It gave us both headaches to use and looked nothing like my other LG.  Also this monitor shipped with no protective film on the screen like my other one did and we noticed a major scratch on the screen.

I decided a few days ago that I wanted to buy a 27"" monitor and a curved screen seemed cool, so I went for a \'renewed\' (huge mistake) Samsung curved screen 27"" monitor. When I opened the box, I was dismayed to see that some of the materials were either missing or out of the bag. The stand was fairly easy to assemble, and soon I had the unit attached to my Mac Pro Tower system running OS X Mojave. From the get-go the experience went down-hill, as the picture just wasn\'t that bright or sharp. After calibration, it only looked a little better, but I could live with it. But then I noticed the elephant in the room! There was a nasty light-leak coming in at the bottom corner of the right side of the screen. In fact it looked more like a damaged panel than a light-leak. So now I\'m angry and I call Amazon who, after talking to two reps, refunded my money to a gift-card, where after receiving (2 hours) I immediately started looking into another monitor. I couldn\'t really afford anything over $200.00, so the Spectre caught my eye. Although the reviews were mostly great on Amazon, I also saw some glowing reviews on some high-tech websites, so the 27"" Spectre was ordered and it arrived about two hours ago. This is my experience:1. Amazon had it double-boxed and carefully packed. (The Samsung was NOT double-boxed)2. The monitor sits inside its own colorful box, also carefully packed.3. Accessories include labeled packages of screws, power-brick and cable + HDMI cable and Booklet.4. There is also a cool magnetic screw-driver and cable management attachments. (Very nice!)5. It took less than three minutes to get everything attached. Unlike some reviewers, I found the stand easy to attach.6. The protective film was easy to peel off.7. Build quality is excellent, and this does not feel or look cheap.8. The inputs are simple: VGA, HDMI and Power-Plug.9. Hooked it up to my Mac and the picture came on without a hitch.10. Happily there were no pixels burnt out and no light-leaks or bleeds whatsoever.11. The picture looked good, but not especially bright.12. Once I figured out how to navigate the big configuration menu and make some adjustments, the monitor came alive with a sharp, bright and crisp display.13. Text looks good; MUCH better than the Samsung did.14. Others have complained that is  not an edgeless display panel. I find that issue to not be an issue at al, as it is very close to that reality. The rim is very small; barely noticeable ... not to me anyway!Final Thoughts: This is a wonderful monitor and Sceptre did it right! I am extremely happy with this purchase, and I sure hope that over the next several months, I remain a happy camper!\n', ""\n  I wasn't expecting the best quality product but needed to replace my Samsung monitor that unexpectedly stopped working after 5+ years. This product's price is great and was the main factor for purchase in the first place.Unfortunately, the picture quality is not as sharp and clear as i need it to be and the volume of the built-in speakers is really low. It was set-up in a room facing a street so there's always a faint hum of street noise that the sound has to overcome. The volume MIGHT sound louder in a room that is totally quiet.The picture quality is similar to that of an analog screen and the speakers make it sound as if people are mumbling so you have to really concentrate to try and make out what is being said.Fortunately, i have external speakers so the low volume was less of an issue than the poor picture quality.I would have been willing to keep the unit if the picture was even half way decent but the edges of images and text are fuzzy and the overall look of images and text are dull (i.e. as if there was a film or screen on the monitor that prevents colors from being vibrant). This was even AFTER modifying the brightness, contrast and sharpness levels.I HAVE to return the unit and will probably replace it with another Samsung product which is at least $75 to $100 more than this item. Such a bummer but i guess you get what you pay for.If you spend at least 2+ hours a day on your computer, viewing more videos than reading text or articles then this is NOT the monitor for you.\n"", '\n  I was real sceptical about these monitors because they were so inexpensive.

Some slight PC gaming as well as for work purposes. As soon as I plugged this monitor in it looked fantastic. It is bright and the curve adds a little something to the experience. But I have waited to review this purchase because everything is great out of the box. It has been about a month now and I still love this monitor. Color and pictures are still very crisp. Very happy with my purchase.\n', '\n  After trying to pick the pull tab I finally got it start pulling the protective packaging off and the screen shatters!!!!\n', '\n  The best monitor I ever had so far. I had a 27 curved one from samsung and this one now is waaaaaay better. I cannot even compare! Colors are perfect and vivid! Really happy and satisfied\n', '\n  Working from home now I needed a larger screen than my 13"" laptop provides. I checked out a number of models and this covered all the bases. It\'s got a great picture, fast refresh and a very reasonable price. My only complaint is that the power cord is short. I have the monitor on my dining room table and the cord barely reaches the floor. It should have been 10 feet long rather than 5 feet. It\'s an annoyance but for a few pennies more this monitor would have been outstandingly perfect.\n', '\n  NO ME PARECE QUE EN LA OFERTA DE BUEN FIN ESTE MAS ALTO EL PRECIO, INCLUSO ME IBA A COMPRAR OTRO EL VIERNES PASADO SI MAL NO RECUERDO EL PRECIO ANDABA SOBRE LOS 4,200, PERO ME ESPERE PENSANDO QUE ESTARIA A UN MEJOR PRECIO, SORPRESA QUE ME LLEVE AL VER QUE ANDA SOBRE LOS 5,200\n', '\n  bonjour belle achat pour le prix , le son est mediocre prévoir des haut- parleurs et l écran n est pas pleine il y a une petite bordure c est les 2 seuls points négatifs, belle image facile a ajustémerci je vous la recommande\n']"

Does it have superb color and contrast? No. Does it boast the best refresh rate on the market? No. But if you're tight on money, this thing looks and preforms great for the money. It has a Matte screen which does a great job at eliminating glare. The chassis it's enclosed within is absolutely stunning. It features a VGA and and HDMI port. The screen automatically detects signals and turns on when a source is turned on. When the selected source turns off it quickly scans and switches to any other sources. If no connections are available it goes into standby automatically. The power chord is a good 6 or more feet and easy to wrap with half of it being very thin wire. The ON LED is not distracting or too bright. When it's off it looks like a borderless monitor. And unlike what other people say it does have tilt, just not forward or left to right. It stands up straight or leans back. Unfortunately it doesn't have VESA mount holes, but under 100 you can't be that serious about your monitor setup. Small text has some problems fully rendering when using VGA so I recommend using HDMI. If you use the Windows 10 settings to configure how text is displayed though it fixes this, but not all will know how to do that. It doesn't have speaker, and I am thankful that most monitors don't. This monitor has A LOT of settings for gaming, night use, color adjustments, and general settings and all can be saved into 3 different gaming profiles. You can even change what settings appear in the quick menu. When u press any of the menu buttons, the menu pops up and clearly illustrates all the buttons. This monitors menus are super easy to understand and navigate and that's a rarity in its own. Also worth noting; it can display crosshairs and display the monitors current refresh rate. It also packs FreeSync for AMD graphics card users. If you only have DVI, you can get DVI to HDMI chords as long as your computer's video out supports it. The base and monitor couple together with one screw that features a hand flap so you don't need a screw diver if you don't want to use one. It is decently sturdy and the screen doesn't distort even when pressed on with strong pressure. The base is quite large, but wont be a problem for most. I haven't noticed any screen delay compared to my 300 dollar 1ms response time monitor (and I'm pretty picky). It's contrast is a little flat in some scenarios but appears much more dynamic in games, especially with some tweaking. With that said, I like that it looks flat when working on documents because it makes it much easier to focus.All in all, this monitor is filled with a good balance of features and looks like a very solid 1080p 75Hz IPS screen for any monitor under $160, let alone the $80 I paid. If you don't absolutely need a better refresh rate and aren't planning on spending more than 200 dollars then I would say just buy this monitor. It's durable, feature packed, and looks fantastic in all use-case scenarios. I'd give it 1000 stars if I could.\n"", ""\n  I've seen many other reviews saying this monitor does not tilt, but it in fact does. I'm guessing people didn't take a close enough look at the hinge mechanism in the base, which attaches to the main display and allows for backwards tilt of approximately 15 degrees. The monitor is very light, thin, has small bezels, and produces reasonably good colors. It doesn't have a vesa mount, but I knew that before purchasing it, and wasn't planning to mount it. For $89, it is a great value.\n"", ""\n  Aside from my computer and PS4, this is probably one of the best things I've ever purchased. I use it every single day without error and everything always looks amazing. I'm a broke college kid and really needed something sufficient for PS4, homework, movies, everything really. I was torn between this and the HP pavilion and I have no regrets from picking this one! The screen is definitely big enough (perfect for having multiple pages open for homework) and is insanely vibrant and good quality for the price. I have absolutely no complaints, and even with a horrible $2 thunderbolt to HDMI cable for my Mac, it still looks absolutely amazing.\n"", '\n  I just got this monitor few days ago and setting up literally took a minute. Colors are so vibrant and bright. Darks are good and brights are rich.  I work in a IT field and I’ve seen and used a lot of monitors, this is by far the best I’ve used till date. I’ve only used vga and it’s already better than using hdmi in most of the monitors. I can only imagine what it would be after using with an hdmi cable. Its a steal for the price I got.\n', ""\n  I am somewhat satisfied with my purchase. The price was great, and looks great too. Easy to assemble. Came with vga and power cord. Colors look amazing, no annoying power indicator lights. The options menu is very easy to navigate. I didn't want to do this, but I had to dock a star as it lacked the ability to tilt. It's at a permanent position so I'm gonna have to stack an extra book below to go the position I want. Otherwise, 10/10\n"", ""\n  Read over the reviews at least 10 times weighing the pros and cons but I decided to go for it and I'm glad that I did! Like others stated, it took maybe 5-6 minutes to unpack and get up and running. I wanted a larger screen to use when I work from home as my 10 inch laptop keeps me squinting and bending over. The monitor is SUPER lightweight and very sleek. It comes with the VGA cord but no HDMI cord, luckily I have several laying around the house. I did have to prop it up a bit in the front since there is no tilt option, but that wasn't a deal breaker for me. I use this for basic internet and word processing, no gaming or watching movies and it's been working great for me!\n"", '\n  This is a basic, no frills, monitor with a beautiful picture & well deserved reputation for lasting a long time.  No built in speaker, get a different model if that is what you want.  Not for the novice, as the only usable instruction is ""turn off computer before installing"".  There are 5 buttons on the bottom edge of the monitor, but pictograms are useless.  But, don\'t worry; after you make all connections & power up the computer & monitor, the monitor checks connections & automatically picks the correct settings for you.  If you have an HDMI connection on your computer (preferably on the back panel), use that instead of the VGA cable to get the best quality picture.  (You must supply the cable.)\n', ""\n  You can't really expect much from a monitor that is less than $100, but this is a great monitor for everyday use. The only reason I give it 4 our of 5 stars is because there is no way to mount this on a wall or versa mount. Other than that, great clarity, color and size for the price point. I will be finding a way to mount this on my versa mount as looking down on a monitor is not conducive to prolonged use.\n"", ""\n  This monitor really knocked my socks off!  I was expecting just another monitor, like my old one.  I needed a new one for my wife so I grabbed this.  It isn't kidding when they say it is thin.  It's very light weight, which doesn't matter to me much.  The colour quality is top notch and response is perfect, no blurriness or anything.  But what surprised me is that I will sometimes watch videos on it, and when I do, I will move to a livingroom chair I have in the corner to watch it which sits lower.  With my old monitor that would make the video much darker and I would have to adjust it so that the monitor was facing almost directly at me to get a good image.  With this one, I sat down and the image was just fine without even turning it or angling it down or anything!!!  It didn't get darker, very minimal glare on it.  The black is nice and black like it should be (with some nice options in the monitor settings to adjust the blackness).  It has a ton of settings for the monitor.  The refresh rate of 75 is nice.  I'm a casual gamer and it is perfect for that, the colours in my game really looked nice.  I can't say enough about this, I was FINALLY pleasantly surprised (as opposed to so much I have purchased that didn't work).  Well worth the money by far!\n"", '\n  relación calidad-precio exacta, pagas por lo que tiene este monitor, lastimosamente es un monitor de 6bits + frc no es de 8 bits verdaderos, esto sirve para gaming por la respuesta tan rápida que tiene pero no para ver colores buenos, en realidad no tiene buenos colores, en general se ven deslavados pero no puedo pedir mas por este precio tan bajo. en cuanto ángulos de visión... tienes que estar directo a el, no puedes verlo de ningún lado porque veras el sangrado de luz de fondo o los colores aun mas deslavados, tiene muy buen brillo, de echo te lastima si lo pones al máximo en la noche, es extremadamente brillante. por default mi tarjeta nvidia lo detecta como un monitor de 75hz, escondiendo los otros modos de 60 hz 50 hz 30hz 25hz 24 hz 23.7 hz. tiene buena nitidez y tiene buenos negros pero repito existe el sangrado de luz de fondo aunque no sea tan severo y repito es bueno para gaming no para colores vivos o ver películas con colores vibrantes y bonitos. Lo que si me molesta de estos paneles es que ni en la pagina oficial mencionan el echo de que es de 6 bits y no 8, lo cual si marca una gran diferencia en rango dinamico y colores, si de por si 8 bits tiene colores pobres, imaginen 6bits: terribles.Es mi primer monitor y no tengo mucho dinero entonces vale la pena.Eso si estoy impresionado con lo delgado que esta el panel pero en si su diseño no es muy bonito que digamos.\n', ""\n  Edit of my original review.Is this the greatest monitor? Probably not. Do I use it fine? Of course. If you want perfect brightness distribution then go buy another monitor. The two bottom corners have noticeable bright spots that can be a bit distracting when the monitor is displaying darker backgrounds. Overall, I'm giving this monitor 5/5 because it works great. I use it to play games and have no complaints.I've never had a higher refresh rate than 60Hz but I personally wouldn't spend too much more on any higher because I find games are playable at this refresh rate and FPS it provides. Would I spend more money on a higher resolution and higher refresh rate eventually? Maybe. But for now, this works great.Buy this monitor if you're not too serious about insane detail.\n"", '\n  Compré este monitor por el simple hecho de que era un 1080p 75hz de Acer. Me sorprendió que estas características estuviese a sólo 1,700mxn. No esperaba mucho de él, pero en estos tres meses me dio una gran sorpresa.El monitor es increíblemente liviano y delgado. La fuente de poder es externa, lo que ahorra costos y ayuda a su estética general.Cumple con todo, el full HD, los 75hz,  y es IPS ( no he probado el FreeSYNC, no uso AMD)Pros:+Es muy ligero, facilita mucho la limpieza del escritorio y el transporte.+Costo/beneficio, es de los mejores que puedes encontrar, superando a monitores 1080p60hz+Tiene varios perfiles personalizables y puedes alternar entre ellos fácilmente.+Tiene unos 30 grados de inclinación para mejor visualizaciónCons:-La base es de un plástico ligero y barato. Aunque para el peso del monitor, no necesita más.-Por default tiene un filtro verde muy molesto. Pero Se arregla en 10 minutos corrigiendo el color.-Los botones los tiene en la parte inferior, Cuesta algo de trabajo moverse en el menú a ciegas, y el botón de apagado es igual a todos los demás botones.-Tiene unos bordes negros que hacen parecer que no está dando la resolución total, pero te acostumbras fácilmente.Recomiendo ampliamente este monitor 100%.\n', '\n  The monitor arrived on time. Very cute and slim in appearance. Manages space on my work table as I have another larger monitor too. Pix quality and resolution was great and a lot better than what I had before. Came with connecting cables which was a plus and it was so easy to assemble the base. I am pleased with the product.\n']"
