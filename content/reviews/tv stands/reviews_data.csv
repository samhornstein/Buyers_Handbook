I didn’t want to have a huge TV stand due to lack of space in my room. This cart has a smaller base which saves much space.  I use it with a 55” screen in my gaming corner. I put PS4 Pro on the shelf and it easily holds it. I hope it will hold PS5 too. Delivery was pretty quick, despite this situation with covid19… Anyway, I managed to assemble it within 20 minutes or so, it’s simple as a pie. My cat Cleopatra really helped me sitting in the box and gnawing that foam inside. I spent much more time on cleaning the room after her.I put the stand in front of my armchair and it looks awesome there. I might move it to another room and thanks to wheels it will be easy, but for now I locked them all. You know, for better stability. I hid all cables inside the columns, so nothing is sticking out now, otherwise my cat will destroy every cord she can find. This TV cart is definitely worth the money. I think overpaying some 5-10$ is much better than finding out my TV broken and my cat buried under it.  So, Cleopatra and I recommend this mobile tv stand!\n', '\n  Item came very fast. Was difficult  to install and the instructions were not easy to follow. I managed to put it together anyway but the instruction manual did not match the items that were in the box such as the screws. For instance the manual will say screw “R” goes with pole “M”. But there’s no “R” screw to begin with in the box. So now I’m left trying to figure out which screw goes with pole “M”. The instructions didn’t match. But anyway like I said I was able to still put the stand together. It’s not as sturdy as I thought it would be. Screws were tightly screwed in yet it still wobbles!!! I have a 47 inch mounted on it and it and it wobbles. I won’t move it as much since it feels so cheap. I guess you get what you pay for. This item really should be no more than $50 or $65 at most!\n', '\n  Super sturdy. NOT EASY TO SET UP. One of the bolt hole had a ton of metal in in which would not let the bolt pass through. Took 15 minutes of filing to make it work. Next the top base plate did not align as it should have. Ended up cross threading two bolts. Had to remove and retap. One of the main upright poles was threaded at an angle making to VERY DIFFICULT to get the bolt to catch and screw in. Finally got it to work. Now that it is all together the top base plate is not level. It is off by 1/4 inch so now I have to figure out how to shim one of the poles to get it closer to level. It has not been a fun experience.\n', '\n  ""I’ve just made some repairs in our apartment and I wanted to put our 65 LG TV there. At first, I wanted to mount it on the wall, but I felt sorry for the walls. I ordered this TV stand by ONKRON brand and I am totally happy now! It’s not that big as I expected, but quite sturdy to hold our TV. This cart has high quality materials and tough wheels. I like it, because now I can move my TV from bedroom to living room when needed. I don’t need shelf, so I did not install it, but I think my wife will find a good use for it later. Definitely recommend it, because its worth it.\n', '\n  This is a very sturdy product I love the way that it’s easy to move the TV now everywhere the only problem I had was the assembly is incredibly difficult\n', '\n  Directions not the easiest to understand but I got it together by myself. Holds my 45” television. Easy to move around.\n', '\n  It’s alright must have good tools and it works.\n', '\n  Just what I wanted and needed\n', '\n  I wanted a TV cart for our dining room and I bought this! This cart doesn’t look like an industrial one, that are mostly used in some social institutions. This model looks modern and perfectly fits our home, it’s just like an ordinary piece of furniture. It’s mostly made of steel and some plastic decorative elements, so it is really durable, I think. At first, I was unable to move the stand, but then I realized that I forgot to unlock wheel breaks. Might be a useful function for those who has pets or kids at home, or even both. That’s absolutely 5 out of 5!\n', '\n  \xa0I’ve just bought a new TV and also purchased this TV stand by ONKRON. What I really love about it is the base! It’s quite small, saves so much space in my bedroom, however this stand has the same parameters as other tv stands with much bigger bases! This 1351 is very sturdy and easy to assemble.  You know, like a LEGO construction. It was delivered the next day and I am totally happy with it. This is my first Tv cart and now I know why people use them. I do recommend it with no doubt.\n', '\n  Die mobile TV-Halterung wurde für einen 55 Zoll Flachbildfernseher gekauft, damit dieser mit wenig Aufwand an mehreren Orten eingesetzt werden kann.Das Paket kam ziemlich zügig und ein Tag schneller als erwartet an.Die Verpackung ist sehr solide und hat bei dieser Größe nützliche Tragegriffe. Die einzelnen Bauteile sind sicher im Styroporformen verpackt und gegen Kratzer o. Ä. geschützt. Vorteile hat es ebenfalls beim Zusammenbauen, da alle Baugruppen übersichtlich sortiert sind. Alle Teile sind qualitativ hochwertig: die Schweißnähte und -Punkte sind entgratet, fast alle Kanten sind mit einem Kantenschutz aus Plastik versehen, gerade entlang des Kabelkanals – dadurch entsteht keine Kabelschnitt- bzw. Kabelbruchgefahr. Der Ständer ist mit einer schwarzen kratzfesten matten Farbe beschichten und sieht sehr edel und modern aus. Die kleinen Rollen sind gummiert und machen kaum Geräusche, lassen sich aber auch in einem mitteltiefen Teppich problemlos bewegen.Alle Elemente lassen sich mühelos einstecken und verschrauben. Man bedarf kein besonderes Werkzeug, da alle notwendigen Schraub- und Inbusschlüssel im Set mitenthalten sind.Für den Zusammenbau mit einer Person waren insgesamt ca. 20 Minuten notwendig, die Anleitung ist übersichtlich und einfach gestaltet.Bei der Befestigung des Gerätes an der Halterung ist es ratsam eine zweite Person einzubeziehen, da der TV meistens etwa um die 35 kg wiegt und nicht gerade handlich ist.Sowohl die Höhe des Fernsehers als auch der Ablage lassen mit wenig Aufwand verstellen, die der Ablage stufenlos. Die Ablage kann auch abmontiert werden, wir verwenden diese jedoch für Apple TV und WLAN Repeater. Die Kabelage lässt sich ganz gut im Ständer verstecken und mithilfe der heutigen Kabellosen Gerätekommunikation nur mit einem einzelnen Stromstecker managen.All in einem ein gelungenes Gerät, was den Erwartungen entspricht und den eigentlichen Zweck voll erfüllt.\n', '\n  Prinzipiell ein gutes Produkt, leider war im Paket eines der Rohre anscheinend von einem anderen Produkt und somit konnte die Querstrebe die den Fernseher halten soll, nicht richtig angebracht werden.

Insgesamt gut rollbar.Marge: Verbindungskabel durch das Rohr ziehen erfordert Geduld, weil mittig inneres Befrstigungmaterial stört.\n']"

I bought a Vizio 40” tv without realizing the legs would be a problem. Hung off both ends of my bedroom entertainment center. Didn’t really want to mount a tv to my wall but was told about this. Had no idea you could buy a center stand for my tv. Genius! Put together fairly easy. I’m a girl & was able to do it by myself. Bigger tv might take 2 to lift onto the mount but I was able to do my 40” solo. Looks nicer than the original legs that with the tv. Almost bought the $40 mount & stumbled across this. Glad I took the plunge for the better deal. Quality on this as far as I’m concerned is A+.\n', '\n  I bought this stand as my only option to install a 55"" tv I won in my studio apartment. I did not have many wall mounting options due to the size of the tv in my small apartment, enter the PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand. It was exactly what I needed and when I ordered it i didn\'t think it would work, but for the price I figured, what the heck. First off, the quality of the materials were very good and sturdy. Instructions and diagrams were very clear, if you can put together IKEA furniture it will be a breeze. I recommend watching the install video on the product page to get the full scope and you will be fine. My tv is a Spectre 55"", not too heavy for it\'s size, but I had concerns if the stand could hold it and not tip over. The tempered glass bottom is what helps keep the stand stable and was thick and sleek looking. I love the cord holders on the back as well. This is a great solution if your TV is too wide to sit atop of a dresser or a small width table top like ours. It has allowed me to have the tv on top of our dresser.\n', ""\n  Omg!!!! I love, love, love this stand, but it was a pain to assemble! I'm an amateur like professional when it comes to assembling ANYTHING, but this stand had me sweating like crazy. I have a 50 inch flat screen and I had no problem with my stand fitting.  Once I finally got everything put together, getting my flat screen on it was super easy!!! This literally took me about 30 minutes to figure out and 20 minutes to put it all together. Also, I honestly have to say the instructions were so irritating that I just looked at the pictures to figure it out. This stand is extremely sturdy, because I clean a lot, so at times I need to move my entire TV shelf to sweep and mop. The TV won't shake or move whatsoever which is awesome for me. I'm extremely happy with my purchase. I had it shipped with same day delivery and it came within a few hours!!!!!! WOW!!! I was shocked at how fast it arrived!!Update: (January 23, 2021) Outstanding quality!!! This TV stand is still holding up perfectly. I haven't had any issues with this whatsoever. I will be buying 2 more for my other flat screens. It's the best stand I've purchased.\n"", ""\n  I bought a big TV on clearance recently and the only negative reviews I saw about the TV were that the stand it came with was super flimsy. I certainly didn't want to risk my new TV falling to the ground so I did some research and this stand had good reviews. So far, so good! My 52-inch TV feels super sturdy on this. It comes with a ton of different-sized screws to help it be universal and I didn't have a problem finding the perfect screws to fit. Good price and product. I recommend it!\n"", '\n  I accidentally threw out the stand that came with my tv during my move because I had the tv mounted on the wall. I needed a stand because I use this tv in my bedroom now and find it unnecessary to put holes in the wall to mount. It’s 55” and just barely fits. It kind of tilts forward but I think the stand is sturdy enough to hold up. Fairly simple to put together and not bulky at all, which I love!\n', '\n  First off, when completed this piece looks very nice with it\'s tempered glass and at $32 its a great deal. My 55"" tv wobbles a little on it when I touch it, but the base seems nice and secure.However, this thing is very frustrating to put together. I\'ve put together my share of furniture and it took me an hour to put it together with my girlfriend helping at certain points. The instructions were a bit vague which was to be expected with a product like this, but you will need a second person to assemble this (one to clamp parts together or hold something at a certain angle while another puts in pieces). We actually couldnt get a screw or two in because the threading wasnt great, but it actually worked out because its easier to swivel now.This stand is also tricky to level. In the end mine still was slightly slanted which I fixed by just hiding a small piece of cardboard underneath the stand on one side. As others mentioned bigger tv\'s end to tilt forward (not to the point where I\'m concerned with it falling over though) so I may wedge something in there to angle it better.Basically, If you can deal with having to mcguyver this thing together to get the perfect angle and not pull your hair out while assembling it, it\'s an aesthetically pleasing little piece for an excellent price.\n', '\n  Holds my 55"" LG nicely.  The LG TV came with feet that are located on each end of the TV.  My TV stand is not as wide as the feet were so I needed a middle mount solution.  This is perfect.  Looks nice and very stable.  I had to use the larger spacers in the back along with the longer bolts.  The bolts seemed quite long so I added a couple washers between the spacer and bracket.  I would definitely recommend this.\n', '\n  It is a wonderful option for small spaces. My sister bought a new larger smart tv and she was very upset that the legs were too far apart to fit her stand. I looked for options and found this. Got it put together and mounted to the tv in about 2 hours because the directions are not very good. They showed too many steps in one diagram. I looked at directions before taking it to her to see what tools were required (she lives in a small retirement community, so she only keeps basic tools). No tools were listed with list of parts so I scanned the few written instructions and found one that said tools required a phillips screw driver but not supplied. Took one with me but half way through assembly I discovered a socket was also needed so I had to return home to get one otherwise it would have taken less time.\n', ""\n  A have a heavy Sony Bravia 40' and this stand holds it like a muscle man. Very hard piece of material that do its job. I recommend it.\n"", '\n  I like that it looks nice and is fairly easy to set up. The base is very heavy but not an issue when it is sitting on the table. I also like the you can simply unhook the TV if you need to.\n', '\n  Good design and modularity, decent value for money. Looks better than original stand of my TV that I lost.Hex key provided in the box was rusty and greasy, that was an unexpected one but I’m willing to look beyond that and give 5 stars.\n', '\n  It was awesome. Delivery was quick, and I was a bit confused at first about whether it could support my 55"" TV. However, the assembly and installation was very easy to do, and it does work like a charm. Love it.\n', '\n  The price and quality of this TV stand is very good for its price . This was used on 58 inch 15kg/33lbs led tv with out any issues.\n']"

Not wobbly at all just need to use spacers instead of washers.\n', ""\n  We bought a new LG TV for our bedroom.  We went to put it on the dresser and the legs were too far apart.  We can't hang it on the wall because of the barn door that runs behind it.  He already had it packed up and in the car to take back to Best Buy when I thought about checking Amazon for a solution.  Enter the WALI stand.  As you can see from the photograph, just exactly what we needed.  Thrilled to be able to keep the TV, because it was on sale and just the size we needed in a smart TV!\n"", ""\n  This t.v. stand looks like feet for your t.v.!  I mounted it on a 55 inch Roku T.V.  Note that the back of this model t.v. has several step offs that make it challenging for the brackets sit flush since the t.v. is not flush itself.  I like this stand a lot.  It raised the height of the unit more than the original feet, which I was hoping for.  Be aware that the height will vary depending on your mount points on the back of your particular t.v.The wires are routed from the back of your t.v. - through the feet and out to the edge of the table concealing them from view.  There are two plastic covers that help hold the cables & wires in place.  This space is not very larger and the plastic pieces did not want to snap into place easily due to the thickness of our power cord.  It was manageable and it looks clean in the end.I believe the stand is quite sturdy but I might be concerned if I had small children around tugging on it.  It will handle slight bumps without budging however.  I did see that Amazon sells safety straps for this problem if you should need them.The kit comes with a ton of bolts, nuts and plastic spacers that I imagine could fit a variety of different sized units.  I think I only used about 1/3 of the supplied hardware.  Presumably, the kit contains a variety of different sized hardware in order to accommodate all of the different mounting options out there.I also installed the WALI Universal Sound Bar Mount Brackets underneath these table top stand brackets.  They are U-shaped and bolt to the sound bar.  It took some adjustments by way of setting them in place - tightening the hardware and then loosening them again to make it fit correctly.  Apparently my sound bar (Sony) has weird mounting points but I made it work.  To be fair the sound bar is older and I saw no reason to replace it.Altogether we find it humorous that this stand makes our t.v. look like it's going to get up and walk away we still like it.  It did the job and it took me less than an hour to put it all together.  I love having the sound bar out in front pointing at my face.  I can hear conversations in movies so much clearer now.  I also have the height of the center of the t.v. directly at our eye level as we sit on the couch.  This stand greatly improves the quality we experience while viewing movies and I recommend it.The instructions were not super helpful but they did illustrate how to assemble the brackets and mount them to the feet.  If you are not willing to juggle bolts and pieces to fit your particular setup you might want to skip this one.  If you have a DIY stubbornness, you might like this kit.  Please note, that I saw a review where someone thought the stand was unstable and prone to tip over.  Based on the photos, it appears that the feet may have been installed backwards leaving the short ends of the feet in the front – which would be incorrect.  Don’t do that, you’ll break your t.v.\n"", '\n  The stand was even better than I thought. It fit my 4 year old 42"" Samsung TV perfectly. It feels really stable and the height adjustment allows you to mount the TV at the exact height you want. It took about 10 minutes to figure out all of the parts and mount the stand on the TV. Just make sure you don\'t mount the TV upside down like I did the first time. The stand comes with a LOT of extra hardware so don\'t panic. The various sizes of bolts and washers are for different types of TVs, so you just have to test a few of them to find the correct match.\n', '\n  Much stronger steel than I expected. Packed very well and the small parts nicely sectioned and label. Easy instructions. Bolts set nice and tight. On my 55"" Samsung the included spacers weren\'t of a sufficient variety so I had to make my own for a couple to get the angle right. I could have picked up some nylon spacers at Home Depot but I simply cut some lengths of plastic tubing. The bolt assortment was just right. Sturdier stand than the Samsung stand that come with the TV and gave me about 1 or 2 inches more height. The 55 inch only allowed for one height setting but smaller TVs should have more flexibility.\n', '\n  Lo compré para una pantalla de 65"", fácil de instalar, el material es acero muy resistente pero un pequeño detalle... Las piezas que van en la base estaban mal marcadas, al final de armar y montar, la parte más grande de las bases quedaba hacia atrás, por lo que no aportaba contrapeso a la pantalla, si no hubiera observado eso y con un temblor moderado seguramente la pantalla se hubiera ido de frente, solo cambié las piezas de la base y con se solucionó pero si alguien no nota ese detalle, puede correr el riesgo de que la pantalla se caiga hacia el frente.\n', '\n  Estaba buscando una manera de bajar un poco mi Hisense H8G. Se siente más resistente que la base original.\n', '\n  Muy buen producto, lo instale en un televisor LG de 65"" y aunque tenía mis dudas al principio ya que nunca había usado un dispositivo de este tipo, al fina me convenció y estoy contento con la compra. Puedes ajustarle al menos 3 o 4 niveles de altura y trae diferentes medidas de tornillos para adecuarlo a tu televisor. Viene con las 2 llaves necesarias para su instalación\n', ""\n  Parts felt like sturdy materials were used, assembly was reasonably simple, my tv had a thicker bottom end so it didn't fit flush but many different spacers and screw lengths are included so I could compensate for that easily.\n"", '\n  I LIKE the looks of the stand. Beautiful design. I DISLIKE that is does not fit the UN58RU7100FXZC. Samsung 58”.\n']"

I bought a Vizio 40” tv without realizing the legs would be a problem. Hung off both ends of my bedroom entertainment center. Didn’t really want to mount a tv to my wall but was told about this. Had no idea you could buy a center stand for my tv. Genius! Put together fairly easy. I’m a girl & was able to do it by myself. Bigger tv might take 2 to lift onto the mount but I was able to do my 40” solo. Looks nicer than the original legs that with the tv. Almost bought the $40 mount & stumbled across this. Glad I took the plunge for the better deal. Quality on this as far as I’m concerned is A+.\n', '\n  I bought this stand as my only option to install a 55"" tv I won in my studio apartment. I did not have many wall mounting options due to the size of the tv in my small apartment, enter the PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand. It was exactly what I needed and when I ordered it i didn\'t think it would work, but for the price I figured, what the heck. First off, the quality of the materials were very good and sturdy. Instructions and diagrams were very clear, if you can put together IKEA furniture it will be a breeze. I recommend watching the install video on the product page to get the full scope and you will be fine. My tv is a Spectre 55"", not too heavy for it\'s size, but I had concerns if the stand could hold it and not tip over. The tempered glass bottom is what helps keep the stand stable and was thick and sleek looking. I love the cord holders on the back as well. This is a great solution if your TV is too wide to sit atop of a dresser or a small width table top like ours. It has allowed me to have the tv on top of our dresser.\n', ""\n  Omg!!!! I love, love, love this stand, but it was a pain to assemble! I'm an amateur like professional when it comes to assembling ANYTHING, but this stand had me sweating like crazy. I have a 50 inch flat screen and I had no problem with my stand fitting.  Once I finally got everything put together, getting my flat screen on it was super easy!!! This literally took me about 30 minutes to figure out and 20 minutes to put it all together. Also, I honestly have to say the instructions were so irritating that I just looked at the pictures to figure it out. This stand is extremely sturdy, because I clean a lot, so at times I need to move my entire TV shelf to sweep and mop. The TV won't shake or move whatsoever which is awesome for me. I'm extremely happy with my purchase. I had it shipped with same day delivery and it came within a few hours!!!!!! WOW!!! I was shocked at how fast it arrived!!Update: (January 23, 2021) Outstanding quality!!! This TV stand is still holding up perfectly. I haven't had any issues with this whatsoever. I will be buying 2 more for my other flat screens. It's the best stand I've purchased.\n"", ""\n  I bought a big TV on clearance recently and the only negative reviews I saw about the TV were that the stand it came with was super flimsy. I certainly didn't want to risk my new TV falling to the ground so I did some research and this stand had good reviews. So far, so good! My 52-inch TV feels super sturdy on this. It comes with a ton of different-sized screws to help it be universal and I didn't have a problem finding the perfect screws to fit. Good price and product. I recommend it!\n"", '\n  I accidentally threw out the stand that came with my tv during my move because I had the tv mounted on the wall. I needed a stand because I use this tv in my bedroom now and find it unnecessary to put holes in the wall to mount. It’s 55” and just barely fits. It kind of tilts forward but I think the stand is sturdy enough to hold up. Fairly simple to put together and not bulky at all, which I love!\n', '\n  First off, when completed this piece looks very nice with it\'s tempered glass and at $32 its a great deal. My 55"" tv wobbles a little on it when I touch it, but the base seems nice and secure.However, this thing is very frustrating to put together. I\'ve put together my share of furniture and it took me an hour to put it together with my girlfriend helping at certain points. The instructions were a bit vague which was to be expected with a product like this, but you will need a second person to assemble this (one to clamp parts together or hold something at a certain angle while another puts in pieces). We actually couldnt get a screw or two in because the threading wasnt great, but it actually worked out because its easier to swivel now.This stand is also tricky to level. In the end mine still was slightly slanted which I fixed by just hiding a small piece of cardboard underneath the stand on one side. As others mentioned bigger tv\'s end to tilt forward (not to the point where I\'m concerned with it falling over though) so I may wedge something in there to angle it better.Basically, If you can deal with having to mcguyver this thing together to get the perfect angle and not pull your hair out while assembling it, it\'s an aesthetically pleasing little piece for an excellent price.\n', '\n  Holds my 55"" LG nicely.  The LG TV came with feet that are located on each end of the TV.  My TV stand is not as wide as the feet were so I needed a middle mount solution.  This is perfect.  Looks nice and very stable.  I had to use the larger spacers in the back along with the longer bolts.  The bolts seemed quite long so I added a couple washers between the spacer and bracket.  I would definitely recommend this.\n', '\n  It is a wonderful option for small spaces. My sister bought a new larger smart tv and she was very upset that the legs were too far apart to fit her stand. I looked for options and found this. Got it put together and mounted to the tv in about 2 hours because the directions are not very good. They showed too many steps in one diagram. I looked at directions before taking it to her to see what tools were required (she lives in a small retirement community, so she only keeps basic tools). No tools were listed with list of parts so I scanned the few written instructions and found one that said tools required a phillips screw driver but not supplied. Took one with me but half way through assembly I discovered a socket was also needed so I had to return home to get one otherwise it would have taken less time.\n', ""\n  A have a heavy Sony Bravia 40' and this stand holds it like a muscle man. Very hard piece of material that do its job. I recommend it.\n"", '\n  I like that it looks nice and is fairly easy to set up. The base is very heavy but not an issue when it is sitting on the table. I also like the you can simply unhook the TV if you need to.\n', '\n  Good design and modularity, decent value for money. Looks better than original stand of my TV that I lost.Hex key provided in the box was rusty and greasy, that was an unexpected one but I’m willing to look beyond that and give 5 stars.\n', '\n  It was awesome. Delivery was quick, and I was a bit confused at first about whether it could support my 55"" TV. However, the assembly and installation was very easy to do, and it does work like a charm. Love it.\n', '\n  The price and quality of this TV stand is very good for its price . This was used on 58 inch 15kg/33lbs led tv with out any issues.\n']"

The only design issue I have is the connector between the two sides of the wall bracket prevents much horizontal adjustment. I can only slide my tv 3-4 inches each way.
