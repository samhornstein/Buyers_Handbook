I noticed if I could adjust the bass/treble on the device it made a huge impact on sound. Some headphones fit a niche that plays a certain kind of music. These don't fit exactly into hip hop/rap or hard rock but they sound good with minimal adjustments.\n"", ""\n  Bought these for my child for under twenty dollars. I'm impressed wirh the overall quality of the construction and the sound. The seller reminded me that there is a one year warranty. That coupled with the price assures me this was a good purchace.\n"", '\n  Ordered these for my 3rd grader. His old headset no longer fits... He has a big head... wears adult hats and all... So this new headset was great!! It’s been helping when he needs to focus and drown out sound from his brothers while doing school work. Sometimes I let him use my iPad and he will use the headset. He literally can’t hear us! I was hollering for him from our kitchen into our living room, good sized open floor plan... He didn’t even budge like he heard any sound other than what show he was watching on my iPad. He likes the volume and play/pause control on the cord. Apparently this has a built in speaker, he wants to try it out on his next zoom call... :) Is recommend for the price and they look sharp too!\n', '\n  For the price, these headphones are better than most in their category. They are comfortable to wear and I even forgot I was wearing them after a while.\n', ""\n  I don't recommend these headphones if you have any earrings. Especially cartilage piercings. These headphones will sit uncomfortably on your ears/earrings and end up causing pain. I wore them for about an hour before I had to switch to ear buds.

I love them and now I'm probably ordering two more pair because everyone loves them and customer service was amazing.Took my rating down. Loved them great sound quality and nice fit.

If you're ordering keep this in mind.\n"", ""\n  These headphones look a lot better than they sound. Maybe since the logo looks curiously like the Beats one, I was expecting something a little more quality, but they are not. If I had known just how tinny the sound quality is, or how annoying the piece covering the ear feels, I would not have purchased these. But for the price, they are okay. They do work. They fold. They look nice. They don't quite cancel out the noise. I can still hear when people walk outside my room whereas my old broken skullcandy ones (that these were supposed to replace) did muffle sound to the point where I didn't notice people at all. So this is a solid okay product.\n"", '\n  OK I admit I was suckered by the lovely turquoise colour, but these headphones really deliver good quality sound for listening to my podcasts whilst gardening, without the problem of earbuds falling out all the time or other people not realising I was concentrating on listening and could not hear them! I can even do the vacuuming without having to stop my programme because I can hear the sound readily above that of the vacuum itself. My techie husband was so impressed we ordered a second (red) set for him to use with his amateur radio exploits and podcasts: not such a good fit for him but overall he is happy with them. Both sets arrived within 24 hours of ordering.\n', ""\n  Item looks great BUT product name is: Artix CL750 Foldable Noise Isolating On Ear Headphones. This headphones has nice and clear sound but you will hear every noise which is in your surroundings loud and clear, and everyone will hear what you are listen to, even if the volume is very low. It is good if you have kids or partner and you want to know what they are doing but usually people buy headphones to don't disturb others with sound and to cut distractions from outside. This item does not isolate noise at all not even a tiny bit and if I wouldn't bin the box straight away after unpacking (being happy with the item look) I would return it for the above reason. If you want to use it in noise free space you will be fine. The item price and look is good.\n"", ""\n  I bought this set to replace the small ear pods I used in my mobile phone when listening to Audible downloads when taking my daily exercise walk. These are really comfortable to wear and give a very clear sound which is easy to hear and masks most of the outside noise.  It has made listening a lot more enjoyable and is far more comfortable than the old 'stick in the ear' pods. First class product. Also very colourful and has brought favourable comments from people I meet on my wlak.\n"", '\n  I am thrilled with these headphones. I have just started s degree with the Open University so needed headphones for tutorials and forums and these are perfect. I have quite a small head so the majority of headphones are way too big for me and look absolutely ridiculous but these fit perfectly.

The bass is present and strong but it doesn't overwhelm the full mids and smooth highs. These would give my $250 Sony a run for its money.The only con is the smaller size that could be problematic for those with adult-sized heads. I think these are actually children's headphones. With both earcups fully extended the bottom doesn't extend past my earlobes and the cups flare out somewhat, which compromises the seal.

I got these to listen to music on my hi-fi when my wife is watching TV. I listen to lots of different types of music so I like a crisp balanced sound. I am not overly concerned about a heavy base but I like it in the balance. I bought these as I did not want to spend too much but did a fair amount of research first. First let me say straight away that the positive reviews of these headphones are well justified. They sound great. The sound balance is very good. They are really comfortable. They look great. In fact I am not sure there is much to choose between the sound quality on these and the ones that my son broke which cost more than 10 times the price. These are great value for money headphones but more importantly they are very good headphones. Well pleased. Recommended.\n', 'Betron HD1000 Headphones with Bass Driven Sound for iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mp3 players etc', ""\n  I really want to give these five stars but the only thing keeping them back for me is a personal thing so regardless these headphones are reccommendThey arrived fast the day after they were dispatched, came nicely packaged in a box an a hard carrying caseHave the look of a premium set of headphones higher than the price they are, plastic on the side is quite thin and looks like you'll have to be careful with it thoughBut the important part is the soundFor the most part they sound amazing, better than a few more expensive headphones I've found, however this is when I'm using them with something like the Samsung music player that has an equalizer where I can adjust the bass, when using something like YouTube with no equalizer the bass on certain songs can be too overpowering to the point it detracts from the songThe majority of things I've listened to without an equalizer still sound good but its definitely noticeable on a few songs that the default sound of the headphones is VERY bassy, but as I said, it's all down to personal preference and a lot of people like that in a pair of headphonesI've been listening to a range of genres with them from indie rock like modest mouse and broken social scene to hip hop artists like Kendrick lamar and earl sweatshirt to prog rock with some pink Floyd and king crimson to shoegaze and dream pop like slowdive and the antlers and they handle all different genres incredibly wellWhen it comes to hip hop they can be punchy, to metal brutal, warm for acoustic and folk and a very full sound for shoegaze and progI've also been using them with my dss2 surround sound processor for my Xbox one and they make a great pair of gaming headphones so all around reccommend but for those that prefer headphones that aren't too bassy I'd keep it in mind when you don't have an equalizer\n"", '\n  These Betrons popped up as a suggestion (""people also bought.."") just before I was about to checkout some Plattan II\'s.. I googled them etc.. no techradar or whathifi review, and it seemed like there were online bots posting fake positive reviews, and perhaps some deletion of bad reviews going on.. the review spotter website then gave them an ""adjusted"" score of 3 and a half, rather than 4 and a half stars.. hmm... I checked a blog and it gave them a fairly glowing (legit sounding) review.. I thought what the hell, they were damn cheap (and I would rather have over ear than on-ear) so I bought them. They arrived super quick (like, I was confused when the package showed up because I was expecting other things!).. I was delighted to find they come with their own carry case. (many more expensive headphones wont). They look lovely witht the faux wood, and the fabric covered cable is a big plus (helps stop tangling). The Gold is a bit tacky and gaudy IMO, but its a minor complaint. First listening impressions: they are louder than my Sony ZX310\'s.. and listening to the ""test your headphone"" playlist on Spotify, they brought out the bass of a cello beautifully, including the slap of percussive playing, and really sounded ""present"".. A more chill acoustic guitar / vocal set on youtube is also holding up well.. Now, as much as I enjoy music, I\'m no audiophile, but these sound lovely - the warmth and high end of the guitar comes out well.. I think the extra sound isolation from over-ears is definately a factor, but considering these are a good 10 euro cheaper than my Sony\'s (AND have a carry case!) the quality is far superior... I did notice quite a bit of sound leakage when my friend tried them, but he claims this is because he has a weird shaped head and so headphones dont form a proper seal on his ears! (also I think he was PUMPING the music.).. Lastly, they are comfortable.. I havent tried them having them on for a long time yet, but off the bat I imagine them to be less fatiguing than my Sonys\' (as they arent tight on my ears)... Im very glad I didnt spend twice the price on the Plattans! These are good headphones. For the price they are unbeatable\n']"

And yet after trying myriad other brands, I rate these as my personal best.  After my first pair died (took several years of daily use), I went on a quest to try a bunch of different headphones.  After wasting hundreds of dollars over the past couple years on everything from fancy $200 pairs, cheap Amazon-branded pairs, and plenty of random ones from places like Big Lots or Walmart, I finally just came back to these for a meager $15.  There's simply no beating the combination of comfort (especially for people with glasses!), sound quality, and price.  I work in front of a computer for hours at a time, and almost always have headphones (and eye glasses) on.  I probably have a larger than average head shape too.  Every single other pair I have tried ended up making my ears hurt before long, except this one.  While the construction quality is decent, I do expect to run through a new pair every couple years, but at this price point, it's really hard to complain.  In summary, I am so thankful these are back in my life.\n"", '\n  These phones sound really nice, for being under $20. I have owned at least 30 different headphones since 1974, and these sound as good as any of the $100 Sennheisers I had back when Elton John\'s ""Rocket Man"" was new music. The power requirement for the voice coils in these phones is remarkably low: They sound great for listening to music on a cell phone or tablet, and you won\'t even have to crank the volume up to maximum. Some of the headphones I have owned recently don\'t work well with mobile devices, requiring more output power than the audio chip in a cell phone can provide - that won\'t be a problem with these Sony ZX-110 phones. They sound just fine on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S at 50% of max volume. Frequency response is very good for economy priced phones, with clear treble and adequate bass response to let you ""feel"" the drums and bass guitar. Soprano and contralto vocals sound nice and clear, without that ""muddy"" sound that cheap phones give that don\'t have enough high-frequency response. These phones fold up into a very small, compact footprint that is easy to store in a medium or large purse, or any briefcase, backpack, or laptop computer bag. The cord is 3 feet, and has a 90° angled plug. This cord length is great for use with a cell phone in a shirt pocket, although not really long enough for home use with a desktop computer. If you are going to use these phones to listen to music on a home stereo or desktop computer, you will need an extension cord, but these aren\'t terribly expensive.COMFORT: Sony got this right: these phones grip your head just firmly enough to stay in place, without squeezing you to death. I have had a couple of Sony phones that were horrible in this respect, with way too much compression on an average sized head; that\'s not a problem with these phones. The ear pads are very comfortable, and they don\'t press hard enough on your earlobes to make you need to take your earrings off to use the phones.SUMMARY: A Typical Sony economy-priced headphone with much better sound than you might have expected at this price point. Folds up very small for carrying in a purse or laptop computer bag, Very comfortable to wear for up to several hours.PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n', ""\n  I loved these Stereo Headphones when I first got them. They were comfortable to wear (I hate ear buds) and the sound was surprisingly good considering the low $15.00 Cost.  Now the bad news, I've had the Headphones approximately two months and the connection through the plug has gone south. You have to constantly put pressure on the connector plug  to get any sound at all. I guess I'll move on to another manufacturer test my luck there.\n"", ""\n  These are great headphones for music and movies for the price.  I have never owned a big-money pair of headphones & after buying cheap ones that I had to replace multiple times due to breakage, I decided to get these after a recommendation from a friend.  After buying them for myself, I also bought them for each of my kids.  They're great for average use... i've never been bothered by outside noise, they are comfortable, and the sound is of good quality.  They also are much sturdier than the cheapie $10-$20 ones I've gotten before.  (My kids haven't broken them, which is a minor miracle)I do recommend getting a bag or carrying case for them (I use a Crown Royal bag:) it certainly helps protect them and they do seem vulnerable at the hinges where they collapse for storage.The only thing my kid complains about is the wire is kind of short. I prefer it because the wire is nice and thick and never gets tangled.  with my previous cheap ones, it was always the wires that were delicate & one or both ears would go out.  These are so much sturdier. (I think he just finds them too short when he wants to sit in the recliner with his iPad on the table & watch his Minecraft. If you don't require your headphones to meet these specific and ridiculous needs, the length should be fine.)\n"", '', '\n  The sound is very good, clear and a package of best sound.

A little background: I ONLY use these headphones at work AT my desk, so there's no chance they fell in water or were stepped on or anything.

I miraculously found my original EarPods so when these arrived I compared them directly to see whether they matched up. The ones Amazon sent me are just like the ones I got with my phone, and the packaging is just like all my other classic Apple stuff: everything sealed, meticulously held in place, documentation, etc.Photos below show all the box details and the packaged EarPods. The only thing that seemed slightly different was the thickness of the main cord---these are a tiny bit thinner it feels like (but I got my IPhone7 some time ago so these might be the ""current"" version). As for sound, I can\'t tell any difference between my original EarPods and these replacements.  My one star off is because the shape of the actual earpiece is not my favorite.

I have a 2 and 4 year old and the fit both of their heads well and they used them properly. Super awesome price as well. I will be highly recommending these.\n', '\n  Bought these for my niece and they work great!! Love the sharing feature and she raves about how comfortable they are. It’s also nice that you can set the volume as well, so no worries about her listening to music too loud. The colors are her favorite colors as an added bonus.\n', '\n  Just got today. Feel very sturdy & work well. My daughter will love the color!\n', '\n  Very nice head phones for children. Very comfortable and nice sound quality. My 1yo used these but the 3&5yo liked them also.\n', ""\n  These headphones, so far, are very well made. They are extremely bendable, almost to the point of being a little floppy. This is good though for kids who may be a little rough on their headphones. The color is pretty, and looks exactly as pictured. They don't look or feel cheap or flimsy. My 9 year old has these for school to use with her chromebook. She says they're comfortable to where, and unlike others, she's not spending time pushing them up and adjusting them, as she has had to do with the others she had in the past. They're not too big or too small, and adjust easily. As for the sound, no complaint. They sound very clear. The volume control is a little confusing. Either the volume is low, and is controlled, or it's loud, and not volume controlled. I was expecting a normal volume+/- button, and automatic volume control for kids. This is not a bad thing, since she's older and won't voluntarily blast her eardrums out, but if you're looking for something to send to school with a child, that is controlled and doesn't get too loud, this is not it.As for shipping, the headphones were nearly folded and incased in bubble wrap, then secured in a product box. The box showed a diagram, and there was an instruction pamphlet inside. The box itself was inside another large Amazon box, and well protected with more bubble wrap. It arrived on time and in good shape. No complaints on shipping.\n"", '\n  We have bought several headsets the past couple years that don’t last very long. These appear better made and more sturdy, but time will tell. They fit our 6 yr old granddaughter well and they are comfortable, yet snug.  She said they block out the noise well.\n', ""\n  Bought this for the kid when he's playing on his switch. Well packed, as usual. Sounds quality, for the price, there's no complain at all. Really nice to have the switch for decibel limit, wish the kid didn't have access to that... Note, that I've put 1 star to noise cancellation because they are not noise canceling headphone.\n"", ""\n  I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing these headphones are! They can also work as a little speakers if you wear them around your neck of by the bed at night. The sound is awesome based on our 9 and 11 years old boys. Super good quality. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the little lack of comfort after you wear it for a while. But overall I would recommand this product and would buy it again!\n"", ""\n  Purchased for my 6 year old for virtual school and gaming. They're super comfortable for all day wear and sound amazing for the price. This is actually our second pair as the others shattered during a vacuuming accident.\n"", '\n  I purchased these for my daughter and her online schooling. They work perfectly for her. They cancel out other noise so she is able to concentrate while there are other things going on. Great value for the price and they arrived quickly.\n', ""\n  This pair of headphones is fit for young kids that have some limited use for speaking but enough for online classes these days. The sound quality is decent and you don't have to worry about the volume being too loud for children. It lightweight and the nicely colored too.\n""]"

The original Earpods that came with my Apple iPhone 6 Plus started cutting out. I decided for the cheaper option of the Amazon headphones rather than a slightly more expensive Earpod replacement.  I now regret that decision.The Amazon headphones are not even CLOSE to the same comfort, fit, quality as the Apple Earpods.  No matter how I tried, I just couldn't fit the Amazon headphones in my ear. I tried the different sizes and twisted. They would stay in a few minutes and then pop out.  It was a disaster for exercising.I found the Amazon headphones very uncomfortable. They didn't just sit in the ears like the Apple Earpods.  They had to be squeezed inside the ear canal. Obviously Apple (and all manufactures) have patents on their designs that Amazon cannot copy.  So, Amazon must have been very limited in their choice of design.  It's just NOT good.  And it plugged the ears so much that I heard my breathing and heartbeat.  Once I put them in, I couldn't wait to get them back out.The sound quality is garbage. It's not even CLOSE to the quality of the Apple Earpods.  The sound is loud, but very harsh and tinny. I guess if I never had any headphones before and used the Amazon headphones, I would probably just accept it because I had nothing to compare it to.  However, I had the Apple Earpods, so I could make a direct comparison.  It's not even close. So, I went ahead and ordered another Apple Earpods - which is only about $5 more.  I should have done that initially.  I cannot recommend the Amazon headphones.\n"", '\n  These are very inexpensive headphones but they exceeded my expectations. The silicone pieces (there are 3 sets in order to fit your ears) are effective at cancelling out noise at a general office/home level. These also stay put well so long as you choose the right size of silicone cover.\n', '\n  The cables are very flimsy and thin, similar to the headphones you can buy at the 99 cent store, the left headphone has a buzzing sound when listening to music, and this headphones are brand new! Very disappointed, amazon basic products used to be so much better :(\n', '\n  The Amazon basic ear headphones works in the iPhones with clear and loud audio on the ear pieces as well as speaking into the mic.  Although its fidelity on both is not as good as the APPLE branded version, it is still very useable.  Will buy again and recommend this as a low cost item.\n', ""\n  I liked the color - my sons can't tell me that they don't know which pair is theirs...  the color identifies the perpetrator.\n"", '\n  My 13 year old uses these on a daily basis. She is rough on earbuds & they have held up great. Good sound quality. Would recommend!\n', ""\n  They produce sound but it comes with a lot of background static that is audible even with volume turned up. It would be nice if it also came with the clip to hold it to your shirt, but they discontinued those head phones. I wouldn't buy these again and I am thinking of returning them.\n"", ""\n  These headphones are surprisingly nice for the money. better then the Raycons I returned...only issue is they won't sit right in my ear. I am going to change the buds and see if that helps.\n"", ""\n  They say one year warranty and all nonsense. It didnt work for even 2 weeks. The plugs fell off. And I had no energy/time to pursue the warranty. It's a waste of time.\n"", ""\n  First I had purchased the iPhone lightning Nylon cable by Amazon basics and find it extremely well made and quality written all over. Now I needed ear pods look alike, and I didn't hesitate one bit when I saw Amazon Basics ear plugs. After I got them delivered, I wasn't more happier. The bass, treble, clarity have blown me away. I cannot believe it came in that price range. Five Stars!!!\n"", ""\n  Man, these earphones are the worst. The sound quality is okay for the price. However this doesn't matter, because whenever you move your head even slightly the plastic wires rub your clothes in a way that's akin to going through a tunnel or the sound of an ultrasound, so you can barely hear the music itself - it's bizarre. Not to mention the fact that they are so uncomfortable and tricky to put your ears, especially if you have small ears like mine. I've bought headphones that cost half this and they've still been half decent - don't bother buying!\n"", '\n  Surprisingly good.Bought these as a spare In ear phones. Well it happens that these have a better sound and mic pick up than my genuine apple ones that came with the phone.The apple phones will now become the spare unit.Very good.Have a very good balance of high and lows. Lows are at the right level for my liking. And more surprisingly the high frequencies are also all there, at least for me.Highly recommended\n', '\n  Ho acquistato questi auricolari per avere un ricambio “da battaglia” da tenere sempre in borsa per sostituire le mie AirPods se necessario. Spedizione Amazon perfetta come sempre, il gioco è stato consegnato in 24h. Le utilizzo con il mio Iphone8 utilizzando l’adattatore per lo spinotto e devo dire che mi hanno davvero soddisfatta. Per il loro prezzo contenuto hanno una qualità audio buona. I tasti presenti per cambiare canzone, mettere in pausa e rispondere alle telefonate funzionano bene e senza ritardi. Anche la qualità audio in telefonata è buona e il microfono funziona bene. Ovviamente non sono auricolari di fascia alta ma la qualità del suono è pulita e senza rumori di fondo. Sono dotati di gommini intercambiabili di diverse dimensioni che permettono agli auricolari di adattarsi a ogni padiglione auricolare. Spero che la mia recensione possa tornarvi utile e buon acquisto!!\n']"
