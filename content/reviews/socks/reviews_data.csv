Anyone who wears these types of socks knows they are hot, itchy and uncomfortable and come in an array of unattractive colors.  I was so excited to find this set of socks.  They have the look and feel of regular trouser socks with fun designs.  Once I put them on I was in love with them, as my feet felt like they were wrapped in a gentle massaging cloud and my feet stayed nice and dry through the whole day.  I did not want to take them off and ended up switching to a new pair and wearing them all night long because they were that comfortable.  I do not feel like my legs are choking or can’t move and my legs and feet do not feel painful when I remove them.  Made of cotton, polyester and spandex they fit a size 6-10 (I am a 10 and they felt great) and carry a light compression of 8-15mm Hg which is perfect for me for everyday use.  I am super happy with these socks and will be using them often.\n', ""\n  As a long-time diabetic, I've worn compression socks before. But they were very medical-y, polyester-y, and boring. Also, they made me feel like I should also be shopping for a walker and comparing nursing homes. But my doctor insisted I need to wear them daily for now.These socks are the polar opposite. The colors and patterns are fun, and the knit breathes well. They exert a nice amount of compression without feeling like a vise.I expect I'll be buying more, because the price per pair is very reasonable.\n"", '\n  If you have to wear compression socks, they might as well be pretty.  These socks are so comfortable.  They are not very tight and easy to get on.  They stay up nicely.  The foot of the sock is roomy, nor cramping of the toes.  I really like these and would recommend them.\n', '\n  Great socks. I have large calves and these socks fit just perfectly.  I like the compression.  They are not super tight like athletic pressure socks.\n', ""\n  I have been trying different compression hose to get a good fit.  I love these as they are easy to put on and take off.  I lovethe way with the sock made out of cotton etc doesn't hurt my toes and actually feel good when on.\n"", '\n  I need to wear compression socks for medical reasons. I have made ""cute"" socks a fashion statement, especially with yoga pants at the cardiac rehab gym. These fit the definition of cute. They fit easy and are not as hard to get on and off as some compression socks. They are not as heavy weight as some I own, so are not too hot this time of year. I would buy them again.\n', '\n  I have always worked standing on my feet.  These socks are perfect for revitalizing my feet and legs.Other compression socks that I have used, pressed against the ends of my toes making my toenail bed sore.  These do not have that shortcoming.  I also have to brag on the fun colors and patterns!I would say these have been the best compression socks that I have purchased based on cost, cute patterns, comfort, and fiber content.  I will definitely be purchasing again and again.I have also worn these during running.  They provide fantastic support!\n', '\n  So gorgeous! I love that people don’t automatically know that they are compression socks by looking at them. They are much cozier than traditional compression socks too. Love them! Wish that they had the same material with solid colors like navy black and brown. That would be stellar.\n', '\n  Very pleased with these socks!\n', '\n  I bought the 20 -30 mmHg 6 pack. They are fabulous. I waited a month to review and the swelling has gone from my legs completely. They are fairly easy to put on as long as the foot is smooth then the leg part pulls up easily. I love the colours but am now looking for more summery ones. I wash them in a regular cold water wash and they go in the dryer with everything else. I went by the size chart and the fit is perfect.Highly recommended.\n', ""\n  I decided on this set because it ticked all the boxes for me, the tension I wanted and a price range that worked for me.  I wasn't willing to pay a lot for my first ever compression sock purchase.  So I took a chance knowing that I wouldn't lose much money if I ended up disliking them. I ended up loving them!They are very comfortable, they don't seem to hold moisture and they have held up very well after numerous washes.The value of this product is great!\n"", ""\n  Les bas sont de couleurs très attrayante. Le tissus est vraiment bon. La grandeur de pied est vraiment la bonne pointure. Cependant, après quelques utilisations, j'ai 3 paires de bas qui demeurent avec une bonne compression au niveau de la jambe et reste bien en place au niveau du genou. Les trois autres, ils ont tendance à s'affaisser un peu vers le bas. Je crois que ces derniers doivent être les 8 mmHg et que les 3 premiers 15 mmhg. Donc, visiblement c'est peut-être une question de pression aussi. Tout dépant de ce que vous chercher! Même si les bas descendent un peu, je les mets quand même car ils sont très confortables et beaux.\n"", ""\n  I bought these because they had a high cotton blend, thought they wouldn't get as hot as other compression socks, but too many other issues. The colors are great, however that's the only good part, the feet size is fine but they are too small and because they don't pull up high enough they keep sliding down  and have to continually pull them up. I ordered 6 pair and none of them are the same size, they are very thin cant see them lasting long.Really not worth the price, wont return because until you wear them for a day don't really know how they feel.\n""]"

One pair got a hole in them on the second wearing.\n', '\n  First time buyer of this brand.  Probably last time too.  Fit is good, and they are comfortable but they have spent all day creeping down my calf or nestled happily at my ankle.  I have literally pulled them up 50 times.  I have what I would consider average size lower legs so I believe this to be a sock issue rather then a body type issue.  To be fair, this is the first of 5 pairs.  If I discover the remainder to be different I will amend this review. But for now, not a great sock!Additional Commentary - I have now tried 4 of the 5 pairs.  3 fall down constantly.  1 stays put.  Washing does not seem to either correct or worsen the issue.  Original view has not changed.  Would not buy again.\n', ""\n  I like these socks for several reasons. These socks look great with their patterns. They are very soft and can be worn with anything and can be worn even at home. The material isn't cheap, but it isn't the best. It is pretty good though. For me there was only one minor problem, which is that since I'm a slim guy with thin calves, the socks are a bit loose and sometimes tend to fall, but not drastically, just a bit. Overall, I would recommend these because these socks are comfortable, the material on the socks is good, the patterns on the socks look good, and the price isn't expensive, but at the same time it isn't a steal. The price range isn't too bad. Personally I would be willing to buy more socks like these, but different patterns of course, and I will definitely buy more products from Goodthreads.\n"", ""\n  My main problem with these socks are that they feel synthetic.  I prefer cotton socks so I bought 3 different types of dress socks with varying amounts of cotton to synthetic.  This was too synthetic feeling for my comfort.The flower socks somehow weren't stretching when I first wore them but they do now.  Not sure what was wrong at first.Other than that, they seem fine.  I won't buy them again but they seem fine if the synthetic/cotton ratio is ok with you.\n"", '\n  I bought three sets of these socks for myself, the silliest possible, and I bought another three sets for gifts. All four of us love them. The smallest man commented on their great fit, apparently he is difficult to satisfy, and the largest man commented on their great fit as well. Three other people remarked on them unsolicited. One person noticed them on top of my laundry basket and remarked on them. Imagine someone looking at your laundry and commenting. Those were the most ridiculous ones with garishly mismatched colors. He liked that. Two separate doctors remarked on them, ""cool socks"" when I removed my boot for them to examine my foot. I\'ve tried a lot of socks and I have some kind of problem with all of the other types, except these. I recommend these socks for yourself and they also make great gifts. And you cannot predict who will appreciate the muted tones or the most garish ones or the most silly. Just buy the socks and give them away. Let the recipient do with them what they will. Let them make hand puppets if that\'s what they want. They\'re so inexpensive that they\'re nearly free. They stay up. They don\'t impress a line into the skin by the elastic, the sewn toe is comfortable, the weight is perfect, they breathe very well, they insulate, they\'re soft, they\'re not too hot, and the length is fine. Finally, socks that hit all the marks.\n', ""\n  I recently received my 5 pack of socks from Amazon's Goodthreads brand and I'm looking forward to wearing them out and about. These dress socks all have a common color palate depending upon they type you chose. I went with the blue/green option and I like how the colors are vibrant and bold. I've purchased several garments from Goodthreads and I've been pleased with them all. Great clothing for a great price! Their deals will knock your socks off!\n"", ""\n  I really enjoy these socks and their designs. They're soft, comfortable and my feet never sweat or get cold, an ideal sock blend. Only thing I don't love about them is they're a little too stretchy, by the end of the day they're sagging just a bit and feel a little stretched out. Just pull them back up and they're good for a few hours.I wear size 13 shoes and have muscular legs, they're very comfortable and not tight like many other socks so I'll take this minor issue any day vs. socks that compress too much. Bottom line: they're worth it and I have no regrets, happy with the product and will probably pick up another 5 pack when needed.\n"", '\n  When i received this product i was pretty shocked with the designs..  I have seen and used other socks that have weird designs and i was pretty unimpressed with the quality of the pictures..  Once I opened the package, the socks do have a great feel and are definitely good quality...  They were a little on the bigger side, but not something that you cant hide.I would buy them again but i would get basic designs nothing with animals.\n', ""\n  This is my second purchase of Goodthreads men's socks.  Purchased for my husband and they are perfect.  Gorgeous designs, great quality and so much nicer than the run of the mill socks that are around.  His shoe size is 12.5 and these fit him perfectly.  I had been a little concerned that they might be a tad on the small size, but absolutely not.The quality of Goodthreads is excellent, and their prices are very good for an excellent product.  A shout out to them for producing socks, which can often be just functional and boring, and making them fun to look at and wear.  My husband loves them, which is high praise from someone who generally doesn't even notice what socks he's wearing!Excellent products, highly recommended, and great quality.  I shall definitely be buying a third set in the future.\n"", '\n  At first glance the socks are ok. Not great, not terrible. A bit thin perhaps and a touch too bright pink, but ok.

What I like even more than that is the fact these stay where you want them!Omg, GONE are my days of that horrible feeling when my footies slowly slip down my shoe until they’re off my heel completely.  These socks stay put and that additional little “tab” at the heel is the single reason and it’s absolutely perfect.  When I first considered buying these socks, I wondered whether or not I’d feel that little tab.  Well I didn’t.

They do not provide me any arch support, but that may be a size issue (they do not hug around my foot).

The elastic around the ankles is very strong so they do stay up well, but it is not great if you have poor circulation (as this makes it worse). They are very well made and should last a very long time. (but are not cushioned)\n']"

They're low cut, no show and there is no slip backing that keeps these socks from stretching. I am pretty hard on socks so I can tell these are good quality, they don't stretch out by the end of the day. Because they're made of cotton, I have no foot sweating and no odor.\n"", '\n  When I tried these socks, they were comfortable and the most modern in design and it was non-slip that were useful while wearing inside and outside activities. Socks fit right into my size and with different colors. My brother also liked these socks and he is also going to buy and I also refer to others too.\n', '\n  These socks are great. The elastic is good, and they do not slip away. I feel like I can never have enough “no show” socks, and these fit the bill. The price is great. I wear these socks with my running shoes, golf shoes, or basically any shoe style that I do not want a big sock showing. The colors are nice and neutral, even though that should not matter.\n', ""\n  This is a fantastic deal for quality no-show socks. They are extremely soft and comfortable. The silicon heel grip ensure your socks never slip off which is a problem I have with Uniqlo no-show socks. I normally wear size 12 shoes, so these were a little tight when I first put the socks on, but within 10 minutes the cotton stretches and I can't even tell I'm wearing socks.\n"", ""\n  A really nice sock set for warmer climates. The mesh tops offer exceptional ventilation, while the darker tones are a classier look than the plain white, and don't stain easily. I chose this style as my father has issues with the socks that fit his feet being too snug in the ankle, where this design neatly circumvents the entire issue.\n"", '\n  An amazing quality no show socks, they are indeed 8 pairs and not 4, these can be unisex except the blue one, what i really like about these socks are the anti slip gel on the back, usually no show socks comes off while you are jogging some will just come off when you start walking in slightly faster pace, but these fit like glove\n', '\n  Really impressed with these socks.  Especially for the price - these are a great value.  They work like expected - they are no show socks and have the rubber-like strips in the heel to keep the sock from slipping down.  Very happy with this purchase.\n', '\n  This is a very well made product. It does exactly whats advertised. They are comfy and have yet to slid off or feel uncomfortable.  I have worn them with sneakers and with dress shoes and you can barely see the sock.\n', '\n  Very good product..\n']"

Where once we would go to a department store and grab a bag off the shelf, now we fall down a rabbit hole of online opinions. Let me save you some time.Buy these socks.They do not pill. They do not fade. They don't get holes. They don't lose their elasticity. They are warm in winter and cool in summer.I bought a pack of these a year ago for everyday use, and having worn them, well, every day, I can assure you they are still in top shape. I don't actually work on my feet, but I live in a city and I walk a lot,and I'm generally an active person, and these socks have held up really well. Some day in the distant future when/if they do finally wear out, I will happily replace them with more of the same.\n"", ""\n  Before these socks happened upon my life, I was a nervous wreck. Death, I sensed, was lurking around every corner. I never knew which day could be my last, and the sheer thought of my immediate demise was crippling.But alas, that fear is no more. For once I slipped into these cushiony foot sleeves, the malice and dangers of this world fled my every approaching step. My nightly strolls down the freeway are met with screeches of joy from the tires upon which seat ever so vigilant drivers. Before, I knew that if I had done so, surely I would be met with quite the blow from the the bumper of an SUV, driven by the inconsiderate, and loathsome Karen. Rather, my methodical march of leasure was met only with the soft touch of a cool summer's breeze.It was not more than a day ago, I was held at gunpoint by a ruthless, ill-tempered thug that quickly turned face upon noticing the socks. Hence realizing that he was indeed incapable of harming me. Yes, it would appear as though I am impervious to all known threats. However, there is one troubling unfortunate consequence.For you see, as these socks are now my protectors, their view of threats, it seems, holds no discrimination to any soul within my immediate vicinity. My friends now avoid me as I cross their path. Women avert their gaze and seek refuge from my presence. The common stranger, repelled by the sight of the glowing neon halo around my shins. My own parents have disowned me. I am alone...My only friend. My only companion now, is eternal safety.So yeah the socks work and they look cool. 5/5\n"", ""\n  After a few years of wearing suits like a corporate robot and buying those damned dress socks that come in a 3 pack with 3 different patterns, most of which are ugly as sin, I found my self with a drawer full of these time sucking mismatched burdens. Every time I did laundry, it was a half-hour game of memory, and there was always one left over at the end! One day I said, screw this!, bagged them all up, looked at my pile of worthless white socks, which also had a few too many varietals, threw those in too, and dropped them off at the homeless encampment under the freeway.So, i didn't have any socks for a couple days but, when these came, I loved them so much that I bought three more packs! (Plus they're black and match 90% of my wardrobe) They are comfortable, have a nice little compression to the feet, don't smell like hell like my dress socks did at the end of the day, and I never have to match and fold socks again! Pile them all in the drawer, and any two that I pull out in the morning always match. Hours of my life have been given back to me. And they say you can't buy time!\n"", ""\n  They are basically good socks for the price, but don't count on consistent sizes.  I've ordered three packages of six of the same size but have gotten three different sizes.  One was way too large for my 8.5 shoe sized foot, one I consider normal for the sock size, and the last package contained a much smaller sock which suited me just fine because of my smaller feet, but most men would find them way too small.  See photo.\n"", '\n  With big feet and a hatred of wearing shoes, I’ve always been hard on socks. For years I’ve gone back and forth between Hanes and Fruit of the Loom and just like clockwork, holes form in the heels. The last straw was when two different package of socks started getting holes on only the second and third wear. That’s when I came to amazon and searched reviews for the best socks.Fast forward two years after buying these and all of my socks still little wear and no signs of any holes starting any time soon. As everyone knows, socks seem to disappear in the wash so I’m only back here to buy more to replace the ones that have gotten lost. Yes they are a little more expensive than Hanes of FotL, but worth every penny!The one thing I don’t love is the brand name plastered on the top of every sock because I mostly walk around in my socks only (and it’s a bit awkward when at a friends house that doesn’t allow shoes inside, it’s hard not to feel like a walking billboard). It would be nice if they could be like the other brands and put the name on the bottom. But because I love the durability of these socks so much, I’ll overlook the blaring brand name.\n', ""\n  I really like these socks. They are comfortable and they have not shrunk after many washes, unlike many of the Merino wool kind which shrink to where they're too tight to put on. But these Dickies socks have a peculiar anomaly going on. After many many washes, they still continue to shed as if new. (see pic). I have to use a brush to clean my Hobbit feet each day i get home from work. I'd like to buy this sock but, this issue drives me crazy. So I can't buy it again or recommend them.\n"", ""\n  These socks exceed expectations in their function as a covering for my feet. I daresay they might even be the best socks available, as far as regular socks go. It's a nice, noticeable step up from the baseline in terms of comfort and quality. It's hard to get really fired up about socks, but I mean, if these were a pizza instead of socks, they would be a wicked good pizza, and I'd probably be more enthusiastic.\n"", '\n  One wash later. ONE.This is two separate pairs. My other socks are fraying in the same spot.I’ve never had this issue with socks in my life.Too bad, as they felt great when new.Ripoff.Never again!\n', '\n  If you are looking at these for anyone over 12 years old you are looking at the wrong product.  Bought these to use for my 17YO as a work sock and they are waayyyyy too small.  They are also too small while also being on the small size.  Fortunately I also have a 10 year old who now has a new 6 pack of socks.  Gotta be careful with sizing I guess is the lesson learnt.\n', '\n  If, like me, you were thinking of spending a bit more on socks as the ones in supermarkets are a bit rubbish, and leave bits of fluff everywhere, then I implore you not to buy these. It’s fluffmageddon, to the point where I leave them on until the very last moment before getting into the shower, as the house is otherwise coated in lint. Alongside the goldtoe ones as quite the worst socks I have ever purchased. Appalling.\n', '\n  Good quality socks, fit well and are very comfortable.\n', '\n  Very comfortable nice product and fast delivery would highly recommend\n']"
