Firstly, at the time of this review, this mouse is $13. Amazing. That being said, when I initially bought this watch, my expectations were pretty low. When the mouse arrived, I plugged it in and started to test it out, but the mouse would not track. Thinking, ""Oh, it\'s just a $13 mouse, what can you expect"" and returned it to get my money back.Having my impressions of the Nemeanlion soured, I then invested a bit more and went with the M801 Mammoth (love it, btw) and thought that was the end of it, but then I received an email from the seller, Challenger USA. After explaining why I returned the product, they were very gracious and ended up sending me a replacement for free in good faith.So having a functioning Nemeanlion, here\'s my review. In comparison to the Mammoth and other intermediate computer mouses, it\'s obviously not as good. It\'s too small for my large hands and the ambidextrous nature of the mouse is a tad uncomfortable, but when I gifted it to my friend who has been using a supplied HP mouse, it was amazing. You may think this is lame, but the braided cable is a god-send. The LEDs are bright and will perfectly accent any black and red setup. The forwards and backwards buttons are simply perfect and the adjustable DPI makes the mouse useful for any situation.Overall, this is the perfect choice if you just want to upgrade from a basic mouse for the price of what is a night\'s dinner. Gets a thumbs up from me.If you found this review helpful, smack that button :)\n', ""\n  Bought this for my son as he has been nagging me for an RGB mouse after seeing my Razer Chroma Setup (RGB keyboard, mouse, mouse pad, speakers).  Him being only 8 I told him we'll start with something on the cheaper side and if he can show he can take care of his computer equipment i'll eventually buy him a high end one.Anyways, came across this on Amazon search for rgb mouse, bought it and set it up on his computer.  The build quality is quite nice and the colors are nice and bright.I dont recall if there was a software to control the lighting schemes but there are presets you can switch between pushing a specific button on the mouse.  Also the size feels good in the hand and as far as its performance it seems to be pretty accurate.Overall great price, good mouse.  Worth the purchase.\n"", '\n  I usually don\'t give 1 star but this is a waste of money at any price point.  I don\'t know who would ""game"" using this mouse but I would not expect good results at all.  The application that comes with the mouse doesn\'t keep settings correctly (DPI/Color) so what are you buying this for?  I was trying to get it for work, but it feels like Very cheap plastic and i prefer using an old standard mouse than this.  Save your Money!\n', ""\n  The mouse in itself is nice to look at first glace and even retains a nice feel for it's design. It attempts to be ergonomic for most but I suppose some like myself would understand the problems once they attempt to get a feel for it.Firstly it will fit most hands fairly well with it's contoured shape. It's designed to let your hand rest with it and that's a good thing. However once you get past the grip and come to terms with the additional button placements... This is where you start to notice the problems. I believe the side buttons (thumb buttons) are placed too far forward. The forward button despite it's raised surface textures is too far forward for a relaxed grip on the mouse. Then if you would move your hand forward as if to clutch the mouse you cannot press the other middle mouse buttons so easily without a very uncomfortable bend in the middle finger (perhaps only people with large hands may experience this problem?) and I find it to be very impractical despite it being a button to be used for utility especially given consideration that it is fully programmable. The fact you have to switch your hand positioning frequently in order to use this mouse also makes it quite useless for flicks if you're a person who plays shooters or real time strategies. You won't be able to get comfortable with a single grip and work with it as you're learning two wrist motions to get the same results now that you are using two ways to grip your mouse to use the additional buttons.Once you get past that, I'd also say it's not great for FPS or shooters in general because the mouse has a tendency to skip inputs from the optical. I mean it reads the mouse pad or surface you put it on no problem. It just seems to skip coordinates if that makes sense. You can't have a pinpoint aim when your mouse is off by an X or Y variable because it skips marginal gaps between each increment of movement. It feels as if it counts by 2's and there is no half measures so you're always attempting to adjust and by that time you've probably already lost the fight. So if you're looking to buy this mouse for a shooter, save your money and upgrade to a brand that you know is reliable and has massively good feedback about it's use in shooters.This mouse for me however was a cheap place holder until I can replace my last gaming mouse for shooters and other various games. So it will fit the bill until I can replace it, however I won't recommend you buy this if you're only interest is competitive shooters, the nerd rage you will suffer far exceeds the value of this product as it's unreliable and inaccurate.\n"", ""\n  I thought the other reviews were overrating this mouse, but they weren't! For the price you get, it's a legit gaming with great quality.In terms of gaming, it's quite precise and the additional mouse buttons are convenient. I personally love the ergonomic shape as well, it fits well and is *slightly* bigger than other mouses, which I prefer (it's easier on my wrist).The color changing is cool but a tad distracting. I can see how many people would love this though.Overall, it's an awesome mouse and i highly recommend it for its price2 month update: The mouse developed some defect and now randomly activates its dpi settings (it changes sensitivity throughout use). No physical damage has been done to the mouse. It's become a real nuisance because it is now unusable for gaming. I was really upset to have this issue come up after some time of owning this mouse\n"", ""\n  \xa0I needed a new mouse and wanted something that would work with my PC and Mac.  Most importantly, my hand was completely fatigued from using the Magic Mouse at work, and I wanted something that would fit my hand better, on a budget.  The Redragon M602 fit that bill perfectly with its larger size and thumb/third/fourth finger support.The packaging, (not pictured) was surprisingly robust compared to other mice I've ordered in the same price range.  Its a nice professional-looking touch.The documentation was easy to read which is very nice.The Redragon M602 requires no software to work or control the color and DPI settings, as the buttons to perform these tasks are on the mouse itself.Performance-wise the mouse meets my expectations, and most importantly works with the Mac, with a small caveat; the side-buttons dont work.  Mac users who are looking to get these working can either use USB Overdrive (freeware) or SensibleSideButtons (opensource).  One note on USB Overdrive:  it tends to mess up the pointer when used in Finder.The USB cable is fairly long and comes with a velcro ribbon for cable management.  Also very surprised to see a ferrite core on this thing for signal mitigation.  Looks cool in a overkill kinda sense.Besides that, its a fantastic mouse that matches well with my keyboard.  See my pictures for size comparisons.\n"", ""\n  I just received the Mouse today. I will update my review over the next several days/weeks.The mouse is a laser mouse. I probably missed that when I was going through all of their different mice. I wanted an optical mouse but it is what it is for now.The packaging although cheap is a nice touch.  Comes in a hardened plastic container with 4 clips, one on each side.  The mouse is a nice size and a nice shape.  It is just ever so slightly too small for my hand so not huge but decent sized.  (I wear an XL winter Glove)The RGB's for anyone who cares are a bit washed out but do their job for that aesthetic value.  The software is literal garbage. For the life of me the mouse will not allow me to set the DPI setting to a custom amount, in my case 1000.  It just won't go to it. Over and Under, no matter what you do.  Corsair has much better software, much simpler, much better overall.Immediately I notice when playing a game the mouse jerks to the left when dragging the mouse around, to look/pickup items in the BR I'm playing. Not sure what is causing this as I even have the pole rate set to 500 instead of 1000 to be more accurate instead of responsive.  I would say this is a defect either with the product itself (being the hardware) and or the software, either way not going to work for gaming.  The mouse pad is clean and nothing is obstructing the lasers view.So, the mouse literally stills registers over a half inch off the table. You can't re-position your hand in the middle of combat without literally throwing your aim WAY off because even when you try to set the mouse back on the table it reads too quickly and throws your aim way off.  Absolute trash.I do not reccommend unless you do not play games.  In the software there is no Mouse Height settings so it cannot be adjusted.I have tried everything to adjust the height of the lasers reading. There are no options.  This is an absolutely terrible mouse for competitive play. Now I have to go find some ink to print return slips and get this trash sent back.\n"", '\n  Bought it for my brother a few months ago, who plays too many games. However, I asked him recently if he was happy with it and he said it was the best thing.Great quality and design.\n', ""\n  I got a used one! Update: it works fine but slow, not as fast as I thought and the software doesn't work with Apple (mac in my case), so keep that in mind.So far it worked in my work station, I just received it but will try it at home with more calm, I give 4 stars Bec it came used!, I won't make a huge deal of it but obviously had been used, the feet are scratched and the protective film is peeled off partially, as I said before if it works fine w my computer I will keep it, don't want to go through the hassle of send it back and get another one that God knows in what condition will come!!, Amazon, put your things together Bec we are paying for this service!\n"", '\n  for the price i am very impressed with the product. the design is good and also the build quality. overall i would highly recommend it as a good budget mouse\n']"

Coming from the Redragon Griffin mouse, this one is a huge improvement in the ergonomics but still has much to desire. It can be on the more round and wide size and often times my ring and pinky fingers just slips right off when I reposition the mouse. No complaints on the dpi adjustment and scrolling, the side buttons on the other hand, I disagree with the first button being ""L Shift"" then the ones above being the ""Back"" and ""Forward"" causing me to stretch just for the forward button. The placement is other wise perfect just above your thumb rest. I never found a use for the ""fire button"" and polling being adjusted from the bottom is okay. I wish I could remap these buttons, but the software drivers don\'t appear on the website to download.Battery life is Great and the included USB-C charger means your can use it both wired and wireless. Very clear on charging with light indicators. The wireless receiver is well... a receiver, it works.The RGB is colorful, and bright, the placement being on point, no hot spots, overall good. Can\'t change it without the software so its stuck on the rainbow affect. (Edit) With the software you can only change to outer edges to a static color. The Logo can cycle through colors but it isn\'t very bright. Last the scroll wheel only lights ups to indicate the charging level.The build quality of this mouse is fairly plastic, much like the other Redragon mouses but still sturdy. The rubber feet on the bottom, again much like their other products, its okay.Overall at $40 this is a great budget gaming mouse like many of their product, My only issue was the lack of software put a limitation on my overall comfort.Update: As of 10/26/2019 the software is now available on their website!Update: As of 11/20/2020 Mouse is still doing great and haven\'t had any issues with it so far. I also add mouse grips to the side to solve the grip issue.\n', ""\n  I'm typing this on a mechanical keyboard from Redragon and usually love their stuff/ long time customer. I decided it was time to purchase a wireless mouse when my old one started squeaking and found this one. The first one had a sticky scroll wheel so I ordered a replacement. The replacement stopped working on the second day when I plugged it into my pc USB to recharge even though the battery was not dead. I tried resetting the switch on the bottom and it did nothing. Also tried plugging into the USB charging port on my powerstrip and still was not working. Sad because I'm tempted to try a 3rd time but for now I'm using my old squeaky wired mouse.\n"", ""\n  I owned a very similar version of this mouse that was wired-only, the MSI Interceptor DS200. It's been my favorite mouse for a while now, and I wished there were a wireless version. Behold, the Redragon M801P-RGB Sniper Pro.Now, this fooled me at first, because I thought it was an MSI product, seeing as how they both feature a red dragon as their mascot. However, totally different company, identical build. This of course, led to some driver issues.Their website shows the mouse, but no driver is available at the time of writing. However, I was able to contact the seller here on Amazon and obtain the driver with their help. Thanks again guys!All that aside, this mouse is absolutely wonderful. It has the perfect conformity to the hand. The left and right mouse buttons are concave so your fingers nestle right into them and it has just enough extra buttons for gaming. The light strip on the base of it is awesome, and it even animates when you plug it in to charge it from zero to full.\n"", ""\n  This is the best mouse I've used in years.  There is a groove to hold the ring finger in place, and it is overall extremely ergonomic.  I got this to replace a 5-month old Corsair Ironclaw that already died on me.  I've had great luck with Redragon mice in the past (my old wired one is still in use after almost ten years).  This is my first wireless Redragon.Battery life seems to be pretty darn good.  Only charged once the first night I got it, and I've used it for five days now.  Battery indicator in the Sniper software shows 90%.  Better than the Corsair or the Logitech I used before.Unlike other mice in this price range, the buttons are EASY to reassign.  I've got copy/paste/cut/double-click, etc. all set up and it took less than five minutes.  DPI is on-spot, too.Nothing not to like, really.  Might be good to have some added weight, but it's definitely not a deal breaker.\n"", ""\n  Don't waste your time if you want a good mouse.There is software for this mouse. There is no guidance on how to download software for this mouse. Their website is not user-friendly. And this mouse doesn't even have software for it, this product is a straight-up lie. On their website, when you look up this mouse for the software, a mouse does come up, but it isn't this mouse; it looks totally different.The mouse feels lightweight but has a lot of drag.You can't program the buttons because yeah, the software doesn't exist.Their customer support is just a hoax, it doesn't exist either. I e-mailed their customer support (because that's the only way you can contact them. There is no number or live help) twice and gave several days for them to respond. No automated or human response.The plastic storage box it comes with is difficult to open/close.If you want a good mouse, look at a different brand.\n"", '\n  Giving this a three star because of the Redragon software issues: I was unable to change and save settings (DPI, RGB, button assignments etc) on Windows 10. I tried reinstalling the software and reconnecting the mouse, restarting pc and restarting the software as admin, but nothing worked. Returning it tomorrow. Otherwise, for this price, it definitely feels like great in your hand. And it doesn’t look or feel any less premium than those more popular gaming mice (Corsair, Razer, Logitech etc). That’s why I’m giving it three stars even though I’m returning it. If you don’t have any software issues, you’ll definitely love it.\n', ""\n  Works super well.  Good battery life, slides smoothly, has lots of useful buttons.  Blinks yellow to let you know that it's low on power; you just plug the cable into it and keep rolling.  Only minor complaint is that the cable that came with it is super stiff to the point that it interferes with using the mouse to a small degree.  USB-C cables are still pretty expensive so this effectively adds significantly to the price if you want to replace it with something better.  OTOH you only need to have the cable connected for maybe 1/4 of the time you use the mouse—if you charge it consistently at night I doubt you'll need to have it connected during use at all.\n"", ""\n  I've been using this mouse for about 6 months now. I was looking for a wireless, RGB customizable mouse & for the price, this was the best I could find. My hands are pretty big & this mouse fits perfectly in my palm. It's smooth & has wicked fast response time. You'll have to download Redragons software to be able to customize the mouse settings. There's a ton of options that I'll probably never use. The RGB customization is great, you have the ability to choose from the full RGB spectrum. The ONE thing I find dissapointing with the mouse is that the only time the scroll wheel lights up is while it's charging (red/green). In the pictures, the scroll wheel is presented in different RGB colours.. which was quite misleading. I really wish the scroll wheel was RGB customizable. If RGB is turned on (why else would you buy this mouse if you're just going to turn off the RGB) the battery lasts about 3 days before needing a charge. If you turn off the RGB, I  suppose it would last about 4-5 days. I do wish I could get a solid week before charging.Overall, I definitley recommend the mouse.\n"", '\n  Great mouse... VERY comfortable... quality build... BUT software would NOT work with Windows 10. Battery life quite adequate... lasts about 2-3 days with RGB with average use 10+ hours a day.There were actually 2 versions of the software available. When first purchased in Sep 2020, an older version was installed. Found instructions on YouTube that showed it needed to be Run as Administrator to get the Macros to record. That would not be so bad BUT the software would NOT save the settings.Second software was then released a couple of weeks later. It was more user friendly and DID NOT need to Run as Administrator BUT although you can save the macros, it would NOT apply the settings to the mouse.Seems I am NOT the only one having this problem. Could not find a solution ANYWHERE and company is NOT responding...had to return this mouse and settle for a Corsair at TWICE the price.... ouch!\n', ""\n  Nice mouse and works fine, both plugged in and wireless. I bought it so that I could customize it though, and the software doesn't work. It recognized the mouse, but I can't tweak the DPI settings, remap button, or change the light settings. I tried to contact them several weeks ago via the website's online form, but never received a response.If they can help me get the software working properly I would raise the rating, as otherwise the mouse is fine.\n""]"

It\'s a great mouse and a good upgrade!Right away, I should note that you shouldn\'t get too fooled/confused by the ""8 programmable buttons"" tagline--it\'s counting every single button on the mouse, including the standard left and right click and buttons to adjust settings on the bottom of the mouse that you would never use during normal gameplay or computer use. The only two ""extra"" buttons on this mouse for gamebinding are the two on the left side you can click with your thumb. The other buttons are: left and right click, the mouse wheel, two buttons underneath the mouse wheel to adjust the DPI of the mouse, and a button on the bottom of the mouse to switch between profiles. So if you\'re wanting more buttons to use during gameplay--like, say, having an entire MMO hotbar on your mouse--this isn\'t the right one. It\'s useful if you just want to have a couple of buttons that are easily accessed though! I like using my mouse buttons for stuff like push-to-talk and melee attacks in FPS games.As for the changes compared to the previous version of the Deathadder mouse, they\'re small but for my use they\'re good QOL changes. The biggest improvement is the spot underneath the side buttons where you\'re meant to rest your thumb--in the previous version this was a glued-on rubber pad that game off after a year or so or use. In the V2 mouse, it\'s now a textured part of the rest of the material of the mouse--the only way it\'s coming off is if the entire mouse case comes off! I could see the texturing being warn a bit, but that\'s certainly better than my thumb being gummed up by glue after the pad fell off!The other main change that I\'ve noticed is that I think this mouse is slightly smaller than the previous version. This is great for me, since I\'m a woman with small palms and long, thin fingers--I often have problems using gaming mice and controllers comfortably. That being said, I\'m not sure if this would be as comfortable for users with larger hands--if you\'re worried, I\'d suggest seeing if you can get measurements for a mouse you find comfortable and then comparing it to the size of this mouse.I believe the profile and DPI buttons are also new features, although honestly I haven\'t messed with that much since I\'m not experienced with those settings and I haven\'t needed it for my own gameplaying. It does seem like a good feature and the buttons seem like they\'re good quality and I\'ve never accidentally pressed them during gameplay, which is great. Probably want to check other reviews if you need more information there.Looks-wise, this is simple, but pretty looking mouse. The light on the logo and mouse wheel is really colorful but not bright enough to be distracting when the lights are off in the room. It\'s pretty easy to use Razer\'s software to change the color to your tastes, or you can leave it on a default setting where it cycles through various colors in a rainbow order. I know there\'s also a feature that game devs can use to have the mouse colors be manipulated by the game itself, but I\'ve only ever played one game where I know for sure this was implemented--Overwatch changes the color of the mouse based on the character you\'re playing as. I don\'t think it\'s been used by many other games, and honestly I don\'t find myself looking at my mouse that much while playing anyway--it\'s probably a feature that\'s more fun on keyboards.Overall, I think this is a really great mouse! I recommend it for people that game on their PC or otherwise use their computer enough to want something that has a few more features and/or is a bit more sturdy than a cheaper mouse. If you\'re a huge tech nerd or want more button options, it might be a better idea to save up for a more expensive mouse. But I think at this price point this mouse has a lot of comfort and control.\n', '\n  Really disappointing buy. I purchased this mouse as a replacement for a Razer DeathAdder Chroma.It had a similar feel to my previous mouse (although surface was a little rougher) but was quite comfortable in my hand.After plugging it in, I was prompted to install the Razer Synapse 3 software to configure it. Installation was easy and they finally included a ""Guest"" option that doesn\'t require a Razer account, which was a nice change.This was where things started to go downhill. I rebooted my machine to finish installing the software and noticed it took 5 additional seconds to shut down and boot into Windows. I figured it was just taking additional time to finish installing the software.This was not the case - the Razer Synapse software added 5s to both startup and shutdown times on a system with a fast PCIE SSD that normally takes a few seconds total.I uninstalled the software and rebooted again - low and behold my startup/shutdown times were back to normal.I re-downloaded the software from Razer and reinstalled. It again added the 5s.This is unacceptable - I also noticed it using significant system resources when idle.I figured - oh well crappy software, but I can probably work around it. So I went into Razer Synapse and set up the mouse and saved my profile to the onboard memory. I disabled Razer Synapse from automatically starting during startup and exited the program.It was about then that I noticed the mouse was doing the ""color wheel"" effect where it cycles between different colors. It didn\'t save my lighting settings!I looked around on the forums and apparently this is by design - the onboard memory does not support saving macros or lighting effects (even a simple static color). In one post a Razer representative gave a BS answer about on-board memory being limited. In this day and age NAND is extremely cheap and adding a few bits (hell even doubling the on-board memory) would cost less than a cent. The truth is, the mouse was poorly designed.This is all not to mention that my previous Razer DeathAdder Chroma supported saving lighting effects to on-board memory. Completely unacceptable!!! I am returning this mouse and sticking with my old one until I can find another suitable replacement.\n', ""\n  I'm really impressed, never thought I'd find a high quality gaming mouse for under $50 but this is it. Only two side buttons but that's about all I use anyway, even when there's a bunch of them. You can adjust the DPI in the software instead of having extra buttons on the mouse, which I like as well.The software that comes with it lets you adjust the brightness of the led and you can set it to sleep after 5, 10, or 15 minutes, or turn it off. Yes I love gaming but I'm not into all that rgb rainbow lighting, gigantic keyboards and mice that look like they came out of a comic book. Clean, white, and softly lit is very pleasing to me (I turned up the brightness for the pic, normally I keep it just a little brighter than the ambient lighting). Glorious PC makes a white mouse for $90 but it doesn't have that simple, aesthetically pleasing look I was going for, it would have looked out of place on my desktop. Now I have to get a white xbone controller and my setup will be complete.\n"", '\n  Esta opinión tiene importancia dependiendo quién la lea. Si eres gamer, eres profesional o alguien que simplemente quiere un mouse bonito.Características:-El mouse es grande, yo al verlo en la foto pensé que sería pequeño, pero no, es grande, si tienes mano pequeña posiblemente lo sientas incomodo, pero nada a lo que no te puedas acostumbrar.-No tiene ajustador de DPI, ya que este es el Essential, es el mouse de gama baja/entrada que tiene razer. Sin embargo, puedes ajustar el botón del scroll (la ruedita se puede presionar y hace click) para ajustar los niveles  de DPI ya que yo en lo personal, uso los botones del pulgar (los laterales) para otras funciones.-Estéticamente es muy bello, tanto el logo de Razer y el scroll prenden de un color muy hermoso, me estoy enamorando de las cosas blancas y este mouse es muy bonito.Ahora bien, dicho lo anterior, van mis sentimientos encontrados y la parte ""negativa"".Yo uso a la par de este, un Logitech G502. Este lo compre porque estuvo en oferta en $499. Lo compré principalmente para jugar videojuegos, busqué por todos lados y en ningún lugar dice que tipo de SENSOR tiene. Razer en su pagina oficial presume un ""SENSOR DE 6200 DPI"" ¡¿Pero eso qué?! ¡YA BASTA DE PENSAR QUE UN MOUSE SE PUEDE VENDER POR LA CANTIDAD DE DPI! es el sensor lo que importa. Yo no conozco a nadie que use mas de 2000dpi ni para trabajar/navegar o jugar.Investigando por mucho tiempo, descubrí que parece ser tiene un PIXART 3329 o PIXART 3328. No tiene 3360 ni el famoso 3389.El mouse a la hora de jugar, se comporta bien, aun que no diga que tipo de sensor tiene, funciona bien para juegos, tiene un frecuencia de 1000hz, algo RECOMENDABLE en todos los mouses. En pocas palabras, funciona perfectamente para juegos, no noté ninguna diferencia al g502.Por ultimo.

Sinceramente el sentirlo, se siente mal, de baja calidad. Hoy en día los mouses duran de 20 hasta 50 millones de clicks, este se vende como ""10millones"" algo, sencillamente bajo. Tanto por la cantidad de clicks que soporta y por la calidad que se siente, dudo que te duren mas de 1 año.Conclusión:-Si el mouse lo encuentras en menos de $500, compralo, es un buen mouse y mas si eres agarre de PALM GRIP. Pero si lo vas a comprar porque es Razer y vale $800 O MAS! definitivamente NO LO COMPRES. Vete por un G203 de logitech. Tiene mejor calidad y un buen sensor.\n', ""\n  Now depending on how experienced you are with tech and peripherals, you could read 'Razer build quality' in different ways. To clarify, it's not great.The actual mouse design itself is wonderful, it fits perfectly in the hand, is very lightweight for the size and the braided cable has minimal drag. It also syncs nicely with Razer's Synapse software allowing you to customise the buttons, adjust the sensitivity and alter the brightness of the LED lights. Strangely it also allows you to reduce the poll rate from the standard 1000 to 500, and I can't think of any conceivable reason why someone would want to do this.And big kudos to them for making their product in white for those of us with white desktop aesthetics. It's a really stylish, sleek looking device that walks that line between minimal and gamer device well.However, it wouldn't be a Razer product if it didn't come with some sort of build issue, and in this case the mouse wheel squeaks. Not constantly, but often enough to be noticeable and very annoying. The mouse wheel itself rotates smoothly and I haven't experienced any performance issues but the squeak, oh the squeak. I will be taking apart soon and attempt to fix but it's just a disappointingly typical experience when buying Razer peripherals.\n"", ""\n  Been an owner of the Deathadder 2012 for many years now and it finally gave up on me so I decided to purchase as it was identical to the original but at a very good price.Everything is the same except the side grips are not rubber like advertised, they are instead the same plastic coating as the mouse which isn't as near as comfortable or easy to grip as the rubber ones. Very disappointing.\n"", '\n  the right click button when you click a few times makes a squeaking sound as if its rusting or something, and the left click button register a single click as a double click sometimes.\n', ""\n  This mouse is perfect, I'm new to pc and it seems to be absolutely fine for me. Light and really big too so ideal for anyone with big hands as it fits comfortably. The light is only white but I have a all white set up so this is fine for me :)\n""]"

The button location are solid enough for me to be satisfied the only issue I have with this mouse is that the scroll wheel now spins freely and is one hell of a headache playing most fps games as the wheel usually switches weapons in most games.So for example you run out of ammo in game and want to switch to your secondary.. well you'll switch to it but switch right back about 3 times. Kind of a deal breaker for clutch moment gaming.***edit***Turns out i'm an idiot. There's a button that locks and unlocks the scroll wheel..LMAO sooo yeah no this mouse is great i'm just not smart enough to properly utilize it.\n"", '\n  I have not even used it yet I bought this and I opened it up Immediately notice that it was used looking at the bottom gliders.. upon further inspection I opened the weight casee and low and behold fingerprint smudges and scratches.Im pissed\n', '\n  Let me start by saying that I\'ve used a lot of gaming mice, like, over 50 of them. The Logitech g502 was always a quality mouse and tons of people love the thing just based on the design and overall quality of the mouse; That being said, there are a few things to consider if you\'re thinking about getting this one in particular.The Pros of this mouse are fairly straightforward, and are as follows:- Comfortable shape for most right handed people, but should be more comfortable for people with medium to large size hands.- Good build quality which easily places it in the same category as other \'premium\' around this price point or even a bit higher.-  Scroll wheel: this is one of my personal favorite features of the mouse. Allows infinite scroll to get through annoying EULA pages quicker and also quickly raise or lower volume on YouTube or other video streaming sites, but without sacrificing the much needed precision of the standard mouse wheel steps. Feels satisfying to use, but it is made of metal, which leads to a negative I\'ll be mentioning later on.- Sensor: The Logitech Hero sensor has been tested numerous times and found to be roughly on par with the PMW3360 series sensors (including the 3366 on the original g502) while being advantageous for usage in wireless mice due to the lessened draw of power which allows for a longer battery life.The Cons of this mouse make it hard to recommend to everyone, and are why I don\'t usually recommend it as a first choice.-Weight: My god. This thing is one of the heaviest mice I\'ve used for an extended period of time. I don\'t know exactly how much this weighs, but it feels pretty similar to the original, which I believe weighed in a little over 130 grams. Most gaming mice target a weight of 100g or LIGHTER, since lowering the weight of the mouse will make extended use easier and will allow for a greater degree of control.- Not a truly ""safe"" shape, this may or may not matter to you, but I felt that it\'s worth mentioning. Obviously this is a mouse for right handed people, and it may not necessarily be a great fit for you if your hands are very small (I have very small hands and cannot reach the sniper button at all, but the mouse is still comfortable).I would say it\'s a top tier mouse, but only if you can look past the weight. I would recommend that, as always, if you have the ability to do so, you should go to a local store and try some of the mice out to see which feels best to you, and make your decision after you have an idea what type of mouse shape you want.I won\'t recommend that you do or don\'t buy a product, so I\'ll leave it at that.\n', ""\n  This would be a wonderful mouse other than the constant click/double click issue. The first one I had for a very short time. During that time I was doing a lot of gaming/designing and the click issue showed up very quickly. Amazon was great and provided an exchange. During the time I had the new one, I was not doing as much gaming/designing so the click issue took longer to show up. I am convinced this is a design flaw in the mouse itself. I will not purchase another one of these. The price is not worth it at all with the click issue.  To be clear, the click issue is that when you click or try to click and drag, the mouse either doesn't hold the click or double clicks. I have tested this extensively. If it wasn't for that issue, this mouse would be wonderful. However, this creates a lot of issues with gaming, graphic design and so much more when trying to work and renders the mouse almost useless because of productivity.\n"", '\n  Scroll wheel broke within the first week and now it freewheels like fidget spinner. Useless.\n', '\n  i play alot of many types of games which makes me need as many buttons as possible on my mouse. i had the g502 and then when i i saw an upgrade, as any serious gamer, i had to have"" the best"". the laser and accuracy is the best ive touched ever.BUT!!!!! they need to add this laser to the g600 mmo mouse and /or arrange the button layout a little bit better for short finger . i frequently hit extra buttons on the mouse and the thumb button makes me hold the entire mouse in a uncomfortable way.in summation  if you are hard core about fps\'s this is the mouse you need, want and have to have. if you are all about warcraft or whatever other mmo is out right now, not so much.....\n', ""\n  \xa0Customization: 5/5Buttons: 5/5Features: 5/5Control: 5/5Durability: 5/5Grip: 4/5RGB: 5/5Review: G502 Hero fills the gaps of the previous G502. Hero is the perfect companion for all of your gaming needs. Let me get into each of them one by one. Don't miss the G HUB!Programmable Buttons: It features 11 buttons that are fully programmable. These include Forward/Backward, DPI Up/Down, G-Shift, Middle Click, Left/Right Click, Profile Cycle and Left/Right Scroll. Refer my image for visualization. Holding G-Shift in the default mode changes DPI to a preset which you can customize. For example, I hold it while snipping to lower my DPI to 1200 in FPS games and increase accuracy. Besides lowering the DPI, G-Shift button can also make existing buttons perform other functionality than their defaults. This gives you another set of 10 new controls! Yes, it does have horizontal scroll that enables left/right scrolling. I use it to change tabs in Chrome. Profile Cycle button helps me to cycle between different profiles easily. Not to miss that all of these are fully customizable on a per-app basis!Hyper Scroll: The scroll features as a frictionless one. Just scroll it once on a long webpage, leave it and it will keep scrolling even after you reach the end. Don't worry, you have a toggle just under it that can disable this feature.RGB: The space allotted is less. You can customize RGB settings for the Logo and the profile indicator on per-app basis. Choose modes between Cycle, Breathing, Fixed, Music and Screen. Music mode works as visualizer based on the playing track. Screen mode changes colour according to what's on your screen. For example, I have made profile for GRIS that makes my G502 to change colour to white and red depending on what's on left and middle side of the screen. The profile indicator in default mode helps you see the profile or DPI level when you change among the max 5.Weights: You get 5 3.6 grams weight bars that you can align in the weight compartment of the mouse as per your convenience. You have options for left/right and forward/backward alignments. A single weight can be aligned in 13 different ways! I've made a weight adjustment video so that you can see how weights are adjusted in G502.Grip and Durability: The mouse looks rock solid. If you have not too large hands, yours can rest comfortably over the mouse. There is a thumb rest while the curvature of the mouse is a treat to your right hand. Beware, left-handers!G HUB: The best thing about this mouse is the software. Yes, you read it right. With G HUB, you can make custom profiles (or even download from the community) for each app. Thus, you can change RGB colours and mode, buttons mapping, DPI settings and G-Shift/DPI-Shift for a particular app. I have even set a profile for Chrome that enhances my productivity. You can find profiles made by me on G HUB by the name 'Baahubali'. What amazed me is that besides Macros (Keyboard key combinations), Shortcuts and Keyboard Keys, you can even build scripts in Lua programming language - now this is something really professional by team.This was my first purchase of a premium gaming mouse. Previously, I had been buying Dragonwar mice. I read somewhere that this mouse is a one-time investment and now I believe they are right. Experiencing the hyper frictionless scroll gives you an idea about how reliable the mouse promises to be! With a price tag on 4K, it's a steal. You may get as minimum as INR 3799 in Lightning Deals.Do check my detailed photos and unboxing videos. I had to follow Amazon Video Format Specs so do visit YouTube (Paras Lehana) to view highest quality video of Unboxing and Weight Adjustment.\n"", '\n  I have been a gamer since my child and i was looking for a perfect gaming mouse and thats when i thought of this mouse just because it was on top of reviews and most importantly i was cheated by the name `logitech`.i have used a logitech mouse when i was a kid and that was really comfortable so i thought of going for logitech again and was really happy with the g502 hero because of its extreme control,precision and even accuracy and of course the comfort but only for 6 months.this was really a good mouse until it started to have double clicking issues.i probably think its the most cruel issue that a mouse can have.whenever i play pubg and i aim down the sight it automaticcaly double clicks resulting in total confusion.i lost many matches because of this.because u never aim when this issue starts.for atleast 1 in 4 hours i encounter this issue an i am totally tired of it.but to say the truth i really love this mouse except that one issue.how do u expect a high end mouse to have such issue that too within just 6 months of usage? really disappointed with logitech.\n', ""\n  The G502 Hero is an amazing mouse and for most people, it's a one time investment. The seller needs to understand that this is an expensive product. You need to put in a little bit more effort into packaging.I've been using this mouse for a while now and I'm loving the experience. I'd definitely recommend it!\n"", ""\n  \xa0Don't Buy Logitech mouse, just watch the video. There is big problem in  Logitech mouse switches, they are not good for gaming as there advertise, in just 6 months there are showing there ture cooler. Do some research before you buy any Logitech gaming mouse. There are so many videos available online showing the same problem and Logitech warranty service is very poor in India, there call center number is switched off. Then I try to contact they by email and that process is again big headache. So before buying this kind of expensive mouse just watch the video actually there is big hardware problem, you can't hold your right click for long time. Watch the video\n"", ""\n  This mouse is actually fantastic for me, except for one TERRIBLE FLAW.  First the good - it's sleek, the sensor is amazing, it feels bonkers great in the hand, and the thumb buttons are very well positioned.  I kept reading a lot of things about the scroll wheel, but I didn't find it distracting at all.  I can't really see a use for free-scrolling, but the standard incremental scrolling works quite well.Now, for the bad.  The TILT WHEEL FUNCTIONALITY is absolutely useless if you are thinking of re-mapping the tilt buttons.  The slightest, most minimal application of pressure to the scroll wheel will often trigger the tilt buttons.  I repeat - if you use mouse button 3, you will FREQUENTLY trigger tilt left and right.  This means the tilt wheel is useless if you plan to re-map the tilt buttons (which I personally always do).  So, if you are never going to change the tilt wheel mapping - great mouse!  Fantastic deal!  If you don't want to be moving backwards and forwards in your browser every time you mouse 3, or want to re-map the tilt buttons - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOUSE.  COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY\n""]"

Installing the mouse driver and software made the difference between a good mouse and a highly customizable one. The link\'s listed many times under this page\'s Q&As. This mouse is great for working on spreadsheets, editing, mindless copy/pasting, because its programmable buttons allow for macro programming (See image).The middle rolling button and the two arrow-looking buttons behind it are programmable in addition to the two on the left side.Mouse sensitivity is adjusted on the app\'s Main Settings page. For more control there\'s 5 DPI setting that can be adjusted under the ""Advanced"" menu. It\'s only adjustable by moving the sliding bar at certain increments: 500, 750, 1000, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2400, 3000, 3200, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000, 7200.

So far just from build and ease of use, I do really like it. The biggest set back I had first encountered when setting the mouse up was downloading the software used primarily for the lighting. The mouse itself was plug & play, I had no issue at all there. The mouse came in a bland little brown box, with instructions to a (Korean?) website to download the previously mentioned software. All of which I am perfectly fine with. Using Google translate built into my browser made it simple enough. To my surprise though, the day after I received email from the seller with a direct link to the correct software for the mouse. That was unexpected yet appreciated. It would have been nicer a day earlier, but to be fair the mouse came extremely quick. Quicker than I expected. The lighting on the mouse is pretty good. The software to customize is fairly simple and limited, but on a budget gives you quite a bit. All the colors are vibrant, and the transitions are nice as well. The mouse also has a good weight to it. Neither to heavy or light so not to feel cheap or give you wrist strain from movement. All button functions work perfectly for me. With layout customization as well. Which I honestly use very little. I am mostly fine with the default configuration.I leave 4-stars for now cause it is the ""I Like"" option. That\'s where I sit as of now. I will see how the mouse holds up over some time. If all is good I will update my star rating good or bad. Being new and a product I am unfamiliar with I think this is the fairest review I can give. Till later then,,,,,,\n', '\n  Love it so far. Is this for the super-hard-core gamer? Maybe, but more than likely not. If you are in that category of gamer, you\'ll likely be super fussy about your mouse and what it can and cannot do. Like you\'ll likely want to customize the weight of the mouse, have replaceable slides, and have more buttons than you have fingers...if that\'s your mouse that\'s cool and more power to you for your gaming proclivities.I bought this mouse on a whim and because it seems like a bargain. So far, it has been fantastic and I love it. Okay the mouse doesn\'t have replaceable slides or weight customization and it doesn\'t have more buttons than it needs to be pretty decent for the gaming I do.What I like:1. It is lightweight and slides almost like liquid helium on my gaming surface (okay maybe not that awesome, but it is pretty darn slick).2. buttons are ergonomically placed and responsive to the touch (oh yeah...responsive to the touch)...3. DPI setting is pretty customizable (see images attached to this review). You can customize 5 DPI settings from 500DPI to 7500DPI (in 100DPI increments) and select a completely custom color for each DPI setting (including if you want the light to ""breath"" or be steady). I\'m not sure I have need for DPI setting that is that wide in range. For my gaming needs I use 1000DPI for my FPS games and when I\'m just using other windows use a 1200-1500DPI setting so I can get around the monitor efficiently.4. Price - for sure price will fluctuate online from this review. so I won\'t put the specific price I paid for this mouse, but I found it to be an incredible bargain for the price.5. It does have the capacity to record macros, so that is cool, but I have not specific need at the moment so that is unevaluated.So far - a very solid 5-star review with a recommendation for intermediate gamers.Game on!\n', '\n  Excellent mouse, feels great to hold and is awesome for its DPI and color customization.I did notice, however, that the pads on the bottom are slightly scratched and peeled up. Despite how this could cause friction, the mouse still feels smooth to move. I’ve added a picture of the damaged bottom pads below to this comment.Edit: I was mistaken about the bottom pads being peeled. That was actually protective plastic covering which was meant to be peeled, though it still might be worth mentioning that the plastic covering came damaged. The actual mouse pads under the plastic work quite well.Also, the mouse cursor does move slightly when you pick up and move the mouse around, so if you want to reposition your mouse during gaming, you may need to raise the mouse about half an inch every time you do so.\n', '\n  me ha resultado excelente, tenía un logitech pero se me cayó y fue perdida total.

No longer do I play World of Warcraft like a job, raiding hardcore for 40+ hours a week and selling Challenge Mode carries on the side. If you don’t understand what I’m talking about, let me explain.I have used this mouse for FIVE. YEARS. DAILY. I have spilled coffee on this mouse, Monster energy drinks on this mouse, water on this mouse; this mouse swam every day as if it lived in a luxury hot tub but it was really just my desk.This is a gaming mouse, yes, but as a gamer let me just tell you that there’s a difference between “gaming” hardware and then gaming hardware that actually delivers and is built to last for what you’re doing.I’m not talking about logging in on League of Legends or Overwatch once or twice a week. I’m not talking about Call of Duty, Fortnite, or whatever everyone’s into these days. I’m talking about using this mouse constantly for a minimum of 8 hours per day, every day, 5-7 days a week. For years. This mouse was built to LAST.I’ve had about 3 of these mice in this timespan. Not because they broke; they NEVER did. It’s just that after you own anything for more than a few years, especially after spilling various drinks on it, it just gets junky after a while. (You know...finger grease, bent cords, etc). I replaced this mouse on my own accord when I felt like treating myself - NEVER because I “had to”. Because I didn’t.I don’t endorse many things in my life, but so help me, if you need a dependable mouse that you can rely on for years, THIS. IS. IT. 👏🏻.I now live in my house with my boyfriend (whom I met off WoW... I know, yikes) and though we no longer competitively play games anymore, we still use this mouse for our computers. My entire life has gone into its next chapter and one of the only consistent factors in it has been this mouse. That’s wild.My friends (guildies) have all gotten married and had kids, I’m still flying out to another one’s wedding later this year, so much of our lives have changed in incomprehensible ways. But Logitech never changed what they did, and I guess I’m not only reviewing this product but also thanking them for creating such a simple item that gives me so many fantastic memories. Again, it’s a mouse. That’s wild.Anyway, thanks for reading. I gotta represent the brands I trust, you know? I hope you enjoy this product as much as I did, and continue to. Cheers.\n', ""\n  So this replaced the mouse every one says ripped this G600 mouse off, and yeah I can see that, but both are really good gaming mouses, getting this one after three or so years of use of the venus, left click started to loose its click hold, it would of been a easy fix but decided I wanted something new, and as for the G600 compared?Well it is the better mouse in my opinion, but not by much so if you don't want to spend as much, the Venus is perfectly fine and well worth the money, where the G600 is better is quality, the parts do feel like they'll last longer,I like the ring finger extra button over the to the left of the left click mouse button on the Venus mouse, one thing I was worried about switching to the G600, is that I like my gaming mouses heavy, I used all the weights in the Venus gaming mouse, thankfully the G600 is as heavy or barely noticeably lighter then the Venus mouse,Really the only thing I liked the Venus mouse more over the G600, is the size, I have large hands, glove size large some times are a little tight but that should give you an idea, anyways, the utechsmart venus mouse is slightly larger then the G600, it also has a thumb rest which I like but because the G600 is smaller, my palm doesn't rest as much on the G600, making my wrist rest more so on the mouse pad which can be uncomfortable, but raising my chair fixed that.Was it worth the price difference? mmm, at this moment it being $3, sure, though $39 is still pretty high for a gaming mouse, heh unless your a Razor fan boy, anyways, I'm happy with my purchase, though we'll see if the G600 lasts as long as the Utechsmart Venus mouse.\n"", '\n  I wanted to love this mouse. It feels great in hand and when it works it is amazing. Problem is that the software it uses is from 2013 and there are many bugs with it. In my case if I set a button up to use G it works for 30 mins and then stops working till i turn off the computer. You might ask “well isnt that a defective product then?” Technically yes but if I change that same button to work with H then it will work for another 30 mins then stop. I have contacted logitech email support and recieved an email saying “we are working to change our customer support please email back to this email or your case will be closed”. So i email back and big surprise my case was closed the next day. I then call amazon support who gives me their support number. I call it and tell them my problem. Im told to wait while im transfered to a different rep. After 5 mins I got hung up on without talking to the other rep. Less than 5 mins later I already had my return label printed.I wanted to love this mouse as it feels and looks great, but the support and the constant problems ruined it for me. Maybe if they fixed the software that was last updated in 2013 the mouse would actually work.\n', '\n  I\'m done with Logitech. I can say with certitude that their products have either or both: planned obsolescence (some components are MEANT to fail after X years or X uses) AND pre-programmed obsolescence (something written directly on the chips of those products to ""fake"" button failure) pretty much ALL my logitech products of the last 10-12 years have lasted 2-3 years before failing mysteriously. My G600 just broke this morning, after 3 years: the top button stopped working for no obvious reason (i still hear ""click"" noise when i press on it so the dome must be working). 3 months before that, my 250$ G910 started ""double-typing"" keys for no reason, and seemingly at RANDOM (not the most used keys) after... you guessed it... almost exactly 3 years. My G700 before that did the SAME thing... wait for it... after 3 years of use. And.... so did my G13 keypad too.... after.... 3 ********* years. This is no coincidence. In 10 years i\'ve probably bought like 10 or 11 peripherals (keyboards, mice, keypads, etc) and all of them high-end, and NONE lasted beyond 3 years. Now some people would say ""that\'s normal wear and tear"" or ""just buy another one"" but hell no. In the 90s and early 2000s i NEVER remember a keyboard or mouse failing on me (except for the balls of mice getting dirty, which could be cleaned). Logitech is a deceptive company, STAY AWAY from them.\n', '\n  I’m on my third of these now. The first I dropped one too many times. The second got clogged with cat fur (she insists on climbing on my mouse mat), although there are instructions on how to clean it online I didn’t want to attempt it without a working backup in case I made things worse. The third is as flawless as the first two were when I got them.This is peerless in terms of multi-button mice. Lighter than you might expect, the mouse is easy to use and fits well to the shape of the palm.The real star here though is the button layout on the side. Logitech paid a lot of attention to make sure the buttons are easy to identify just by touch. Other mice have buttons that all feel the same, but the M600 has them set in 2 concave groups, so your thumb sits comfortably in the little concave depression of each, making it very easy to tell between the buttons. There’s no chance you’ll accidentally press the wrong one because you can immediately feel which one you’re touching.Sadly Logitech don’t make this anymore and haven’t replaced it with a similar updated version. There’s nothing on the current market that comes close to this.\n', '\n  Ok, So... This mouse is great but has some down sides I will just do pros and cons.PROS:1. Over 20 programmable buttons2. Adjustable DPI3. G-Setting is wicked.4. Light weightCONS:1. When you push a macro button there is no indication if the macro is active or not.. (This should be able to be set with the lighting effects but isnt possible.) 2. The thumb buttons are very sensitive so its very easy to accidentally push one of them.. the bad thing about this is if you have multiple macros set to multiple buttons it can be EXTREMELY difficult to see what button is active to turn the macro off. (basically related to issue #1)3. The mouse is Ergonomic but that being said because of its size it can become slightly uncomfortable after time.Other then the 3 small issues its a great gaming mouse.\n', '\n  . . . that I have ever had IMO. I am on my second one now and I have bought another one as a replacement when this one dies [R I P ].The first one lasted 2 1/2 years being used for up to 10 hours a day . . . the second one has been in use for 3 1/2 years of daily punishment.The best gaming mouse for MMO [Guild Wars 2 ] - my kill rate and survival went way up when I learned where the buttons were :)\n', '\n  i checked the mouse some time after purchase and its not working properly, one key is like constantly pressed and few other doesnt work at all, i had the same before but i guess i just got a faulty one now\n']"

Been a 15 year deathadder user. Razer's products have grown cheap. So cheap that I absolutely refuse to buy any more razer products.  My first generation Razer deathadder, which still works, lasted 12 years before I bought a newer edition. The newer editions of the deathadder I have purchased both stopped working for me after about 2 or 3 years. I did a little mouse-searchin and found the Roccat Kone AIMO, bought it and fell in love with it.Never goin back!______________________________________________________________________________________________________That was my first and original review. Since then, it has been a little over 3 months since the original post and now I completely backpedal on my original review. This mouse wheel has died on me. Roccat customer service has been a joke and they refuse to answer, after their original first answer to uninstall the software and reinstall it (which I had).Since then I have come back and downgraded this garbage mouse and COMPLETELY refuse to purchase anything from this company ever again. It's a crap company who won't even honor their failed junk mouse. It won't even last you a year guaranteed. As I said before, never goin back and I am NEVER going back to ROCCAT. Crap company that deserves to fail. They can't even return a faulty mouse.Straight Garbage.\n"", ""\n  So much to say I was very skeptical about purchasing this mouse because if was from Roccat of which whom I have no experience with but in my quest to find my mouse I believe I have found it to my surprise and excitement.Pros:1) SIZE: First things first the size of the mouse is a little of the larger type I would not reccomend it if you have small hands at all but for medium to large hands with a palm grip you may be at home. For small hands I'd reccomend the g502.2) BUTTONS:  the buttons feel outstanding and of top quality. Every single time I press the mouse buttons to include the T3 button on the side button they feel great and responsive. I had my skepticism about that T3 button but it works extremely well especially since you can press the main mouse button and the T3 simultaneously because they somewhat oppose one another. Pressing the main mouse button while at the same time pressing a side button always presented somewhat of a challenge for me but not anymore.3) SENSOR: The Owl Eye sensor is a beast hands down, I am not a sniper so I usually limit my firefights to close quarters typically because I've had issues keeping the scope steady at longer distances well thanks to Roccat and the owl eye I'm able to track my targets tremendously better and when I tell you that this things doesn't move when I reposition the mouse, it's almost as if I didn't even lift it off of the pad at all it's that good.4) SOFTWARE: What can I say again very impressed, the software is wonderful once you learn how to navigate it, it's a thing of beauty the interface is different there is a slight learning curve but it interacts with the mouse EVERY TIME (looking at you iCue) and provides a plethora of customizable options I cannot complain.OVERALL: I really have nothing bad to say about this mouse I mean it's not perfect but for me it comes pretty close. I have large hands and a palm style grip and if you have the same I'd encourage you to do yourself a favor if you're in the market for a new mouse and try it out.\n"", '\n  Do not buy this product.I advised my SO to get a Logitech G502 but she liked the look of this one so we tried it. Installing the software is a pain... why are the necessary modules not already linked to the mouse?So I have to install the program, then it hangs on ""Please install the Aimo module via the auto-update""Auto-update detects no updates.I find a reddit post as the top result saying that this has been an ongoing problem for TWO YEARS.One user suggested checking the ""Offline Update"" option.Doing so has bricked the laptop.Currently doing a clean install of windows.As of now laptop starts and the caps lock key flashes repeatedly with nothing being displayed on screen.Again,DONOTBUY\n', '\n  Bei der ersten Maus scrollte nach einem Monat das Mausrad nicht mehr richtig in eine Richtung.Umtausch war kein Problem.Die zweite Maus hielt nun 4 Monate und das selbe Problem tritt auf. Natürlich kann ich sie jetzt nicht mehr umtauschen.Sehr schade scheint wohl auch ein häufig vorkommendes Problem zu sein.Tolle Maus, aber mit dem Hersteller-Fehler nicht akzeptabel..\n', '\n  I bought this mouse as it was recomended for large hands and it performed brillianty for the first couple of weeks. Unfortunately, the scroll wheel then started to malfunction jumping in the opposite direction to which I was scrolling. This is a definite dealbreaker as scrolling is quite a major function for a mouse and after doing some research this appears to be a common issue with the mouse. This is a real shame given how much I like it otherwise.\n', '\n  This mouse feels great, looks great and works great. I love the layout and pretty much everything about it.My issue is a MASSIVE one in that I paid around £50 for this mouse only for the mouse to start double-clicking every time I press the mouse button. I expected something like this to happen eventually, but this happened within only 3 months and I can\'t even get a refund because I didn\'t pay the extortionate extra £15 for accidental damage insurance.I\'m not in a position to buy a new mouse and my mouse is defective after 3 months despite my paying £50 for it. After reading online, ROCCAT apparently knowingly use cheap switches under the mouse buttons leaving around 50,000 clicks before they start breaking down (for use as a gaming mouse, 50,000 clicks is nothing). My best guess is that they do this in hopes that people will keep buying replacements, or pay extra for damage insurance as a way to make an extra buck.Otherwise this mouse is great, it\'s comfortable, usable and has really great features on it that make it great, but I can NOT in good conscience recommend anyone to buy this mouse or it\'s non-""remastered"" predecessor. A shame seeing as one of the selling points for this mouse is \'Enhanced Durability\' and yet it lasted less time than the last one.Do not be tempted by the features of this mouse. Stay away or you\'ll be in the same position I am in right now with a very defective mouse and having lost a not insignificant amount of money to a corporation who doesn\'t make their products to last.\n', ""\n  I upgraded to this mouse from a Khone XTD as it was getting old and wearing away, I had it for 5years+ without any issues. I trust ROCCAT® products. This mouse feels superior to that mouse in every aspect. The size of the mouse is perfect for me as I have quite big hands and it's a pretty large mouse. The weight of the mouse really helps when I'm tracking targets in FPS games, such as apex, or warzone etc. The scroll wheel has a really nice feel to it, it's really smooth when you roll it. LMB and RMB are both pretty sensitive, but that's how I like it. The mouse RBG looks great, its really nice and bright, but not too bright where it becomes distracting. The software is nice and easy to use, it's really easy to make macros with this mouse, for what ever you need them for. I love how the mouse feels, so silky smooth... it's a pleasure to hold it. Overall a top quality feeling mouse that works absolutely perfectly. I also bought the ROCCAT® Horde AIMO keyboard, so I could sync the RBG between them and they share the same software. Overall I am super pleased with this mouse and think it was definitely worth the money.\n"", ""\n  The Kone Aimo is comfortably broad, and while still too small to allow for a palm grip comfortably (the tips of my fingers end up off the front of the mouse if it's in my palm), but I can at least rest my finger along with the mouse in full which has been a great help.Software seems good and isn't wasting resources.Build quality feels good.Not sure I like the shift key, it's a little too light on the switch and easy to press, but that's really minor and I'm sure I'll get used to it.Upgraded from a Logitech G502 after it felt like it was exacerbating RSI issues due to its small size and tall resting height.\n""]"
