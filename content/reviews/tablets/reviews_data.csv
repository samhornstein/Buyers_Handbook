Yes its plastic, yes its screen is only 1900x1200, yes its Media Tek processor is not the top processor available today, yes it ONLY has 2GB of ram.  However your stupid if you feel like this is a letdown, after all most of this information can be found right on the page to purchase the tablet.Here is the deal with this tablet.- I bought it to watch and consume Prime video, Netflix video, (maybe someday put the google store on it for youtube (but even now i can go to youtube on the silk browser and it works perfectly fine)- I play light games, but its able to play what I play without problem.- I do not feel i need to baby this tablet because I only paid 180 bucks for it (64GB not 32) in fact i got two HD8\'s and this HD10 for me for less than my wife\'s IPAD.  So if they break it.. im not out 300 bucks-Being a network engineer this is my get away from computers without getting away.  I have zero productivity apps on it (which i like) I have zero communication apps on it (which I like), This tablet for me is a way to get away from life.  I have a phone for talking, and work, and teams, and slack.Dont kid yourself, this is not a high end tablet.  These one star reviews needs to take a better look at themselves and understand  you get what you pay for.  And for me, this absoutley works for what i need it to do.  And i dont feel like crap if i drop it and break it.why not five star.  Speakers are not great, again get what you pay for... which to me is not a big deal... i would of only taken a half a star off for them if I could.\n', ""\n  Why was my initial review removed?I was about the update my previous 5-star good review with the following only to find my video + photo review was removed!However I discovered that there's around 10% battery drain daily, probably due to the ads on lock screen, even when airplane mode is turned on (wifi off)!I lose almost 70% to 80% charge in about a week!I am aware there's an option to pay to get rid of the ads,but the lock screen ads even consumes so much power on standby just doesn't make any sense to me.I don't mind seeing the ads. Couldn't this be optimized better?I'm now quite upset and decided to return it, for the poorly designed software that drains battery and my deleted review by amazon!\n"", '\n  9/22/20 - Tablet died yesterday. Still under warranty.NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I\'d drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I\'ve now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I\'ve done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That\'s absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can\'t be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I\'ve had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you\'re still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I\'m going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon\'s smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon\'s current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon\'s decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don\'t work in the technology sector so I don\'t have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn\'t produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer\'s budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX\'s 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I\'ve pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I\'d often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It\'s fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt\'s a $150 - $200 device. Don\'t expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don\'t matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it\'s large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don\'t much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI\'m not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You\'d have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI\'ve not installed a microSD card, so I can\'t evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung\'s ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don\'t understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there\'s something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you\'ve never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon\'s interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I\'m a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I\'ve spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it\'s an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can\'t open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I\'m pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I\'m sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it\'s not as if I\'m asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model\'s erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don\'t own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won\'t be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn\'t an Amazon issue. Just King\'s way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There\'s no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon\'s store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I\'ve been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter\'s built-in browser (as I\'ve done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I\'ve changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn\'t fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven\'t yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don\'t care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you\'re likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon\'s own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn\'t remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I\'ve also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google\'s store vs. from Amazon\'s.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google\'s Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I\'ve not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google\'s play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon\'s digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn\'t You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON\'S BROWSERAmazon\'s first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon\'s first browser, but it wasn\'t as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don\'t want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can\'t sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon\'s own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won\'t go into the entire sordid history around Amazon\'s ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won\'t show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn\'t want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn\'t even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn\'t even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don\'t open up the Files folder and look for them. They won\'t be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I\'ve gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn\'t get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don\'t expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don\'t count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you\'ve never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you\'re thinking of switching from some other company\'s tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I\'ve addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I\'m not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I\'ve had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn\'t it.HDX owners: we\'re still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.\n', ""\n  The tablet is awesome! it is really fast and it is really smooth. I have the Fire HD 8 and it's not nearly as fast or smooth at this tablet. Plus with the Anker Type C PD charger, I've been able to charge this tablet at 16 watts! Fast charging, type c, faster wifi, faster processor, and etc... this tablet is a steal at 149 dollars!\n"", '\n  We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware?

I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 – 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 –8th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the “Saving Money on Purchases” section).This device is Amazon’s most recently refreshed (2019 – 9th generation) Fire tablet 7 inch at an outstanding price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is definitely slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are really tough to beat and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations.Below is my summary of the “Fire 7.” I have spent the past few days playing around with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review has overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience.-THE BOX: The Fire 7 tablet, a quick-start guide, basic safety instructions, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.- AVAILABILITY: Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage are the base colors variants. Additionally, covers can be purchased for $29.99 in the same color scheme as the Fire tablet from Amazon. Personally, I wouldn’t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other high quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better.- Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 model:--- Display size remains the same--- PPI remains the same at 171--- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM.--- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone)--- Size specifications remain the same--- Warranty remains the same (90-day limited warranty)- Summary of key aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017.---  Fire 2019: Increased storage options (16 GB or 32 GB) as compared to prior version Fire 2017 (8 GB or 16 GB).--- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from prior version.--- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019). This is a major plus because it would take forever to charge these tablets). Again, please note that this claim (regarding charging time) holds true only if an Amazon wall outlet is used. The tablet usually notifies you when you are using a non-compatible wall outlet and cable. I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging.--- The new processor based on specs provided by Amazon to developers Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 (1.3 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A7 (1.3 GHz)] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available.--- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version.--- Slight decrease in weight (0.3 oz/9 grams)--- Light sensor added (mentioned in developer information page).--- Three new colors added (Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage) in addition to Black.- Technical specs and other details:--- Size: 7.6” x 4.5” x 0.4” (192 x 115 x 9.6 mm).--- 171 pixel per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter. This basically means that there is a bright display with vivid colors and whiter whites for a great viewing experience from all angles.--- 7-inch screen, 1024 x 600 resolution with SD video playback--- Internal Storage: 16 or 32 GB--- External Storage: expandable storage using MicroSD card for up to 512 GB + unlimited cloud storage for Amazon digital content purchases.--- Weight: 10.1 oz/286 grams--- Amazon’s digital assistant: Hands-free Alexa enabled. This option basically converts the device into a stand-alone device that can do multiple functions. For instance, if you are cooking and want help, you can ask Alexa to pull up the instructions for “Mashed Potatoes” and it will do so.--- Warranty and Service: 90-day limited warranty and service included. U.S. customers can purchase an extended warranty for 1, 2 or 3 years (though I might not personally recommend this for such an affordable product like the Fire 7)--- Camera: 2MP VGA front-facing camera and rear-facing HD camera--- Sensors: Accelerometer and light sensor--- Battery life: Up to 7 hours of battery life--- Fully charges in 4 hours (if Amazon wall outlet is used)--- Single-antenna dual-band Wi-Fi.

Since, this is for a different audience, I will not deal with it in this review.- Comparison between Fire 7 (this version – 2019 release) and Fire HD 8 (2018 release – mid-tier model):--- Charge time: Fire HD 8 (6 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours)--- Display Size: Fire HD 8 (8 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches)--- Video playback: Fire HD 8 (HD video playback) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback)--- Resolution: Fire HD 8 (1280 * 800; 189 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI)--- RAM: Fire HD 8 (1.5 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM)--- Battery life: Fire HD 8 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours),--- Speaker: Fire HD 8 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker)--- Weight: Fire HD 8 (12.8 oz, 363 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g)--- Expandable Storage (internal storage remains same): Fire HD 8 (expandable by to 400 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB).--- Colors: Fire HD 8 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red, Canary Yellow) vs..

Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage)--- Cost: Fire HD 10 (32 GB - $149.99; 32 GB - $189.99) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99)--- Multi-touch: Fire HD 10 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)** If you are considering buying the Fire HD 10, I would wait on it as there is a high probability that this model will be refreshed this year as the last update was in 2017 (Amazon seems to follow a 2-year refresh cycle though this is not always the case).- Some useful features on Fire Tablets (not a comprehensive list)--- Accessibility: “VoiceView and Screen Magnifier enable access to the vast majority of Fire tablet features. VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.”--- Surfing the web using Amazon’s web browser - Silk--- Watching movies, TV shows and listening to music.--- Ability to read Kindle books.--- Ability to read the news using Washington Times--- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon’s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.--- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc.--- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store.- Testing:Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.- Saving money on purchasing the Fire:--- For users who want more storage, I would strongly recommend getting the Fire 7 (16 GB) and then purchasing a microSD card as opposed to getting the costlier Fire 7 (32 GB tablet). For context, users can get a 64 GB microSD card for around $12 (users might be able to get a cheaper microSD card on Amazon prime day) on Amazon which is cheaper than paying an additional $20 for Fire 7 32 GB. Additionally, the user gets more storage by getting a microSD card.--- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles the user to a ($10 app store credit value), so you are essentially paying $ 39.99 for the 16 GB Fire 7 tablet.--- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $49.99 (with special offers) or 32 GB Fire 7 for $69.99 (with special offers). Customers can disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Fire with special offers. Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 devices, all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the Fire with special offers and then remove the special offers..--- You can easily trade-in your prior Fire for Amazon credit (for $5-$15 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire.--- As previously mentioned, I would recommend avoiding purchasing extended warranty on this item.--- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.-Quality comment: Some customers have critiqued the prior version (Fire 7: 2017) for lack of long-term quality. Again, please remember that this product is sold for $49.99 and goes on sale for around $ 29.99. How much more can one expect for a product this affordable? I have used my prior Fire 7 (2015) for 4 years without any issues (Honestly, I am surprised it lasted this long). Additionally, it definitely is more durable than my iPad. Additionally, with the immense technological breakthroughs occurring at lightening speed, any tablet will be obsolete in a few years. So, it might be logically better to get an affordable average end tablet than investing in a high end one (unless you need a high-end one for your specific use).- Conclusion:To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, and potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, and basic app store.  Updates worth noting in this version include the new color options, a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and can complete most of the basic and some intermediate tasks along with basic entertainment, then this Fire tablet is the way to go. So, I am giving it 5/5 stars in spite of its limitations because it is really hard (if not impossible) to find a better deal at this price point.- UPDATE # 1 (June 10, 2019): Fire HD 8I would personally recommend the Fire HD 8 (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB vs. 1 GB), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the feature I appreciate the most - Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I own both the 7 and the 8 inch, and there is a spectacular difference in sound quality and volume between the two. Besides, most phones now have an average screen size of around 5.5 inches (many companies are moving towards a 6 inches average). So, having a 7-inch tablet might not per se make a major difference for customers because it is similar in size to their phone (unless they want to use this device as a back-up device to prevent wear and tear on their phone). Additionally, since charging takes a substantial amount of time, I would rather have a tablet with longer battery life (Fire HD 8) than shorter (Fire 7). However, please note that the last argument cuts both ways as the new Fire 7 (4 hours) charges quicker as compared to the Fire HD 8 (6 hours).- UPDATE # 2 (June 15, 2019): Amazon FreeTime Unlimited- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited ($2.99/month after free subscription period)--- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over “20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids' profiles to give them more access to apps and games.” “In FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.” Another unique feature is Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish!--- Parents also have the option “to set educational goals and curfews (using FreeTime Unlimited), and manage content for up to 4 child profiles (option given during initial set-up of the tablet) with easy-to-use parental controls.”--- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers unbeatable value – I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after trial subscription ends).*FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time.UPDATE # 3 (June 21, 2019):  Battery Life and SoftwareSome customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I have experienced occasional battery fluctuations (my prior Fire seemed to have better battery life). So, I am docking a star. Some other reviewers have also experienced overheating of this device. Other than the occasional overheating that occur in all devices (when complex programs/apps are used for an extended period of time), I haven’t experienced anything major until now. Additionally, some customers have also complained about the new Fire OS causing problems. I have experienced occasional staggering of the OS and app closures but nothing major as described by other reviewers. I will continue my testing to see if other issues surface but just wanted to give a heads-up to customers so they are prepared in case they experience any issues in the future and want to contact Amazon about it.Please also note several resources were used in the compilation of this review but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review. If you have any feedback or questions or corrections, leave a note in the comments section. Thank you!\n"", '\n  I having been buying the smaller Fire tablets (7 inch) since the beginning and I can now recommend to buy this tablet. I have other sized Fire tablets (8 Inch) and a new ipad, plus the new Kindle paper white, but the Fire 7 is my go to tablet. What I use it for. Prime Video, Hulu, Netflix, Youtube.  Kindle reader for books and bible. Audible books from audible. Podcasts (stitcher). Comixology for comics (old school Marvel fan!). Instagram (I do not use facebook). Home automation with Alexa (control of my lights, ring alarm, alarms, and basic questions) works great both hands free as well as pressing the home button.  I also play light games on it, Word search, Temple run, Angry Birds series of games, Yahtzee, Subway Surfer, Crossy Roads, and a few others.  I also listen to Amazon prime music (Apple music does not work on this device).  I mainly use my Apple air buds when watching and listening and it sounds fantastic.  Picture quality is great.  This is a snappy little tablet and my favorite size.  It feels good in the hand with the solid plastic build (compared to the Fire 8 inch, which feels more ""cheap""). It is a great tablet to use while lying in bed, which is mainly when I use it (ipad 9.7 is to heavy). I feel that Amazon finally got it right with this new 2019 version. The previous versions are painfully slow to load anything, and that is why I never would recommend them especially for a child.  These new tablets are so much better, my wife wants one, and I will be buying them for my kids, something I would not even consider before, because of the frustration of the slowness (and the reason my kids took over the ipad and iphones in the first place).  As you can see this is a consumption device, meant for fun..not a computer or workhorse.  I should mention you can check email and use the tablet for video chatting and dropping in on other echo devices which works really well and my kids have fun using it, I should also mention that I am a Prime member and take advantage of the Prime photo storage, which any picture that I take on my iphone, pops up on my Fire Tablet. I should also mention why I use this for reading more than my paper white, it is because I like the ""page curl effect"" and the way it highlights my passages on books (I still use my paper white..but this is just a preference). The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the 2mp camera (which I do not use much) and the battery life, which is actually not bad, but Amazon asked for a ""star"" rating on those two features as well as tablet as a whole.  At $50 you can not go wrong. Plus if you have a previous version, just trade it in. I got $10 knocked off and an additional 20% savings. I think I paid about $33.  I will be trading in my 8 inch Fire for this size as well.  Great little tablet!\n', ""\n  This kindle worked well for a few hours and then all of a sudden it started to search the internet on it's own.  This is for my 8 year old daughter because her old kindle was not working.  This kindle really scared my child.  She would play a game and something would control the game.  We would watch it change the settings on it's own and move from ap to ap.  When the kindle was locked something kept trying to access my contacts, and unlock my kindle!!  It would change the time and change to a different alarm.  I contacted amazon and they were not helpful, because nothing worked..  I had to factory restart it twice and it kept going back to controling itself on it's own.  Finally I just had to return it because it because there was no way to use it.  Amazon needs to make a product that works.\n"", '\n  Good budget tablet but the battery drains continuously when idle at a fast rate (10% daily)\n', ""\n  I'm not a fan. It doesn't hold an internet connection well AT ALL and I hate how limited the device is. I'm sure it's mostly my fault for not reading that the fire tablets are only exclusive to Amazon apps so you can't use any apps from Google play or anything, but in the part of the description I read it said games. I didn't realize it didn't include Google play games. Unfortunately that was my reason for getting a tablet, so I will be returning mine and getting something with Google play services. If you are okay with only watching movies, TV and reading, this may be okay for you. Not sure about the internet connection though, my boyfriend's tablet (Lenovo) doesn't do that.\n""]"

I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 – 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 –8th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the “Saving Money on Purchases” section).This device is Amazon’s most recently refreshed (2019 – 9th generation) Fire tablet 7 inch at an outstanding price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is definitely slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are really tough to beat and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations.Below is my summary of the “Fire 7.” I have spent the past few days playing around with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review has overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience.-THE BOX: The Fire 7 tablet, a quick-start guide, basic safety instructions, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.- AVAILABILITY: Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage are the base colors variants. Additionally, covers can be purchased for $29.99 in the same color scheme as the Fire tablet from Amazon. Personally, I wouldn’t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other high quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better.- Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 model:--- Display size remains the same--- PPI remains the same at 171--- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM.--- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone)--- Size specifications remain the same--- Warranty remains the same (90-day limited warranty)- Summary of key aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017.---  Fire 2019: Increased storage options (16 GB or 32 GB) as compared to prior version Fire 2017 (8 GB or 16 GB).--- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from prior version.--- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019). This is a major plus because it would take forever to charge these tablets). Again, please note that this claim (regarding charging time) holds true only if an Amazon wall outlet is used. The tablet usually notifies you when you are using a non-compatible wall outlet and cable. I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging.--- The new processor based on specs provided by Amazon to developers Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 (1.3 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A7 (1.3 GHz)] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available.--- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version.--- Slight decrease in weight (0.3 oz/9 grams)--- Light sensor added (mentioned in developer information page).--- Three new colors added (Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage) in addition to Black.- Technical specs and other details:--- Size: 7.6” x 4.5” x 0.4” (192 x 115 x 9.6 mm).--- 171 pixel per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter.

This option basically converts the device into a stand-alone device that can do multiple functions.

VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.”--- Surfing the web using Amazon’s web browser - Silk--- Watching movies, TV shows and listening to music.--- Ability to read Kindle books.--- Ability to read the news using Washington Times--- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon’s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.--- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc.--- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store.- Testing:Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.- Saving money on purchasing the Fire:--- For users who want more storage, I would strongly recommend getting the Fire 7 (16 GB) and then purchasing a microSD card as opposed to getting the costlier Fire 7 (32 GB tablet). For context, users can get a 64 GB microSD card for around $12 (users might be able to get a cheaper microSD card on Amazon prime day) on Amazon which is cheaper than paying an additional $20 for Fire 7 32 GB. Additionally, the user gets more storage by getting a microSD card.--- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles the user to a ($10 app store credit value), so you are essentially paying $ 39.99 for the 16 GB Fire 7 tablet.--- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $49.99 (with special offers) or 32 GB Fire 7 for $69.99 (with special offers). Customers can disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Fire with special offers. Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 devices, all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the Fire with special offers and then remove the special offers..--- You can easily trade-in your prior Fire for Amazon credit (for $5-$15 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire.--- As previously mentioned, I would recommend avoiding purchasing extended warranty on this item.--- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.-Quality comment: Some customers have critiqued the prior version (Fire 7: 2017) for lack of long-term quality. Again, please remember that this product is sold for $49.99 and goes on sale for around $ 29.99. How much more can one expect for a product this affordable? I have used my prior Fire 7 (2015) for 4 years without any issues (Honestly, I am surprised it lasted this long). Additionally, it definitely is more durable than my iPad. Additionally, with the immense technological breakthroughs occurring at lightening speed, any tablet will be obsolete in a few years. So, it might be logically better to get an affordable average end tablet than investing in a high end one (unless you need a high-end one for your specific use).- Conclusion:To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, and potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, and basic app store.  Updates worth noting in this version include the new color options, a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and can complete most of the basic and some intermediate tasks along with basic entertainment, then this Fire tablet is the way to go. So, I am giving it 5/5 stars in spite of its limitations because it is really hard (if not impossible) to find a better deal at this price point.- UPDATE # 1 (June 10, 2019): Fire HD 8I would personally recommend the Fire HD 8 (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB vs. 1 GB), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the feature I appreciate the most - Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I own both the 7 and the 8 inch, and there is a spectacular difference in sound quality and volume between the two. Besides, most phones now have an average screen size of around 5.5 inches (many companies are moving towards a 6 inches average). So, having a 7-inch tablet might not per se make a major difference for customers because it is similar in size to their phone (unless they want to use this device as a back-up device to prevent wear and tear on their phone). Additionally, since charging takes a substantial amount of time, I would rather have a tablet with longer battery life (Fire HD 8) than shorter (Fire 7). However, please note that the last argument cuts both ways as the new Fire 7 (4 hours) charges quicker as compared to the Fire HD 8 (6 hours).- UPDATE # 2 (June 15, 2019): Amazon FreeTime Unlimited- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited ($2.99/month after free subscription period)--- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over “20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids' profiles to give them more access to apps and games.” “In FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.” Another unique feature is Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish!--- Parents also have the option “to set educational goals and curfews (using FreeTime Unlimited), and manage content for up to 4 child profiles (option given during initial set-up of the tablet) with easy-to-use parental controls.”--- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers unbeatable value – I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after trial subscription ends).*FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time.UPDATE # 3 (June 21, 2019):  Battery Life and SoftwareSome customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I have experienced occasional battery fluctuations (my prior Fire seemed to have better battery life). So, I am docking a star. Some other reviewers have also experienced overheating of this device. Other than the occasional overheating that occur in all devices (when complex programs/apps are used for an extended period of time), I haven’t experienced anything major until now. Additionally, some customers have also complained about the new Fire OS causing problems. I have experienced occasional staggering of the OS and app closures but nothing major as described by other reviewers. I will continue my testing to see if other issues surface but just wanted to give a heads-up to customers so they are prepared in case they experience any issues in the future and want to contact Amazon about it.Please also note several resources were used in the compilation of this review but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review. If you have any feedback or questions or corrections, leave a note in the comments section. Thank you!\n"", '\n  I having been buying the smaller Fire tablets (7 inch) since the beginning and I can now recommend to buy this tablet. I have other sized Fire tablets (8 Inch) and a new ipad, plus the new Kindle paper white, but the Fire 7 is my go to tablet. What I use it for. Prime Video, Hulu, Netflix, Youtube.  Kindle reader for books and bible. Audible books from audible. Podcasts (stitcher). Comixology for comics (old school Marvel fan!). Instagram (I do not use facebook). Home automation with Alexa (control of my lights, ring alarm, alarms, and basic questions) works great both hands free as well as pressing the home button.  I also play light games on it, Word search, Temple run, Angry Birds series of games, Yahtzee, Subway Surfer, Crossy Roads, and a few others.  I also listen to Amazon prime music (Apple music does not work on this device).  I mainly use my Apple air buds when watching and listening and it sounds fantastic.  Picture quality is great.  This is a snappy little tablet and my favorite size.  It feels good in the hand with the solid plastic build (compared to the Fire 8 inch, which feels more ""cheap""). It is a great tablet to use while lying in bed, which is mainly when I use it (ipad 9.7 is to heavy). I feel that Amazon finally got it right with this new 2019 version. The previous versions are painfully slow to load anything, and that is why I never would recommend them especially for a child.  These new tablets are so much better, my wife wants one, and I will be buying them for my kids, something I would not even consider before, because of the frustration of the slowness (and the reason my kids took over the ipad and iphones in the first place).  As you can see this is a consumption device, meant for fun..not a computer or workhorse.  I should mention you can check email and use the tablet for video chatting and dropping in on other echo devices which works really well and my kids have fun using it, I should also mention that I am a Prime member and take advantage of the Prime photo storage, which any picture that I take on my iphone, pops up on my Fire Tablet. I should also mention why I use this for reading more than my paper white, it is because I like the ""page curl effect"" and the way it highlights my passages on books (I still use my paper white..but this is just a preference). The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the 2mp camera (which I do not use much) and the battery life, which is actually not bad, but Amazon asked for a ""star"" rating on those two features as well as tablet as a whole.  At $50 you can not go wrong. Plus if you have a previous version, just trade it in. I got $10 knocked off and an additional 20% savings. I think I paid about $33.  I will be trading in my 8 inch Fire for this size as well.  Great little tablet!\n', ""\n  This kindle worked well for a few hours and then all of a sudden it started to search the internet on it's own.  This is for my 8 year old daughter because her old kindle was not working.  This kindle really scared my child.  She would play a game and something would control the game.  We would watch it change the settings on it's own and move from ap to ap.  When the kindle was locked something kept trying to access my contacts, and unlock my kindle!!  It would change the time and change to a different alarm.  I contacted amazon and they were not helpful, because nothing worked..  I had to factory restart it twice and it kept going back to controling itself on it's own.  Finally I just had to return it because it because there was no way to use it.  Amazon needs to make a product that works.\n"", '\n  Good budget tablet but the battery drains continuously when idle at a fast rate (10% daily)\n', ""\n  I'm not a fan. It doesn't hold an internet connection well AT ALL and I hate how limited the device is. I'm sure it's mostly my fault for not reading that the fire tablets are only exclusive to Amazon apps so you can't use any apps from Google play or anything, but in the part of the description I read it said games. I didn't realize it didn't include Google play games. Unfortunately that was my reason for getting a tablet, so I will be returning mine and getting something with Google play services. If you are okay with only watching movies, TV and reading, this may be okay for you. Not sure about the internet connection though, my boyfriend's tablet (Lenovo) doesn't do that.\n""]"

I thought the 2019 Tab A was a great tablet when I got it but after using it a year, I\'d give it only 3 stars. These tablets aren\'t powerful enough except for browsing, watching movies or other media consumption, and a basic games. Last year, I chose the 32gb Galaxy Tab A which only had 2gb of RAM, and that turned out to be more frustrating than anticipated thus I wanted an upgrade. I had to frequently ""close all apps"" or suffer very noticeable lags or apps that wouldn\'t even open (apps linking into Amazon\'s Shopping for Tablet app as an example). This is definitely improved with the 3GB RAM this tablet has, although I will still ""close all apps"" about once per day.1 frustration I have with the 6th gen 9.7"" iPad (2018) and the Galaxy Tab A 10.1"" (2019) are the placement of only 1 set of ""stereo"" speakers on the bottom of the device. In landscape, this always bothered me and was 1 thing I appreciated with Amazon\'s Fire HD tablets. The addition of speakers to the top of this tablet was almost enough alone to sell me on this tablet and if that matters to you, it makes a huge difference!Since this is a tablet and with this new era of Zoom meetings, I found I actually care about front-facing cameras and I\'ve noticed that the original positioning last year on the top of the tablet in portrait made it off-centered. It\'s not been moved to the side (or top in landscape) and this takes advantage of the screen for Zoom so much better. It also makes all the bezels symmetrical, which is kind of nice.There is face authentication with this tablet! I\'m sure it\'s not nearly as robust as my iPhones (And does not work in low light), but the addition of this is fantastic! Last year I was using Trusted Lock based on GPS location at my home combined with a PIN number, which was not a huge problem, but I love this addition.Finally, the screen is rounded at the corners which I think gives it a nice little touch. It\'s not an OLED screen, but at this price I don\'t have any complaints. It\'s about the same as last years.THE CONSThe ambient light sensor is next to the camera on the side, which if you use your tablets in portrait, is often where your hand is. This darkens the screen dramatically and so I have to turn this off since unless I\'m watching a video, I\'m always using this in portrait.The default white balance is really cold, so I use the blue light filter a lot... Also, there is some light bleed on the edges of the screen. It doesn\'t bother me at this price point but was these are the main reasons I\'d give this 4 instead of 5 stars.This one is like 5 mm wider than last year\'s version.--not a big deal to me. Otherwise, the only other real con is it\'s not super powerful.There is still some lag with this tablet, although again improved from last year. Overall, I think it\'s fair in the price point but this is not a performance tablet.COMPARISON TO FIRE HD10 AND BASIC IPADI prefer this to the Fire HD10 though because it has Google Play Store on its own. I really like stock Android (and held onto the Nexus 7 2013 way too long because of that), but Samsung\'s One UI is pretty decent and not obtrusive enough that I miss stock Android much. The only customizations I did was replace keyboard with Google\'s and uninstalled several default Samsung apps; I didn\'t install Google Launcher or Nova. When I had a Fire HD10, which was not the most recent version, I also had trouble getting all of Google\'s basic apps to work.. not sure if that\' s till an issue. I prefer the UI on these to Amazon Fire\'s, and overall it\'s worth the extra $50-$80 to me compared to the Fire HD10.Compared to our iPad that mostly my wife uses, I do like the narrower form factor of this one. It\'s just a bit more comfortable to hold. Last year I almost bought the 7th gen iPad, but since the processor was same as our 6th gen, I went with this one thinking this year I might upgrade. This year\'s iPad does have a new processor and I was planning to get that until I saw this came out, but for the price (in between the 8th gen iPad and the Fire HD10), 4 speaker array, and biometric authentication, this tablet meets my needs and included key features I missed--so, thanks Samsung!EDIT: followup 4 months later- docked a star from 4 stars to 3 stars as it does suffer some performance lag with multiple apps open. I ""close all apps"" about once per day (although compared to last year\'s tablet, I was doing it every 15 minutes""- I\'ve found the portrait/landscape sensing to be super sensitive, to the point it sometimes gets annoying\n', ""\n  1 star is reserved for future update.Tab A7 review:I primarily use this tablet for reading and media consumption so thats what my experience will be from.Overall this is a great tablet in regards to its performance for reading and watching YouTube and movies. The screen size and display is great for watching videos, there is nothing fancy about it like the latest tab S series tablets but its gets the job done. In regards to reading the 1080p display and size of the screen is a joy to read off of. Coming from a 720p fire tablet 8, the letters look crisp and the screen real-estate is a major upgrade.The tablet is relatively light however it might be difficult to hold with one hand due to its size. The quad speakers on this tablet are loud and crisp so thats something I'm happy about since I feel more immersed in whatever I'm watching.The 3 gb of ram will get the job done if you don't have too many apps open (8 or more in my experience), even if you have a lot of apps running in the background the only noticeable difference would be a minor slow down when changing apps or opening a new app.The only real con which isn't a big deal is the storage on the tablet itself (32/64 gigs). If you're like me and have a ton of audio books, epubs, pdfs, and videos downloaded, I highly suggest spending a few extra bucks on a large capacity micro SD card. If you just stream videos, you should be fine on the amount of local memory.Overall I'd highly recommend this tablet, ESPECIALLY at the price of $180. If you are looking for something to simply watch YouTube or Netflix and maybe play some candy crush this is the tablet for you. If you are looking for an awesome budget upgrade from a fire tablet 7 or 8, I can't highly recommend this enough, this tablet is silky smooth and snappier compared to the fire 7/8. If you are a student that is looking for something more productive (note taking, excel, PowerPoint, writing on pdfs) i would not recommend this due to its lack of RAM and integrated stylus support, you're better off with the tab s6 lite/tab 6/ tab s5e‐------‐-----------‐---------------Compartive review:I had recently bought a Samsung tab A 10.1 3 gb variant (2019) and I've had it for about 3 weeks. I just recently found about this tablet and was curious about the differences so I went ahead and bought it due to its low price ($180) compared to the $200 i payed for the tab A.Biggest difference i noticed immediately was the speakers. WAY clearer sound and louder, due to the quad speaker set up. It leaves the muffled dual speakers in the tab A in the dust. I'd say the A7 has great sound quality for the price point.Compared to the Tab A, the A7 has a similar screen and a bit higher resolution, but the difference isn't significant. One thing I noticed was that the tab A had a bit of a red tint compared to the A7, I couldn't really tell unless I had the screens right next to each other.The A7 battery capacity is also a big bigger compared to the tab A, its slightly noticeable.\n"", ""\n  The product is advertised as having Samsung the Exynos 9611 chipset, but it actually has a slower Qualcomm chipset. Prior to my purchase, Amazon said in a call that it had a Samsung chipset. Buyer beware, and I have called to Amazon asking them to correct the product information on the page.Of course, many may not care about the chipset running the device. I'm now testing the tablet to see if it meets my need. It's not as good as the Samsung S5e and has no S-Pen like Samsung S6 Lite, and has a sharp screen, and it seems like a good tablet for content consumption. But the chipset matters to me, so I'll be returning it.\n"", ""\n  This is a good tablet for videos and movies. If you plan on reading lots of books and documents I’d go with a different model, unless you're ok with a very tall narrower screen when you hold this tablet in portrait position.Pros:- Very comfortable to hold in landscape mode- Great Battery Life- Very good speakers- Good build quality- Headphone jackCons:- No fingerprint reader- The screen is pretty reflective but this is common in cheaper tablets- Rear Camera is  mediocre- A way to calibrate the display in the settings would have been nice\n"", '\n  Llevo ya 15 días de uso, y me encanta, yo buscaba un producto para consumo multimedia con capacidad de almacenamiento grande.

El sonido de esta tablet es en mi opinión, una de las cosas que más resalta.Para uso doméstico, escolar y para alguien que tenga una micro empresa es muy funcional.

También descargué un emulador de N64 y he podido jugar súper bien (ya sé que no son las gráficas más exigentes, pero es perfecta justo para esto). Llegó un día antes de lo esperado en perfecto estado, y compré además una funda con teclado marca Finite (o algo así) que quedó súper bien. Como dicen, el sonido es espectacular y lo de que no tenga lector de huellas para mi es lo de menos, está muy payaso quejarse de eso...

So nice to have a simple setup as it is all the person I gave it to really needed anyway. Came with 100% charged battery and was easy and quick to get running. Nice screen and decent battery life. Everything is saved in the cloud and only plan on using it on WiFi at home, however it does have a memory expansion and sim card slots.

I was able to load Norton, VLC Player, Firefox, Kindle App, System Mechanic and still have 28 GB free in my memory. The 4GB of RAM allows me to keep a few windows open at the same time. I am really loving the 3.0 std USB port and mini sd card with up to 128GB extra storage which allows me to download lots of movies and shows to watch later, or I can watch shows from a usb stick drive through the USB port. So far, the only con about this device is that the battery doesn\'t last very long, so I need to keep it plugged in and the speaker is weak... (need to use earphones to get clear sound). I bought this in case my laptop goes out so I can stay connected and also, to play videos off of a usb flash drive or micro sd card ( I used Kingston Canvas Select 128GB microSDHC Class 10 microSD Memory Card UHS-I 80MB/s R Flash Memory Card with Adapter (SDCS/128GB). Downloads are fast and the graphics are good.  I just received it today, so I haven\'t had much time to play with it. So far, I am pleased with my purchase and the price is great!  It would be nice to have an attachable keyboard for this tablet. I couldn\'t find one for this specific tablet. Hopefully, Fusion5 will have one available soon. I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the limited battery life and sound quality. UPDATE 10/16/18 :  My tablet stopped charging and when I clicked on the ""Battery"" icon on the Task Bar, it said ""Plugged in, discharging"" next to the % of battery left. This was NOT an issue with the tablet...It is a software issue with Windows 10, so if any of you have this problem DON\'T return the tablet !  This is the fix for that :STEPS : To Fix ""Plugged In, discharging"" - Windows 8/10 (Non Removable Battery)1 - Go to ""Device Manager"" (Rt Click Windows Logo on left bottom corner of screen - To Rt Click use Point & Hold method in ""Gestures"" section of the User Manual which came with this tablet - point and hold until box appears under your finger or pointer, then release and a menu should pop up like when you Rt Click on your computer.) Select ""Device Manager"" in the pop-up menu.2 - Open ""Batteries""3 - Rt Click ""Microsoft AC Adapter"" then click ""Uninstall""4 - Rt Click ""Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery"" then click ""Uninstall""5 - At top of Device Manager page click on ""Action"" then click on ""Scan for Hardware Changes""6 - Go back to the list below and open ""Batteries"" again7 -  Rt Click ""Microsoft AC Adapter""..... then click ""Update Driver Software"" ..... then click on  ""Browse My Computer for Driver Software"" .... then click on ""Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my  computer"" .... then click on ""Microsoft AC Adapter"" (make sure the box for Show Compatible Hardware is checked)8 - Rt Click ""Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery""..... then click ""Update Driver Software"" ..... then click on  ""Browse My Computer for Driver Software"" .... then click on ""Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my  computer"" .... then click on ""Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery"" (make sure the box for Show  Compatible Hardware is checked) .... then close Device Manager9 - Click on Battery Icon on Task Bar to check charging status. The computer should now read that it is charging and it will no longer say  ""Plugged in, discharging""I hope this helps. PS: I still really like this tablet and will update if there are any problems. UPDATE 10/17/18 : Yesterday, before I figured out this was a software issue, I emailed Customer Service about the charging issue. I told them that I didn\'t know if this was a hardware or a software issue. Today, when I checked my email, I had received a prompt reply. This was the reply :From: F5CS LTD <ch14230-mohodkah@xsell.co>Sent: Wednesday, October 17, 2018 4:32 AMSubject: Re: Charger not workingHi,Thank you for your email update.Apologies for any inconvenience.However, without any further delay we are sending you a replacement charger to rule out the issue.Please update us how you get along upon receipt of the new charger.We appreciate your patience and cooperation.Regards,MikeFusion5Fusion5 Customer Service is prompt and very accommodating. This company makes me feel supported in my choice to purchase this tablet.\n', '\n  Fusion 5 10.1"" Windows 10 TabletI picked up this tablet as an upgrade to my Kindle Fire 8"". Overall, I\'d say it was a good choice.Initially, I began shopping for a 10"" version of my same tablet, but I thought, why not upgrade a bit in the process?  Since most of my other equipment is in the Microsoft ecosystem, I chose to go with a Windows tablet. That way, I can sync easily between my desktop, phone, and tablet, having all my data available from any device.When I first started shopping, my gut instinct was to pick up the MS Surface Go, which is a 10"" Windows 10 tablet. The down side is that Windows is running in S Mode. Windows 10 in S Mode is a more limited, locked-down Windows operating system. In S Mode, you can only install apps from the Store, and you can only browse the web with Microsoft Edge.I didn\'t want to be limited, and I began looking around for another solution, eventually deciding on the Fusion5.Order the device through Amazon was simple and painless, as most Amazon transactions are.  The device was shipped promptly, and arrived when it was supposed to.I\'ve been using the tablet for a few weeks now, so I think I might be able to relay my experience with it.ScreenThe screen is great, on par with other high end tablets.  The resolution of the 10.1"" (diagonally measured) display makes for a nice crisp display, with good color and brightness.Touch sensitive is good as well. I\'ve had no problem with making selections for text fields, buttons, etc.  Some other folks have commented about a problem with selecting a text field, and not having the on-screen keyboard pop up.  I don\'t think this is a failing of the tablet itself, but rather the way Windows 10 works with touch. It\'s been an issue for the last several version of Windows, and 10 is no different. Putting Windows 10 into  tablet mode alleviates the problem somewhat, but in some text fields you may need to double tap.Using the Inking function in Edge, OneNote, and other apps worked flawlessly. Using a stylus or your finger, you can highlight data on web pages or other places, or even include short notes.The only complaint I would have about the display is the inclusion of a less than stellar screen protector with the device, already installed. When  I received mine, it was loose along the bottom bezel of the display. Further, the protector slightly hindered use of touch features. Once I removed the protector, touch sensitivity was much better. The downside if your remove the protector (and don\'t replace it) is the potential for scratches, as well as the mass of fingerprints that will collect on the display.ConnectivityThe only option for connectivity include with the device is WiFi.  I\'ve tested it by connecting to several different access points, public and private, and have had no issues.  The only downside I can mention is the lack of high speed options with the on-board WiFi. In my testing, I was only able to connect with 802.11b, which is limited to 11 Mbps, so you\'re roughly getting 9.5-10 Mbps. I think a better option would be to use an 802.11 b/g/n chip for faster speeds.Even with the limited connectivity, I am able stream NetFlix, work on documents from OneDrive, and surf the internet with no issues.  There is some slight buffering at the start of a NetFlix video, but my desktop does the exact same thing, so I don\'t see that as negative.  The rest of the stream is fine, and displays in HD.  Streaming from YouTube was a bit better, with a quicker start to viewing than with NetFlix.The device comes with a variety of ports on the side, including a full size USB port, mini HDMI, USB-C and a power port.  Charging via the power port *or* USB-C worked fine. I wasn\'t able to test USB-C peripherals, as I don\'t have any.Using the standard USB port, I connected a wired mouse, and it worked with no issue.  also tried a USB keyboard, headset, and game controller. All worked with problem. As long as Windows has or can find the correct driver for the device, most should work with the tablet.One cool thing I was able to do is connect the tablet to my KVM switch. A KVM switch (with KVM being an abbreviation for ""keyboard, video and mouse"") is a hardware device that allows a user to control multiple computers from one keyboard, monitor, and mouse.Using the KVM, I was able to use my full size equipment at my desk. The device found the peripherals with no issues, and I happily surfed the web and am actually writing this review using the tablet now, using the big screen.  Document editing is much easier with full size equipment, and the Fusion5 had no problems allowing me to use my regular gear.Bluetooth connectivity is good, and I tried a couple of different devices with the Fusion5, including my phone, a mouse, and two different sets of headphones.  Range and functionality was good. Leaving the tablet in my home office, I was able to move up to 50 feet away, and the sound was still good in my headphones.SoundThe tablet included two speakers, although they are not very good. At maximum volume, the sound is *just* audible.  This doesn\'t bother me, however, as I use a bluetooth headset when I am streaming video, using Skype, etc.I haven\'t use the on-board microphone, but I imagine you would be better served getting a good bluetooth headset for Skype calls, or perhaps a wired headset connected to the USB port.StorageThe version of the device I purchased included 4 GB of RAM, as well as 64 GB of storage on-board.While 4 GB of RAM won\'t give you enough ""oomph"" to run things like MySQL or Doom, it is more than enough to edit documents in Word, spreadsheets in Excel, surf the net with multiple tabs open (but no too many!), and play some lighter games like Asphalt Airborne and the like.Mass storage of the device is a seemingly huge 64 GB. However, keep in mind that Windows 10 takes a large chunk of this space for itself. The device does include an SD card slot, with which you can use to expand the storage. With this in mind, I did purchase a 128 GB SD card. I inserted the card, and it worked straight away.The first thing I did is set my OneDrive folder to the new drive, to keep things of the system drive. That way, you\'re not cluttering up the system drive with your random cat pictures and crossword puzzles.Operating SystemThe Fusion5 comes with Windows 10 Home Edition, 32-bit. This is not a watered down version of Windows, nor is it Windows running in S mode. This is the full version of Windows 10 Home Edition.  What this means is that anything that you can run on your home machine, you can run on your tablet, provided that it fits in to the requirements of the software.For example, I am a hobbyist software developer.  I write applications and utilities for use by people all over the world. On this device, I was able to install and use a Win32 application that I built on my desktop machine. No errors, no missing drivers. It just worked.Where all this leads is if there is something you want to connect to this tablet, or some software you want to install, the only questions you need to ask are ""Is it compatible with Windows 10?"" and ""Does my hardware meet the requirements?""Battery LifeThe claimed battery life is around eight hours, and I have no dispute with that.  I charge the device once per week, and have yet to have an unexpected shutdown due to battery problems.  I imagine with some power management like dimming the display and throttling the CPU a bit (both available by tapping on the battery icon in the system tray), you could stretch it out to ten hours.SummaryI\'m pretty happy with this purchase.  I use the Fusion5 for reading ebooks, watching streaming video, and some light web surfing. While it won\'t replace my desktop or my full laptop (it\'s a beast!), it is great for use on airplanes, laying in bed at night, riding the bus, etc.Besides the few minor items I pointed out previously, I would make one more ask for this device. The tablet includes no recovery media with it. It would be nice to have the option of performing a clean install of Windows 10 from media, if the need arises.  As it sits, I\'m not sure it can be booted from USB, but than may be an option, provided I can find the product key.Overall, if you are in the market for an inexpensive Windows 10 device, I would recommend the Fusion5 10.1"" Windows 10 tablet. At just under $200, it\'s a pretty great buy.\n', '\n  I bought this tablet to replace my 5 year old Asus VivoTab, which I use whilst travelling. The old machine could not support the latest version of Windows 10 and was noticeable slow attempting to support Office 365 desktop applications. This brilliant bit of kit, is not only 64bit but also includes the very latest build of Windows (1803), so includes ""Files-on-Demand"", which gives me access to over 1Tb of files via my Office 365 account. All the applications run smoothly and super fast. The tablet\'s build looks very professional, with a nice texture on the back, which helps you grip the device.If like me, you use the Microsoft Teams app, you will need a keyboard, as the on-screen keyboard hides the chat entry field. Having checked with the seller, I now have the matching Fusion5 case with keyboard, which I am pleased to say has a UK layout and build-in tracker pad. A slight down side, is the lack of instructions, although as an IT professional of over 40 years, I have quick become accustom to the enhanced functionally of the tracker pad.The tablet does get quite warm whilst charging and when performing CPU intensive processes, but still OK to handle. This may have a negative impact on the battery life, which is currently exceptional... over 10 hours of average use between charges. Only time will tell, if the battery can\'t deal with the heat.If you need a small portable Windows laptop or tablet, then you sure certainly consider this device, as its performance vs cost is outstanding.\n', '\n  I bought this to replace an aging Samsung NC10 Netbook, for use both in tablet mode and with a keyboard.  In fact the screen on the Fusion5 10” is the same size, but it’s much slimmer and lighter.  I was keen to find a device with a minimum 4GB / 64GB to run Windows 10 effectively, and I added a 128GB Sandisk Ultra microSDXC card to get maximum storage – moving the standard documents, music, pictures and video folders onto it to leave maximum space on the main C:\\ drive.Other reviews have commented on the excellent specifications, so I’ll just comment on my own usage in desktop and tablet mode.For desktop use the compatible docking case with keyboard has a magnetic coupling and a clever supporting stand, and adding a Bluetooth mouse is useful for any serious work.  The magnetic coupling isn’t strong enough for the tablet-keyboard combination to be carried around open or used when sitting on a sofa, but this is when tablet mode is most appropriate.The tablet is nicely finished but really needs some protection when used without the keyboard case, so after careful consideration of dimensions I bought a Leather Case for Sony Xperia Z 10.1"" Tablet which fits almost perfectly (just slightly over-sized in width) and has a hand strap and viewing stand (see photo) - https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00E9WRNBO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 – the power and up-down buttons are obscured, but still usable when pressed through the fabric.  I already had a separate Bluetooth keyboard, and find it handy to use this instead of the keyboard case, though the latter is more responsive when typing quickly.The tablet suddenly went dead after a couple of weeks but Fusion5 quickly supplied a replacement, so it’s reassuring that their UK-based customer service is very responsive.  The replacement came with a completely up-to-date Windows 10 installation.Overall I’m very pleased with my purchase, especially at the price, and like the flexibility of having the additional XperiaZ case and separate keyboard as well as the compatible Fusion5 keyboard case.\n', ""\n  Well I wasn't expecting quite so much from this little device but I am pleasantly surprised. It's a Windows 10 PC and unlike other tablets has SD, HDMI, full size USB, mini USB (with an adapter to full size) as well as Bluetooth and WiFi. The supplied power adapter is small enough to carry with you and the pad will charge from USB but much slower. Although I haven't timed the battery life it seems more than enough for general use. Being Windows there's a lot of software out there and running Libre office is easy.Build quality is better than expected as is the screen and its responsiveness is as good as any. A bonus - it comes with a screen protector pre installed!The Atom processor and graphics are fine (don't expect to run Titanfall, but this is cheaper than most graphics cards cost!) and HD videos don't make it break a sweat! I am more pleased with my purchase than I would have imagined.So far so good. Have seen some reviews for the 2/32 version saying they can't upgrade Windows - run disk clean to clear the old Windows upgrade cache as it clears a lot of junk.\n"", '\n  My 15-year old Dell PC tower finally gave up the ghost a few days ago and, with it running XP, was long overdue for replacement. I have an iPad, but it doesn\'t have a USB port, which I need to transfer to and from my phone and playback from memory sticks in the car and home stereos. I found Tablets with full-size USB ports pretty rare until I stumbled across the Fusion5 windows 10 10"" tablet on Amazon. The low price point of £154 at first suggested that it couldn\'t be up to much, but I was pleasantly surprised when itarrived just 2 days later. It seems to be of quality construction, with 12 months guarantee (plus additional 90 days if registered within 14 days) and the screen is clearer than the \'retina\' display on my iPad ! Very pleased with my purchase and upgrade to the latest Windows 10 OS, so much so that I will be using it for more than just transfers to memory sticks - to this end, I have already downloaded Libre Office (the free alternative to Microsoft) and Money Sunset Deluxe financial apps. A separate keyboard would be of great benefit, though and is next on my list - the compact screen is a boon but also hinders typing. Overall very pleased - and the online chat support from Fusion5 is also very good !\n', ""\n  For its price, this isn't a bad tablet, however, there are a number of big flaws in its design.Firstly, the sound is dreadful, even with it on full, you can just about watch Netflix lying next to it in bed in a quiet room (my budget Asus tablet outperforms this by a long way, as will any decent smartphone).Second issue is the finish, I might have got a bad one but there were a number of small bubbles under the screen (outside of the display area luckily) and with a plastic finish, it doesn't feel strong.It also has dreadful WiFi, sitting next to the router, I can pick up around 30mb/s, whereas my Pixel 2 connected to the same WiFi network gets more than double this speed.Final bugbear is the Port layout, full size USB is brilliant but it's at the top of the tablet, meaning that, using it in laptop configuration, you have a load of cables hanging out of the top of it, the ports are also really close together meaning that I actually hand to file down the HDMI to mini-HDMI adapter to actually get it to fit alongside a USB cable if using both at the same time.These points aside, for Netflix, Word, Excel, Chrome, PowerPoint and general tasks generally better suited to Windows over IoS on Android, this is a bargain price and I can see me using it a lot despite some disappointing issues.\n""]"
