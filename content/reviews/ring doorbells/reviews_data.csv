I have been using that knock-off since then and I hate it. The image quality wasn’t awful, but it had a lot of bugs and it didn’t play well with “Alexa”. I kept automating my home adding echo’s, lights, switches, cameras, you name it and every time I circled back to the doorbell I would think: “I already have a video doorbell and the Ring doorbell is still pricey; maybe I should buy some other automation toys”. Well, this new Ring came out, and it was less than 100$ thus I said, let’s try it…Appearance:Dimensions wise, this one is pretty small (5.1”x2.4”x 1.1”). The button is very noticeably a button; to me this is important as with my old knock off doorbell, people would constantly push the camera lenses thinking that they rang the doorbell.Differences between this Ring Doorbell and Previous versions:I did some internet research prior to deciding for it, and I could only find a few things: (1) it supports only 2.4 GHz networks instead of being dual band, (2) it only works as a fully wired setup (3) it has a single faceplate and (4)it is way cheaper than previous models.To me, it wasn’t a big deal the doorbell not being dual band, I planned on using the 2.4 GHz band anyway as I have been with my knockoff brand doorbell. There are several obstructions along the way (two thick walls and some furniture between the door and my repeater, and my router is in the basement), and the 2.4 GHz network is usually better for that albeit a bit slower.This doorbell requires to have an existing wired doorbell setup, unlike previous iterations that you could have fully battery powered doorbell. Yet the setup is only needed for power. You will be bypassing the existing doorbell chime, thus, you will either need to purchase the model that include the Ring Chime (+20$), purchase a separate Ring Chime (30-50$) or use a compatible Alexa device as the speaker(s). I am using a few of my echoes and I like the setup a whole bunch.The Ring Video Doorbell has a single face plate (black) vs 4 different color ones for the Pro. I did search online for other faceplates and I found a pearl white one going for about 15$ but I am sticking with the black one.The newer model is about 70% cheaper. About 60$ vs the 200$ MSRP for the Pro.Issues so far:I haven’t had a lot of issues, but I already had one. I had some connectivity issues right of the bat. The fact that this doorbell bypasses the hardwired chime exacerbates this. No connectivity means no doorbell whether you have power or not. A few resets, I moved my repeater closer and it appear the problem was corrected. However, I point it out because when compared to my old 2.4 GHz knock-off video doorbell, I never had an issue. I am considering this as a one off but I will update my review if this issue persists.Bottom lineWhat I liked:Compatibility with Alexa. When Amazon acquired Ring a while back, I just knew that integration with Echo devices would probably only improve but even knowing that, I was impressed. You can define specific devices you want them to work with. It allows for tons of customization including ringtones.I currently have two echo dots and an echo spot serving as my alerts and this setup works great. The video playback on the Echo Spot is smooth as silk with minimal Lag. I will be linking it up to my new Echo Show when it gets here, next week. I don’t envision any issues linking it up, but I will update my review if needed.It features an advanced motion detection system that allows for customizable alert motion zones. It is extremely intuitive to setup. Thumbs up, all the way.It was very easy to installIt looks elegant yet sleek.It is cheaper than any previous Ring Model.What I dislike so far.It supports only 2.4 GHz networks. This is not a major negative as 2.4 GHz networks usually allow for a better range, especially if there are obstructions along the way. Still, it is worth mentioning.I have a hardwired doorbell chime that is useless now. If my WIFI fails at any point, my doorbell is dead in the water.I already had connectivity issues. They might have been a one off so I am not necessarily overreacting to them but I will update my review if needed.The first two negatives were design choices that allowed lowering the price point and they were something I knew coming in. However, they are still significant enough that I called them out.Overall, for the price, this is actually a very good device. If you already have a Ring doorbell, this item is not for you. If you don’t, and you are ok with a fully WIFI driven, hard wired power doorbell camera, I strongly recommend it.\n', '\n  Don’t waist your time or money.  This bypassed my old doorbell and was not clear that the old doorbell would no longer work.Why did they do this?!?  I bought this to replace the button outside my house and the camera was a nice feature but my tplink $30 camera was just fine and half the price.  The worst part for me is I just don’t understand why they would do this. The more I think about it the more it bugs me. This is going back for sure.\n', ""\n  I have had the original Ring doorbell for a few years. I never used the chime in our house (actually hate the one builders put in, so that was a reason we got a ring doorbell in the first place). We use Echo Dots and phones so not ringing the chime was OK for us. Also don't mind using 2.4 ghz for this device. When I saw the Wired was coming out and the price, I had to give it a try, especially given the credit given for trading in the old one. I took a picture of old vs new so you can see the size difference. I like that it is stripped down to bare minimum, but still has better features than our previous Ring like Pre-Roll, 1080p, etc. I would say it is comparable to Pro at 1/4 the price. The small size is great as I can mount it right on the doorframe now.\n"", '\n  Installed this on my lunch break with zero problems. Anyone who rated this less than 5 stars did not do their due diligence. Any research comparing the doorbells would tell you that you are unable to use your existing chime. We have quite a few devices on the 2.4GHz frequency and have no problems.Works great with existing echo dot devices and had no difficulty setting this up. Actually it was absolutely painless. I do not need my 30 year old chime to freak the dogs out and tell me someone is at the door, my phone and my echo dots take care of that!To anyone new to ring, yes, you have to pay a measely $30 per year to record your video. Worth it. I have two ring cameras, $60.. still worth it. The most you will spend is $100 per year for all your devices. Can I set up my own camera system and record locally? Sure. Do I want to spend hundreds of dollars on a server to do so? Absolutely not. Do I want to deal with drives randomly breaking? Nope. Check the cost of WD purple (surveillance drives), the cost of a server and a software license. By the time you get your money back by comparison to ring cameras, there will be better tech out.TLDR, this is a smart doorbell designed for smart devices. This will not work with your old equipment. This is absolutely worth every penny and the annual fee.\n', '\n  I installed the new Rind doorbell wired exactly as the instruction said. It updated, and we were able to see outside. Within 10 minutes it no longer worked. Spent 45 minutes with tech support with them verifying that we did everything correctly. So they are sending a replacement, but when I installed the old doorbell it no longer works and there is no power to the chime. The circuit was not trip so the Ring doorbell burnt out the doorbell transformer. Not I need to spend more money, maybe hire an electrician to get this fixed. Very Upset!\n', '\n  This new ring doorbell is awesome! I had the old one and it was good too but I feel like this one the camera is more clear, and it works super fast!\n', '\n  It was fairly easy to install.  Integrates well with my Ring Alarm Gen2 in that it runs under the same mobile app.  I like that with my Echo Show, I can ask Alexa to show me the Front Door to get a live view (and when someone rings the doorbell, it shows the live view automatically).I\'ve enabled the ""people only mode"" which supposedly will only give you alerts if people trigger motion, but will have to see how accurate that is.Overall happy thus far.\n', '\n  Super easy to install over traditional doorbell wiring\n']"

The materials provided upon unboxing were sufficient enough to guide me to setting up and installing this security system without any prior experience.  I am converting over from ADT due to their expensive monthly costs and I was extremely happy to find that the magnet side of the window and doors sensors (the smaller side of the sensor) worked with Ring. What this meant was I only had to replace part of my ADT system, thus making install easier and less time consuming.Software is easy to use.  I was able to figure it out on my own without any instructions.Some people will complain that Ring doesn't have glass break sensors but coming over from ADT I will tell you that this is a blessing. The biggest false alarm you will get is from glass break sensors, especially if you have kids. I can't tell you how many times I had a false alarm go off because a kid banged their toys around, or screamed at the right tone, or threw a dish into the sink.  I understand the need for glass break sensors in certain situations, like a bigger where you might not be able to hear a window break. If you want a glass break sensor there is nothing stopping you from putting a window/door sensor on the glass itself, positioned in a manner that doesn't interfere with the operation of the window.  Stick the sensor on the bottom of the window frame and the contact magnet above it directly on the glass. If/when someone smashes the window and clears out the glass to climb thru, it's going to go off.  I get that this is not practical for every scenario and every window,  but it is an option.Alexa Guard is another option and while it isn't a true glass break sensor, it is a bit of a backup.I want to edit to add that I'm a little frustrated with Amazon on the package options and shipping.I bought the 14 piece kit, however, I did not need the 14 piece kit.  I didn't need the 2nd keypad, motion sensor or range extender.  All I needed was one the base station, one keypad, one motion sensor, the fire alarm listener and 8 contact sensors.  Buying all that stuff separately cost more than the 14 piece kit so I was forced to order it.  This is when I became aware that a true 14 piece kit doesn't exist.  What Amazon did was ship me an 8 piece kit and then all the other pieces separate, like I wanted to order anyway.  They all shipped at different times with the last pieces arriving 5 days after the initial kit.  I wish they would have at least arrived at the same time so I could have installed my system all at once, however, doing it this way gave me the chance to see just how easy it is to add on additional devices at any time.The cellular backup is via AT&T.  You'll want to check service at your address.\n"", '\n  I\'ll share the one mistake I made during setup so that you can avoid it. If you designate a door as being a secondary entrance, when the security system is turned on, if the door is opened, the alarm immediately goes off. Whereas if a door is designated as a main door, the alarm won\'t go off until the delay period (which is configurable) has elapsed.Setup takes about 1-2 hours including mounting the keypad and base, the latter of which doesn\'t come with any mounting hardware. Follow the instructions, setting up one device at a time. The base\'s power supply must be plugged in at all times, and the range extender plugs directly into an outlet (no cord). The keypad has a rechargable battery and has to be charged every few months. The sensors all contain batteries that are supposed to last 2-3 years.Integration with Alexa on my echo devices works well with arming (turning on) the system, but is unreliable with disarming when you return home so mount the keypad somewhere convenient to your usual entry way doors. Alexa mobile app works fine.Would be nice if there was an ""arm immediately"" mode so that when you arm the system after letting out the dog at 03:00 AM, everyone in the house doesn\'t have to listen to the system go through the delay count down prior to arming again.Another tip - if necessary, you can turn the sensor pieces so that they are 90 degrees to each other instead of mounting flush to each other in the same plane.Lots of settings to play with... Different sounds for each door, volumes, light settings, delay periods, etc.\n', ""\n  I purchased this after having xfinity Home for 6 years.  I got tired of them raising my rates and playing with contracts.  I love the new Ring system.  I also purchased a peephole cam and interior camera.  The system is VERY easy to install.  I can't believe Comcast forces a $99 install fee for their similar system to install.  Everything worked as it should out of the box.  The door sensors are a little larger than most but they have some give on spacing and didn't have any problems.  The system itself let's you setup multiple users.  I have it notify me on my phone each time my door opens and closes but this can be enabled/disabled.  There are no rules options as far as I can see like I had with my last provider (i.e. Automatic arm the system at X time in case I forgot).  Very excited about the $10/month price tag.\n"", '\n  Love the concept for this product, it was very easy to install and use.  Batteries and double sided tape made the install take an hour for the whole thing vs. days for traditional wired products.  Tying into Ring camera system is nice too.  Also, being able to have it professionally monitored is a must and glad to see it exists.  Only problem was the motion detector didn\'t capture motion in the first 3-4 feet on a high ceiling (10\') mount.  Perhaps it needs to be mounted lower.  To solve the problem I just put another motion sensor on the opposite corner.  If not for this problem I would have given 5 stars.Installation tips:1)  Be sure to clean the surface before attaching double sided tape.  Rubbing alcohol and a cloth work best.  Otherwise it won\'t stick as well.  Do not use chemicals like windex that can leave residue or hard the adhesive.2)  Check door opening and closing before attaching contact sensors.  If you have an ""arm"" on the door at the top it is possible it will hit the sensor if you put it in the wrong place.3)  Follow the instructions on the app.  They are simple and quick and save headaches.4)  Remove the battery protector tape one device install at a time.  Just seems to make this simple and easy for identifying the right device vs. numbers/bar codes etc.\n', '\n  Easy to setup as I went from Simplisafe. I went from $25 a month to $10 which is a huge savings.Easy to install, looks fresh, and excited to complete the set(Floodlights next).\n']"

The field of view, responsiveness, sound quality and quality of the picture are much, much better on the Ring Doorbell 3 than the first generation unit.  It also limits the motion response to just the area I selected unlike the old unit that over responded and picked up the movement of cars and trucks more than 30 feet away even though I had adjusted it to be less responsive.  I'm very satisfied with the new unit.\n"", '\n  Don’t listen to the negative reviews. It was easy to connect to my SmartThings and setting up wifi is similar to google. When you connect to the network you have to disconnect your existing network and connect to the device with your phone or tablet. I was able to connect it through my existing hardwire doorbell and my existing doorbell ring worked as well. You just have to go through the ring app and turn that feature on. The video is clean, vivid and not choppy. I connected to my 5ghz network and the signal works just fine. I tested it multiple times with no issues. When someone rings the device my doorbell rings and my Amazon Alexa announces someone is at the front door. A banner popups up and on it and live view activates. The ring service is $30 a year. I also tried it through my fire tv and when asked show me the front door my TV screen went straight to live view. No app needed. Just remember to add the ring skill on your Alexa software and do a search for the device to add it. Once that’s done your set.

Been messing with settings for 4 days and can’t stop it from notifying me every time a car goes by and missing half the people that walk up on my porch.

Well the router is 6 feet away, with only the wall that the ring is installed on between the 2.

Changing to 5-star rating for two reasons, the outstanding customer service, and receiving a replacement that is working 100% the way it should. There were many emails back and forth to try and get my ring 3 working. After trying all possible remedies customer service sent me a new ring 3. I installed it 2 days ago and it is up and running without any of the problems I had in the past. So if you do have a problem rest easy knowing the Ring backs up their product and will make it right.Here's the pros/cons for me. Great picture quality and night vision are the pros, motion detection is really the only con I have. Even though I have set up the detection for the 5-15 feet range and have blocked 3 of the 4 areas you are allowed to it is still picking up traffic going by on the street which is about 40 feet from the door. Short of putting up a wall on my sidewalk (which I am sure the neighbors would love) I do not see any way of fixing this. I notice that many other reviewers have the same problems with setting distance and motion detection. Not sure if Ring will/can do a software fix for this but they should. So I guess that annoying detection is better than none at all.\n""]"

Whutter you doin’ on my porch! Put that package down, the police are on their way!”But it doesn’t work that way out here in Suburbia, not in the real world.Oh, I tried, I really tried. I poured through the meek User Guide that came with the kit, graduated to the FAQs on the Ring website, and made so many calls to Ring Tech Support that I cringed each time in expectation that Ring would announce “You’re exceeded your limit!” But of course, they didn’t. They patiently answered my questions, helped me understand about 30-second versus 60-second video clips and the lag or buffering issue and zones and sensitivity. I learned about Device Health and Speed Test and download and upload speeds.I moved my mailbox out of the way of the video doorbell. I bought a new porchlight that didn’t cast its ubiquitous glow onto the doorbell. I climbed into a 110-degre attic, swam through an ocean of blown-in insulation to find and replace a doorbell transformer. Because who among us has the tools or the skills to measure the output voltage of your doorbell wires? BTW, your local hardware store does not stock a doorbell transformer that matches the exact specs of the Ring Video Doorbell Pro, I had to order one online.From a patient cable internet technician, I learned about updating the firmware on my wireless router (“You gotta do this 1, 2 times a year!”). But it was worth it, because now my download and upload speeds are in what Ring calls “the Good Range”. I also purchased and installed the Ring Chime Pro, even though my house is what I would call Small by today’s standards – under1,000 sq. ft.But none of that helped. Even though when I go to Live View and can see all of my yard in vivid color (or stark black-and-white at night) and see every twig movement and hear far-away roosters crow, it still won’t detect and alert me to a person walking up my driveway, until they are actually standing on my porch directly in front of the camera. Oh, it will do it once in a while, maybe twice in a while, but it won’t do it every time, it won’t do it even a majority of the time. The only time it does it 100% is when the person is actually standing on my porch. I am confident that an intruder could roam my yard at will, do as they will to the cars in my driveway, as long as they don’t climb onto my porch. Well, I can go to Live View and watch every movement, but the Ring Video Doorbell Pro will NOT detect and alert me.And that myth about me actually speaking to the person on the porch? Well, the ghost of that ship has done sailed, honey, far out into the sunset and ne’er to return. Only the Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Home Improvement Salesmen are willing to stay on my porch after they have rung the doorbell, waiting while it takes 10-15 seconds for the alert to hit my phone, and then the 2-5 minutes it takes for the video to become available for me to view. So no, my expectations were not met.So, I will keep the new porch light, my wife likes it better than the old one. And I should have moved that mailbox long ago, it is much easier to empty in its new location. And I’ll keep the new doorbell transformer, it is a sturdy, handsome fellow even though it is buried beneath an AC return duct and 16 inches of powder insulation.But my old doorbell is going back on my porch, and this Ring Video Doorbell Pro is going back to Amazon. It is too unreliable, and does not, can not, WILL NOT work as advertised.\n', ""\n  When I first got the device in July we immediately installed the product. Install went great and was super easy. For the first month the product worked great. We were super happy with it and even purchased the extra service through them to save our videos for longer. Shortly after that we started getting constant motion detection alerts. Sometimes it was something blowing by but more frequently it was simply the camera shifting from night vision to day vision for no apparent reason triggering a motion detection alert. Then for whatever reason in the end of September it simply quit working.I have tried to contact the company but was told that I needed to verify the make and model of my chimes (only have make no model on them). They said there was nothing they could do. Now I am stuck with a doorbell that doesn't work and service I can't use because they couldn't verify the chime compatibility. Nowhere in the installation instructions was their anything about a chime compatibility and I am not sure that has anything to do with why it quit working.Save your money and don't buy anything from a company who doesn't stand behind their product.\n"", '\n  This works well. The install is easy. I have one very major complaint. The blurb on Amazon does not explain that you have to pay for a cloud subscription to store and retrieve the short videos of motion events. The promotional material and install instructions are structured such that you do not catch this ¨gotcha"" until the unit is installed and you use it for a day or 2. There is no provision to store these videos locally on your own computer. I am giving this just one star because they are not up front about the need for a paid subscription and the lack of a local event video storage option.\n', '\n  [October 2018 Update]Revisiting my review once again, making it 4 stars.  My doorbell would randomly die after someone pressed it, rendering it useless until I reset the power.  I decided to reach out to Ring and after a very brief conversation they offered to send me a replacement device right away.  Once I received it, I quickly noticed that it was the same in the front but completely different hardware in the back.  I swapped out the old (sent it back to Ring), installed and setup the new (very easy to do by yourself), and for the past month+ it has been working very well.  None of the issues I had been experiencing with the original unit have since resurfaced with this new unit.I\'m glad I decided to reach out to Ring for support on this and was very appreciative of the support I incurred including the replacement device.[JUNE 2018 UPDATE]Well, my Ring Doorbell Pro died this week.  It had gone offline about 3 months ago... then again about a month ago... and now it\'s completely dead.  Previously I would go through the reset / setup procedure and it would come back online.  Now there\'s no lights, etc.  Apparently it\'s a ""known issue"" according to Ring.  Read the numerous reviews here.I understand electronics are not necessarily meant to last forever, but a $250 weather sealed doorbell that sits in a sheltered environment should last much longer than 2 years.  In addition, the fact that Ring claims it\'s a ""known issue"" means that they are aware of a design flaw.  The flaw could be hardware or software, but a flaw means it\'s their fault.However, since they only provide a 1 year warranty, I suppose that makes it my fault..  Not a single person who\'s reviewed this issue and had any luck with support on this issue.Support did call me back to advise me to disconnect and reconnect the ring pro to see if that would work. Others who have tried this indicate that it\'s just a matter of time before it will fail again though. I had to try 3 times before it properly reset.I\'m not going to hold my breath.  Buyer beware - if you have money to burn, it\'s a fantastic device while it is working.  I for one will do my research and see if there\'s a better alternative available while I wait to see if this one dies.[ORIGINAL REVIEW]One day while I was out running an errand my ring app on my phone notified me that someone was ringing the doorbell.  I don\'t always answer, but decided to.  The young man at my door seemed a bit \'off\' and asked for ""Nick"".  There\'s no one named Nick on my street... or in the small area where I live.  I told him he had the wrong house and the guy left.  Few minutes later I could not shake that something was off, so I reviewed the entire video footage - Ring captures motion so I was able to see what he did prior to ringing the doorbell.  This guy was wearing a hoodie so he covered his hands, looked through my front door window for a good 5+ seconds, then started to check the door to see if perhaps it was open, before deciding to ring the doorbell... all with his hands covered.  It was 70 degrees out.  Once I answered, he seemed shocked and he quickly pulled up his hood.I contacted the police and they filed a report.  I shared my Ring video with them and they said it was the cleanest video they had seen in some time.  Less than two weeks later a detective called me to let me know that the guy who came to my door was indeed looking to burglarize my home.  He had been arrested and put in jail for other area burglaries.  The detective said that had I not answered the doorbell, my home would most certainly have been broken into that day.I\'ve had the ring doorbell since September 2016 and this was the first and only time something odd/suspicious was captured and, to say the least, it works!!!Now onto some of the issues I\'ve had:1.  Ring initially was recording very poorly and sometimes would not capture video properly if at all.  I installed a high end wifi extender nearby and problems went away.  Previously my wifi signal strength was about 40% at the doorbell location.  Now it\'s close to 100%.2.  My Ring doorbell went offline and it took me who knows how long to realize it.  The app has a health monitor - RING why are you not telling me that you\'re offline???  Why do I need to discover it for myself????  Getting it back online was a bit of a hassle also.3.  Angle.  I now see some angled plates for sale but would have liked to have had those when I installed it.  It\'s perpendicular to my door, which means I am not capturing as much motion as I would like.  Someone needs to be on my porch before it starts capturing motion.  With an angled plate, I could catch them coming up my walkway instead, which is more useful.4.  Costs $30/year to maintain recordings.  If I install additional devices, it\'s an additional $30 per device.  Would have liked to get a price break.Overall, great product.  Not sure I\'ve seen a better one on the market.  As with any tech, there are always likely to be issues somewhere.  Overall, I think this is a good product and well worth the peace of mind.\n']"

Video quality is adequate but not great.  It's good enough to see what is happening at your door.*************We have a couple security cameras already but they are wired to an NVR recording box and the notifications are so slow or don't even send that I can't really rely on it for real-time notifications.For a while I've resisted the notion of paying for surveillance when I can just get a cam with built in SD storage and a nice app like the Wyze cams (which I have inside and love) but having motion and video alerts and footage that can't be stolen or storage get corrupted and a well made phone app is worth $3 a month.  I also like that if I decide to add more Ring cameras I can add as many as I want with the 10 dollar plan.  Take notes here Nest.As for the doorbell itself, install was straight forward.  I did have to upgrade my transformer for this.  I installed the Endurance pro 24v unit.  It was only a few bucks more than the 14v devices which apparently are the bare minimum Ring recommend. I figured that the extra voltage gives me some headroom to add a smart thermostat if I decide to do that in the future and after discovering how much of a pain it was to access my doorbell transformer in the attic, I'm glad I only had to do this once.  Make sure you locate yours before deciding on this model doorbell or the Ring 2 which would have been at least an hour or two shaved off the install time.Once I setup the motion detection zone, basically all false positive alerts are gone.  I have the motion detection setting in the middle of the 5 settings.  Lowering it doesn't detect the postman at the mailbox despite it being in the motion zone.Notification on my phone is instantaneous.  I tested while walking up to the door and it had notified me and I had pulled up the app before I even got to the door both when connected to my home wifi and when on LTE.  The remote chime installed without any issues as well.Speaking of home wifi, this seems to be a big sticking point for some owners.  I used an android phone app to measure signal strength at my door and it was around -60db (the closer to 0, the stronger the signal).  As a network engineer who has implemented numerous small business and commercial wifi installations, for reliable video streaming, I would say if your signal strength at the door is -65 or closer to zero, you're good.  If it's higher than -65 like -70 or -75~80, I would strongly recommend investing in upgrading your home wifi with a decent mesh setup like google's wifi, Orbi or EERO mesh.  This will allow you to have a wifi access point closer to your door offering a much stronger signal for the doorbell to connect to.  Wifi range extenders are hit or miss. They're less expensive than upgrading to a mesh setup but those have to piggyback off your existing wireless instead of just being a part of it and is generally more trouble than it's worth for the average user to setup.The final piece of this working well is your internet speed both upload and download.  If you are in a rural area with less than a 10 Mbps connection down and less than 2 Mbps upload, you will probably not have the best experience as this thing is both having to upload/stream video data to Ring's servers and your phone is having to stream/download it from their servers.  Ring's video is not that high of bitrate (quality) but still needs to stream that data to their servers before you can even download/see it.If your ISP is metered, you need to be aware that the doorbell is constantly sending video footage.  Mine has uploaded 600 megabytes of data in 4 days.  At that rate, it will transfer about 4.5 gigs of data in a month.  If your data is capped, be sure that you have the headroom to allow the doorbell to stream video footage.  FYI it needs to stream this because if something is triggered, that portion of the stream is probably flagged as something you should see and it snips the motion detection part of the stream and sends it back to you.  This is why you see your activity video and at first nothing happens and then you see whatever it is that triggered the motion alert.  It was recording before it actually saw something move.The only real gripe I have is that sometimes when you open the app to view an event that just got recorded, the app will say that it's processing and not available to play yet.\n"", ""\n  Like one of the other reviewers, our ring pro doorbell worked well for 30 days and then kept disconnecting from the wi-fi.  Following troubleshooting through the app, we performed a hard reboot which got the ring back up and running...temporarily.  Every morning for a week, we did a hard reboot (not recommended by the way) and every night that thing disconnected from the wi-fi between 10 pm and midnight.  So contacted Ring customer support.  The first person we spoke with was not super helpful and I was convinced that he was just giving me a run around.  But we called back and got someone different....way more helpful.  Sent email pictures and instructions to help us locate the doorbell transformer.  Ours was on the side of our electric panel and was a 16/15 V.  Tech support person suggested upgrading to a 16/30 V.  We did and so far so good.  The Ring doorbell instantly fired itself back up after installation of the new transformer and has not disconnected from the wi-fi since.  Here's the link to the transformer we got:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GND8RMQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n"", '\n  Bought a refurbished Ring doorbell from Amazon.  Installed and it worked on and off for a week.  Then without warning it completely shut down.  Called Ring Support and found out that the MAC address was not provisioned correctly, resulting in a non-functioning unit.Ring Support did immediately ship out a brand new unit (not refurbished) which is not working properly.5 stars to Amazon and Ring Support for fixing the issue, but the initial product gets 1 star.\n', '\n  Worked great for 30 days then will not stay connected to WiFi and customer was no help. Don’t recommend product\n', '\n  nothing on this thing worked as advertised.  low voltage oh? replace transformer, disconnect rear door bell, buy interior chime bypass kit, buy replacement rechargable door bell chime.  oh wifi weaj? buy wifi extender!  it was never ending.  calked tech support.  dismal.  first tech promised to get back to me after she requested i send her pictures.  never heard back.  found out from second tech that she did nothing with my issue!  i also bought a first gen. battery powered one for back door....  no problems with that one...  hmmmm....\n', ""\n  Ring apparently has two versions of the Ring Doorbell Pro. One which I received is the older model and is prone to burning out when connected to a low power doorbell transformer. I would say stay away from Ring doorbells if you do not have an upgraded transformer.  They burn out in a few weeks and Ring will not ship you a new one, warranty doesn't cover that type of failure. I'm going with the Nest Doorbell instead.\n"", '\n  The refurbished unit came in a sealed box, in mint condition. Everything needed for installation is included in the original box. My old doorbell already had a 16V transformer right inside the junction box behind the chime. I installed the Pro Power kit V2 and then replaced the old bell button with Ring doorbell pro. Ring app installed quickly. Very happy with the purchase.\n', ""\n  I bought this simply be able to know what's happening around the kids...I went to the Doorbell Pro as I wanted it hardwired so I never had to deal with batteries. If you have an already wired doorbell, then be sure to buy the correct transformer to insure it gets proper voltage.I am going to buy one soon for my mom who lives alone, so I know intercede if someone tries to cold call her (which has happened) so that I can answer the door for her...indispensable piece of mind\n""]"
