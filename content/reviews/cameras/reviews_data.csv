I have an iPhone, but thought an actual camcorder would be more versatile.  No way.  The video is not very high def.  Will not focus on anything close.  The flash may or may not come on when you push the power button.  The zoom is not fluid.  It literally jumps from one position to the other.  The start and stop video is on the  back of the camera and is hard to reach.  Honestly, my iPhone 3 did a MUCH better job.I purchased it because it had such high ratings, but it is not a good camera.  My iPhone 3 literally did a better job a recording videos.\n', ""\n  Great unit if you are only doing video, and you don't need to zoom in very far. Photo quality when taking standard point and shoot photos is pretty poor, so not a good dual purpose model if that is what you need. As for video, if you are doing YouTube tutorials or how to videos where you have a large frame of view, ie 4 feet or more - video quality is great and the microphone gives a fairly high quality sound. Excellent for taking in landscapes and wide/pan views. However, if you need to zoom in on fine details like a close up of how to find/apply something and the frame of view is 2 feet or less (ie a hand screwing in a bolt or applying nail polish) the video quality drops dramatically - especially if you have to use the zoom function. To be completely honest the zoom function is basically useless and gives a blurry image no matter what, even in still photos.

It shoots HD video and also has Wifi, allowing you to upload your photos directly to your phone.

Check them out!\n"", '\n  I take thousands of pictures from the back of a motorcycle and have had many cameras. Several of them were Canons. The main thing that I liked about this one is that it is smaller, more lightweight, and the 50 X zoom. BUT, it seems like all they did was put a cheap $50 camera into a Canon body. When you press buttons, it makes a strange ""spring"" sound. Really bothers me. Also, the power button placement is a complete fail. It is in a very inconvenient place. Hard to manage with one hand. Awkward! My last camera had the option of having a 30 minute window for the power save before shutting down. This one only has a short time. Traveling down the road, I have missed many good shots because the camera had shut down! Frustrating! I would return it, but it was a gift from my husband. The zoom is the best feature. Otherwise, I would suggest getting a better camera. Or just get a cheap pocket camera.\n', ""\n  I bought this for my wife who wasn't quite ready for a full on DSLR camera. She just loves this camera for its ease of use and for the high quality pictures it takes. The built in telephoto lens takes excellent close ups of the wildlife she likes to shoot. She has gotten many, many compliments for some of her pictures and she has only had it a month or so. I would highly recommend this camera if you are not quite ready for a full on DSLR camera, but you still want high quality pictures.\n"", ""\n  So far, I love this camera. My old - and by old I mean I purchased it in 2008 - Powershot died. It was a great camera and served me well.  So when I had to buy a new camera I looked around quite a bit. I kept going back to the Powershot because I loved my old one so much, and I can't spend $400 or more on a camera. It just arrived the other day, I charged up the battery, and so far I am really impressed! I will update this in a month or so. Most of the pictures I take are for eBay, our business Facebook page, grandkids, etc.\n"", ""\n  Bought this for wildlife. You need a monopod when zoomed all the way in but, even without, you can get some great shots. I used my 7D to shoot some engagement pictures for a friend. Took this one along. Some of the pictures rivaled the 7D. The lens on the 7D alone cost me way beyond this camera.I don't like is the lack of a view finder but for the price? The screen is the all you have and if you're not in focus it can take you several seconds to find your target. It will take some getting used to. It's also light. I think that's good but I'm not yet sure. All the pictures were taken without a monopod and zoomed in really tight. I never have the monopod when I need it.When I first went to start it nothing. Would not power on. I had charged the battery to full and it just wouldn't turn on. I googled and found others had the same issue. Stuck the battery back on the charger for ten minutes and it fired up perfect and hasn't stopped. It's a great camera for the car or ATV. You can hike with it and not know it's there.I'm happy.\n"", ""\n  I love this camera! It's everything I wanted! Brings things right up to where I feel I can almost touch it!  You can take pictures fast with it too.. no lagging\n"", '\n  Then camera is light and convenient to use.  The manual could use more details, like most of them.  I prefer an eyepiece to look through rather than relying on the digital screen.  Sunny days are very hard to see what you are going to photograph.

No satisfaction dealing with them, the camera cannot be used.will not be purchasing another Canon product\n', '\n  VERY Happy with this camera.  I was looking to update from a basic ""point & shoot"" without spending a ton of money in the process.  After some research, this camera is absolutely perfect for people looking to delve into photography a little.  It has a huge amount of options available including the unbelievable zoom feature, you really can capture the craters on the moon!  You can also simply leave it in ""auto"" mode and take fabulous pictures using only the zoom feature to get great shots.  I find it a great size for carrying on hikes or travelling, the strap is a little flimsy and I would advise looking into the many wrist strap options available.  I would also advise a back up battery, many inexpensive options available.  While experimenting and learning this camera, I have already taken many photos that look professional and I\'ve printed and framed.  The close ups that you can capture of stills, wildlife, people or scenery are unbelievable.  I did a lot of research and comparing before I decided on this model and I could not be happier with my purchase, as usual ~ great service and delivery from Amazon and I think a very fair price.  I highly recommend this camera.\n', ""\n  I put many hours of research into this camera, a lot reviews, a lot of comparison's and so on. Yet if fails to meet my expectations on so many levels. For a $300 point and shoot camera I expect the camera to perform equal to a DSLR giving that I'm solely spending only this amount ON A CAMERA, whereas I spent $200 on my phone and it has better picture quality and you are given an operating system on top of that! WHAT?!?Here are the list of DISADVANTAGES or NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED FEATURES FOR A $300 price tag:- Does not shoot in RAW format- Picture quality is grainy (contains noise) because of JPG preset- Dynamic colour depth is embarrassingly low- Recording quality is poor- Thanks to the above disadvantages the 20.3 megapixel shots looks like 1080p shots rather than 5K- Autofocus system is difficult to control at times- Night shots are still poorly taken even with DIGIC 6+ processor to the point that I doubt even DIGIC 7 can do betterTHE ONLY ADVANTAGES:- 50X Optical Zoom- Shutter Speed Priority is amazing\n"", '\n  I like this camera for ease of use. Photo quality is beyond amazing, the ability to zoom in to things far a way is ... amazing!I was looking for a digital camera that was beyond usual budget cameras. Paying the extra (more than the $50) for a camera is definately worth the money.  I was able to purchase the extras for fraction of the cost had I had to purchase them separatly. I feel it was money well spent and would recommend Canon products based on this purchase.\n', '\n  On one hand, you have point and shoot cameras, and on the other hand you have professional cameras. If you only want to have fun taking pictures, you usually want a point and shoot camera. If you are interested in professional photography, well, you want a professional camera. This camera is a point and shoot camera, and for that type of photography, it does what you expect. However, if you only want a point a shoot camera, you will be as happy with a more affordable model. Either, you can spend a hundred less and get probably the same quality of picture with a cheaper point and shoot camera, or you can spend a couple of hundreds more and get a starter semi-professional camera.\n']"

I decided to try and take the lens from this newest red camera and put on my old silver one because the old one was better than the new one only it had a scratched lens. Well, it was extremely difficult to replace and was a complete bust! Both were worthless as they were so not a complete loss from trying but I woud no longer recommend this model again. It's crap.June 2019 - I do professional photography for a living but wanted a small pocket camera for hiking/traveling/walking and quick things around the house without dragging out a bunch of equipment. It fits in a pocket perfectly! I don't know about you but if I take my pro gear out on a walking, I never actually get any exercise, I just stand around taking photos in one or two spots the whole time. Lol. So — my view on this is it's not as good as previous point-n-shoots I've had. They used to be heavier, more sturdy, better made and less expensive. This one is lighter, tad flimsy, pricier than I'm used to (for the low quality) and not as good made. Comes with a rechargeable battery which is nice but I don't love it enough to buy a backup, although it does last a very long time, charged it for the first time after 2 months of use which is about 10mins every 3 days or so. Quality is so-so and many of the basic features and settings I'm used to on most other point-n-shoots are not on this camera or very limited. An amateur can take good shots with it but only if you have the patience on the focusing. It can take a long time for it to focus on what you are trying for. For example, say you are trying to get a butterfly on a flower, it may continuously want to focus on the ground rather than the flower/butterfly area (see photo of what I mean or looks like Amazon isn't allowing all my photos so not sure if you can see it). It does AMAZING macro shots most of the time though, it automatically focuses them (best without flash on) but other shots farther away or if trying to do something quick not as great, so give it time to focus. Not the worse quality shots ever but not best either. A tiny bit muddy/painted look if you zoom into the images at 100% (see photo of 100%). The video (one attached) is decent, actually does better than photo stills. It also does not turn off ALL sounds. The settings allow you to turn off many sounds but it keeps the shutter sound, beeps when focusing and there is no way to turn it off. Personally, I don't like the sounds. If I had to choose a pocket camera for hiking and traveling again, I would save a little more and not get this one. If I only wanted to take quick macros inside for products etc, this is the camera to have. I've attached 19 photos and 1 video straight from this camera without Ps edits. ~Happy Shooting~\n"", '\n  \xa0Okay. I gave it 5 stars because I love the camera itself and don\'t feel I should downgrade my review because of what the listing says. Also it wouldn\'t let me put in four and a half. But any buyer should know that the listing says that it comes with ""64"" of something regarding memory. It doesn\'t say 64 of what. Could be Kbites, could be Mbites, could be Gbites, could be raw fish or tooth faerie droppings. Who knows? Turns out there is ZERO. ZIP. NADA. So if you order one of these be sure to buy some memory because it is not included and the camera would be useless without it. Good thing I\'m a bit of a memory hog and bought an ""extra"" or I wouldn\'t have been able to use it at all until I ordered some.Another small thing that it won\'t do (and I hold Canon blameless for this) is that there is no way that I can find to put a live view from the camera onto my computer screen—as you would do with a web cam. I didn\'t buy it specifically to do this kind of thing so I\'m not let down but I do a bit of astrophotography and that kind of thing is nice. The screen is too small to tell if there is dirt on one of your lenses in the dark. It ruins the shot if you don\'t notice it and when you are trying to shoot a picture of the full moon and don\'t catch it you have to wait at least a month to set the shot up again.With those two things in mind it\'s a pretty good camera and I\'m happy I got it. The screen is easy to read. It\'s got a lot of the features that you would expect to find on a more professional grade camera. The menus are fairly intuitive once you\'ve spent fifteen minutes or so with the manual. I should be noted that you do have to download the manual itself because it only comes with a quick start guide. In Auto mode while shooting some pictures, like the moon for example, the exposure is a bit too high but I suspect there is a setting that would fix that, which I haven\'t found yet. In Program mode it\'s easy enough to correct that kind of problem, as it is pretty easy to take control of most of the other settings.I shot the attached video of the moon through my telescope because a picture is worth a thousand more words.I\'m still experimenting with it because I just got it yesterday but I\'ll update this if I think of anything else.\n', '\n  This point and shoot has been great to use and I have been quite satisfied with it considering its low price. I have attached test photos and videos so you can be the judge on the quality. I noticed that this camera is especially good at picking up accurate and bold colors in both the photo and video modes.Canon includes a ""Getting Started"" guide, a warranty card, a small lanyard, a 680mah battery, an external battery charger (which is nice if you plan on buying additional batteries), and the camera itself.With the popularity of smartphones, what is the appeal of this entry-level point and shoot camera? Well, unlike most smartphones, this camera features an 8x optical zoom. This is a great feature that allows you to zoom in decently close while experiencing a minimal degradation in quality. The camera\'s maximum video quality is 720p but it features quick auto focusing and as mentioned before, good accurate colors. The only issue that I had with the video quality is that the stabilization is not the best.Conclusion: This is overall a great entry-level point and shoot and I do not think you will be disappointed for the price. The 8x optical zoom is definitely my favorite feature and the photo and video quality is about what you would expect for a camera in this price range. There is no included SD card so you will need to buy one, and there is no included transfer cable (mini USB) so you will also need to buy one of those to load the photos and video onto your computer unless you have an SD card slot. The user interface on the camera is easy and simple to use. This camera is great for those who are not extremely technologically savvy as there is basically no learning curve. Nice job Canon.Disclaimer: I purchased this product with my own money for my own personal use.\n', ""\n  I'm not much of a photographer, so not qualified to write a big review. But I will say I've been having fun with this little camera. It takes a decent snapshot and it's pretty easy to use.One tip for new users... This camera has some interesting features hidden away in it's menus, so you might want to spend a few minutes  getting familiar with them.UPDATE Dec 26, 2016:Although I found no mention of it in the documentation, a friend showed me a trick with this camera that has helped enormously. It has a two stage shutter button... if you press very gently it will click to the first position where the camera calibrates itself. You can stay in that mode as long as you need to.  Then, pushing the button the rest of the way will take the actual picture.  As soon as this was pointed out to me, my  admittedly ham handed snaps got a whole lot better.\n"", '\n  J\'ai acheté cet appareil juste avant un safari en Afrique. J\'avais un peu peur de la qualité de mes photos après avoir lu certaines critiques mais finalement, je suis bien satisfaite! Les photos sont claires, les couleurs sont belles, l\'appareil était facile à utiliser. Je n\'ai pas eu la problématique des ""photos embrouillées"" comme d\'autres ont eu. J\'ai pris environ 250 photos en 2 jours avant que la batterie doivent être rechargée. A noter que le cable USB pour brancher l\'appareil à un ordinateur n\'est pas fourni, ni la carte SD.\n', '\n  Es una cámara bastante compacta, con buena reacción y disparo rápido, la tienes lista para funcionar al instante, pero obtienes la calidad de fotografía de un celular de gama media, grabas video con resolución de 720. Es una cámara que puede ir contigo a donde quieras pero no esperes más por el precio, obtienes lo que pagas.Hago notar que el modelo que se muestra en la foto dice ""Made in Japan"" pero el modelo recibido está hecho en China.\n', '\n  We like to stick with cameras in this price range as we are rough on our gear. We have had this camera for around 2 years and have filmed a lot of video. The video and sound quality meets our expectations.  It can zoom while recording which not all cameras in this price range do. Battery life is still really good. It would be nice to be able to charge it without taking out the battery and using the AC adapter though. The only way we are able to charge it outdoors is to plug it into an AC adapter in the car or wired to a 12V battery.\n', '\n  What a pleasant surprise when it arrived earlier than expected. As yet, we have not had an opportunity to use the camera, but we are sure it will be fine. The one thing with this camera, the owner is required to remove the memory card to transfer pictures, also have to recharge the battery but placing the battery into a pludgin. Their previous model all you had to do was plug the camera into a USB port on our laptop and both functions were accomplished at the same time. Just different I guess.\n']"

I live in Seattle and she lives in Canada so I saw her 2 days ago and gave it to her. She got sooo excited at first and tried to take pictures. But all the pictures came out plain black or white. She opened the second film package and pictures came out black again.

Now I've got a pink paperweight.\n"", ""\n  I didn't expect the picture quality to be the best but 2 out of the 10 things of film would NOT develop.

I would recommend  to get this set and a case separate if you want a case so the case will be more fun. Overall the set was really good.\n"", ""\n  The camera is really cute and all but the picture it takes is not. Sometimes the picture appears to be blurry and darkened. It even might even come in black and white (the whole picture). The first picture you take is actually the lid (for me).  And when you take the picture, you have to wait a little longer to take the picture out. But even when you do these things, the picture doesn't even come CLOSE to my expectations. And the way it was described on Amazon was not the way it is. For example the selfie mode does not work at all. Overall, cute camera not cute pictures. :(\n"", '\n  This was a gift for my daughter that she enjoyed very much when it worked. We used the cartridge that came with the camera, and then bought a big pack for more fun pictures. We only did few and than the camera stopped working.

I have a cell that I can snap photos but sometimes i want something else.  This is a fun little camera that i can use and works beautifully.

The mini pictures are so cute only problem I have is that I bought the bundle with the 2 film packs and I got zero packs!

Buyers beware don’t get the bundle you will be sold short!\n', '\n  Super cute camera, BUT my package did not come wit ANY extra film.
