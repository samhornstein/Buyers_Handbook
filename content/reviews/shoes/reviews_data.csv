I was so happy with the delivery and how great these sneakers fit him.Thank you\n', ""\n  UPDATE: I’m keeping these. On learning further, I realized they are great running shoes. Started using these at my community gym. Great investment overall (~$50).Right off the bat, this is a great quality shoe.I just tried these on for quite some time and walked around my apartment.These have really good cushioning, seem pretty sturdy, the colors are nice and contrast one other well.I did feel this shoe is a little on the wide side (I too have small feet, I wear 7.5-8.5 US but still). Didn't find it to be a big deal but it's noticeable.The sole has patterned groves that I'm sure would provide a solid grip too. Should be great for running and other active usages.Yet to wear them for an extended length of time. Will update should anything change.\n"", '\n  He comprado para mi y mi hijo Steven diversos diseño de calzado de esta marca , como ya lo he dicho en otras ocasiones existe una tendencia a no tener una paridad en el size, pero en este caso en particular recomiendo que compres tu size que usulmente usas ya que para mi caso  es fiel a su talla, y finalmente agregó que estos si son realmente como se muestran en la imagen así que no se llevarán una sorpresa desagradable espero que esto les sirva\n', ""\n  Under Armour is quickly becoming one of my favorite shoes. Great style and they offer wide sizes which can be hard to find. This is my second pair and I'm already looking for my third pair. I'm in the 300+ category and anyone that is a member in good standing in that club knows that weight can destroy a shoe if you aren't rotating them. They last so much longer and wear so much better if you can do it. I recommend these for anyone looking for an economical good looking shoe that looks good and wears comfortably\n"", ""\n  My only other experience with the UA line of shoes were a pair of Charged Bandit 3s that I have now relegated to gym use.  Almost all my family's other UA products meet or exceed expectation, but I was slightly let down by those first pair of shoes.  They were not very comfortable and despite having HeatGear socks, they seemed to always keep my feet very hot.During Prime Day, the Charged Assert model came up at a very good price.  I decided to roll the dice since they were so inexpensive, I could also relegate them to gym use if I wasn't pleased.  Thankfully, this purchase is a different experience.  They are more comfortable when wearing them all day and they do not make my feet feel too hot.The jury is out long-term, but so far I am very pleased with these shoes for the price paid and also how they outperform the slightly higher priced (at the time of purchase) Bandit model.\n"", ""\n  I want a crisp pair of white, stylish, comfortable, and durable shoes.  This is almost the perfect pair.These fit as expected, are comfortable for daily wear or for the gym.  My issue with most styles of most brands is the white soles on most shoes.  White soles get filthy dirty and in my opinion distract from the rest of the shoe.  These shoes have mostly gray soles which will disguise most of the grime from use, but there is a portion that is left as white.  If the gray were darker or black and covered the entire sole, I'd give these a 5 star rating.\n"", ""\n  Update- I've put over 400 miles on these walking on pavement/gravel/dirt the past 3 months  They've held up well.  The pics are from today.  Stitching is in great shape and there's still lots of tread left.  It's not an aggressive tread design so these might be more suitable for walking than heavy duty trail running.  They're comfortable and I'm so glad I didn't buy cheap shoes.I've walked/jogged in these almost every day for the 2 weeks I've had them.  I checked out a bunch of cheaper shoes that had spiffy pics but only so-so reviews and felt I should spend a bit more to get a quality shoe.  Life is too short for cheap shoes.  Anyways, they fit well and they feel good, and I've had no issues with my feet yet.  Of course, I've only had them for 2 weeks so I can't speak about their durability.  If things change dramatically over time, I'll update this review.\n"", ""\n  This shoe looks so small. Doesn't fit properly. Knee pain and while running you will probably end up hurting your leg.

If you can get a pair for a good price, and just want them for the look then go for it, but I would not recommend wearing/walking in them for long periods of time.\n', '\n  I loved these shoes when I got them. They are true to size and very comfortable. I walk about 15 miles a week (taking my son to and from school), and my feet don’t hurt at all when wearing them. However, I’ve only had these shoes for a month, and the soles are almost completely worn at the ball of my foot. I am not doing any strenuous running or climbing with them, and I only walk on paved roads. I feel like they will be completely unwearable in the next few weeks. So I payed $50 for 6 weeks of wear...\n', ""\n  Love these shoes!!! I first discovered these at a local shoe store.  I'm normally a size 8 or 8.5 depending on the brand of shoe and the 8's fit me perfectly with thin (or no) socks.  If you wear slightly thicker socks, you may want to go up a half size. I promptly wore these for 3 days straight at Disneyland after only wearing them for about a week prior and had zero blisters!! They were so comfortable! When I got back, I returned to the store to buy the other 2 colors but was disappointed to find out that they did not have my size in stock. Amazon comes through once again! Found the other colors in my size with free Prime shipping. One other thing to note, these are more of a slip on shoe. There are laces but you don't need to undo them to get the shoe on or off.  There is no tongue like a normal shoe so the laces seem more like a decoration. They can tighten the shoe somewhat though if you feel that are too lose.\n"", '\n  I have the same pair that I purchased from a store. These were not the same quality and fit much more narrow.  Wondering if these are actually a knock off as they also had a weird generic tag.

Good for running around.\n', '\n  Worst running/walking/workout shoes I have ever worn. The inside of the show is made with a foam that does not breathe. The seams are jagged and if the shoes are worn without socks cause irritation immediately and blisters quickly. They have zero traction, I have slipped many times. They also have virtually no support. After wearing these for four weeks for evening walks my lower back and feet can take no more. I can’t return them but hopefully can warn you against buying them.\n', '\n  ""I love these cloudfoam shoes from Adidas! They fit perfectly, they’re light, perfect from working out, the tongue is built in so it doesn’t move around while you workout. I highly recommend this pattern as well!""That was my review the day after I bought them. All was fine and well at the gym. After 3 visits to the gym, running on the treadmill for 15 minutes, going 7mph for probably a total of 7 minutes out the 15, and then lifting for 75 minutes, I started to experience severe pain in both of my knees near my MCL. I tried to ignore it, thinking it was just sore muscles from working out. Then started my L ankle pain. It progressively got worse, and eventually I couldn\'t even walk anymore. I started to assume it was the shoes seeing as there is ZERO support from these shoes. I ended up returning them, and continued to work out wearing different shoes. The damage was done, and things got much much worse. I\'m a nurse, so I tried to just ice, take ibuprofen, and rest. That wasn\'t doing the trick so I went to my nearest urgent care. After 7 x-ray images, I found out I had severe tendinitis and swelling in my L ankle, and both of my knees. Thankfully it wasn\'t a hairline fracture, which I was thinking it may have been considering how excruciating the pain was. No gym for 2 weeks, ankle wrap, naproxen, rest, and icing was my treatment. Not a fun outcome seeing as I go to the gym 5-6x a week.IN SUMMARY: Do not buy these shoes if you intend to use them at the gym.\n', '\n  These shoes are so comfy, but way way too big. I tried three different pairs from Amazon, and all too big. Finally had to buy in a local store at 2 sizes smaller than my normal shoe size so I could get them in time. I recommend using Amazon wardrobe to try on multiple sizes if you have time to wait. I have a wide foot, and these shoes fully accomodate my feet with no rub or tension. The sole is cushioned, but not too squishy. The fabric is breathable mesh, and ideal for barefeet.\n', ""\n  The fit of the shoe is just right, however it makes me wonder if the product is authentic or is it a fake as one of the shoes (right shoe) is deformed and you can see the edge where it was glued in the front toe box and it makes it look very bad will try to fix the creases with some heat maybe it will help as the colour and design is beautiful and overall these runners would be stunning, it's just a shame that it was made very poorly\n"", '\n  Bought for my mum as a mother’s day gift. They arrived exactly as pictured. She says they’re very comfortable and super lightweight so perfect for her gym classes. All in all perfect gym trainers, especially for the price.\n', '\n  Very light on the feet.\n', '\n  I like all shoes from cloudfoam pure damen\n', ""\n  I wanted a pair of slip-on shoes and like my old Sketchers ones, but cooler. Ordered a size 7 and it was a touch too big. I wear a 7 in Nike and Sketchers and a 6.5 fit me better for these. There is no need for the laces as the shoe all stitched together as one piece. They are just slip- on. You can tighten them a little bit but the laces aren't really necessary. I find them snug against the top of the foot which I like. You can tie the laces up in a bow on the outside of the shoe (NOT like the advertised photo), but if you want them to look sleek and lace-less like the photo then you need to tie the laces on the inside of the shoe. This just keeps them out of the way and thats what I did.Note that the adidas tag is a light blue/ turquoise shade in the stitching and on the inside of the loop on the front and back pull loops.4 stars because the left shoe arrived with some plastic residue on the adidas branded tag on the front (pictured). Right one was fine. I exchanged for a size 6.5 that fit me perfectly and no problems with residue on the shoes.\n""]"

I actually saw them at rack room shoes first and would have bought them from there but they didn't have my size. I saw these in person and they looked great (no stain/dirty look on the front). I will say they do run small though, I've pretty much only worn Pumas for well over a decade now and I'm always a 7 but I had to go up to and 8 on these because my toes were mashed against the front.Unfortunately, I ordered a pair here on Amazon and the fronts (especially around the little holes) have this darker color that makes shoes shoes that look dirty/stained. I tried wiping it off with a damp towel in case it was actually just dirt but it's still there. It's not super dark or anything, but it does make these brand new shoes look a bit dirty and it's only on that front portion (tried to show in the photos but it's easier to see in person). I returned the first pair thinking it was a fluke, something stained it but the next pair I got had  pretty similar staining. I know these shoes shouldn't have that from already having seen them in store, so it is disappointing. I'm still keeping them because I do like the style and it's hard to find them in this color elsewhere but I definitely am not thrilled about the discoloration seeing as though they're brand new.

He does a lot of walking with lower back problems. These shoes are great for him. They help his back and supports his feet and hips. Great shoes. My husband had had 3 pair of them.\n', ""\n  These fit my small feet well, though they do have little arch support. They feel light and super comfortable, easy on and off. However, the bottom of the sole is a weird design with large/deep enough gaps that they pick up and hold on to every piece of gravel they can. I spent half my walk today pulling gravel out of my shoes! So these are great for indoors, but I won't be using them as my outdoor walking shoes unfortunately.\n"", '\n  My hubby has huge feet and it’s always so hard to find him good shoes that fit well! We usually end up having to buy whatever Ross has and the selection is always limited- IF they even have his size at all. I don’t know why I didn’t think of Amazon sooner(he loves these Skechers shoes! I love being able to show him multiple styles and colors of size 15 extra wide shoes and having him pick what he wants because he usually just has to get whatever he can. Not only do they fit perfectly, he also said “it feels like walking on clouds.” My husband is a 6”5 400pound former heavy weight champion.... good shoes matter! 😁👍\n', ""\n  I was hoping this would be a silver bullet for my foot pain. It did take longer to start hurting, but apparently I need to see a doc because if these shoes did not fix it.. it's not the shoes. These things are amazing comfy. Think of using a bag of marshmallows on your feet and you have an idea. It is made like the clogs material but 3 times thicker. It likely won't last for long mileage wise because of this, but if you don't put a ton of miles on them they should be excellent. Also because of the material they are about as anti slip as you can get. Almost to a fault actually. I ordered extra wide and got extra WIDE.. which is great since I am technically a double wide. They are good looking too. Probably too good looking for a guy like me. I wish they came in something that looked like a Keen hiking sandal so they would breath more for summer.. but that isn't really a flaw. Maybe the loop at the back could be a smidgen larger to make slipping them on even easier. Splitting hairs here for the most comfy shoes I am sure have ever been invented.\n"", '\n  These shoes are very comfortable and easy to get on, which is key for me. They also stay very well too. The width is perfect for my 4E wide feet. I find myself wearing these quite a lot. If I had to find a fault with them, I might have preferred the soles were a little stiffer, which I think would offer a bit better support. But hey, I’m wearing them to work all day, everyday, and liking them, so it’s not a big deal.\n', ""\n  Incredibly grateful that Skechers have persisted with their Goga Mat soles, and now they're air vented!!!!I suffer from something commonly known as policeman's foot - i.e. feet that ache and burn from excessive heat and pressure, something commonly experienced by policemen who are on their feet in hot and uncomfortable shoes all the time.So I really struggle with my feet, and these Skechers Go Walk Evolution Ultra-enhan Trainers with their GOGA MAT insoles bring my IMMENSE RELIEF, they really are like walking on clouds!!I've had other Skechers with GOGA MAT insoles before - which were also great, but then Sports Direct decided to stop selling them, and I couldn't find them again. Then in the mean time I bought myself other Skechers with memory foam insoles, which were SHEIT. So I'm incredibly glad I found these here on Amazon now.I've just returned from recycling where I went and dumped all the other shoes that were in my cupboard until these arrived just now, because I absolutely definitely wasn't going to wear any of them again.I'm seriously considering buy 10 pairs of these amazing shoes to keep in my loft just in case Skechers loses their way and stops making them, or Amazon stops selling them.[Skechers if you're listening; drop the crap memory foam insoles from your other shoe ranges, and just go with Goga Mat in all your shoes. You'll be doing the world a favour. PS and well done on making shoes for COMFORT when all the 'big brands' could possibly care about is looks and style. Not even Dr Martens with their 'bouncy soles' are anywhere near as comfortable as these shoes.]Yipeekayei!\n"", ""\n  These Skechers Go Walk Evolution Ultra-impec Trainers see true to size compared to an earlier pair of a similar design which came up a bit small. These are light, very comfortable shoes which are very light and really do cushion every step.The insoles which are curiously named Googa Mat work together with the air-cushioned soles to make these the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. The internal arches feature vents and, despite the uppers being a nylon type fabric, the shoes feel well ventilated and non-sweaty. I like the slip-on design which works well and the sole bumpers which protect the fabric. These shoes are hard to fault for comfort and seem durable.\n"", '\n  I find these are the most comfortable indoor outdoor slipper, I have neuropathy in feet from treatment, and these help cushion the feet as well as keeping warm in colder times\n', ""\n  Ordered based on previous reviews as I wanted something comfortable and hopefully would last. They wer'nt for running, just summer walking/casual etc. I have slightly wider feet and was slightly worried that they may be a bit tight, but I needn't have. They go on easily, fit well, and no excess movement when I walk around.Great quality, a little on the expensive side, but overall very happy and would recommend.\n"", ""\n  I have bought a number of different type of skechers in the past couple of years and would now buy nothing else. As quite a big guy with back issues I need shoes that are comfortable and stop jolting through the spine.These skechers are the best so far. Not only do they fulfil the brief they are hard wearing as well and have outlasted other shoes even with wearing them all the time. I wasn't sure what I was getting as there were no reviews for these shoes. Took a punt and haven't looked back. The only thing I can think of as a small issue is that the shoe entry slots are a bit narrow. Unless you have very wide feet, this shouldn't be a problem.\n""]"
