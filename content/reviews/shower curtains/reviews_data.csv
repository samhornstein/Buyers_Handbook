Purchased from the infamous ""W"" store (whose door I never darken again), I allowed it to accumulate mildew and soap film until it was physically revolting to take a shower.  I loved the many positive reviews for the LIBA SHOWER CURTAIN, so a few weeks back I purchased this item, and enthusiastically hung it in my tub.  I shower daily (sometimes more than once), and after several weeks the LIBA is just as clear, clean, and fresh as the day it was hung.

But so far so good!  I really lather up when I shower, so plenty of soap goes on this liner; thus far it looks as clear as the day it was delivered.  Clean and clear:  That\'s what a shower curtain should be.  Looks like the LIBA SHOWER CURTAIN is right on the money.~D. Mikels, Esq.\n', '\n  This is a fairly heavy plastic vinyl, with none of the toxic scent of most vinyl shower curtains.  No scent out of the package and none while showering.  I would give it 5 stars except that it only comes with 3 magnets and they are not strong enough to prevent billowing of the curtain while you are showering.  I sort of ""paste"" it to the tub by running the shower head the length of the bottom of it and this does a fairly good job of keeping it from coming lose and sticking to you (yuck!!!).  It was a good price, but definitely needs more magnets.  I asked the company if they made the same curtain with more magnets, or ANY curtain with more magnets, and, alas, no.\n', '\n  This is a great heavy duty shower liner. For the price, you get great quality, I only need to replace this about once a year and they stay in awesome shape. Would recommend.\n', '\n  Best shower liner I‚Äôve had\n', '\n  Bought based on positive reviews but was very disappointed in quality and feel.  This shower curtain liner is very rigid and not flexible and also seems short as I have installed on a standard height rod and it is only about 2"" tops into tub which may lead to water leakage.Will be returning.\n', ""\n  This product does what it says. I've had another brand of a mildew resistant shower curtain before this one. I kept throwing the old one in the washing machine to find that I've had to wash the curtain every two months due to mildew buildup that caused the area by my shower to smell awful. I finally had enough and looked for mildew resistant curtains on Amazon to find this one. I have had this curtain in my shower for over six months now, and I haven't run into any issues with mildew or mold. The curtain stays clear, due in part to rinsing it after every shower. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product.\n"", ""\n  Exactly what I needed. As described and on time. Now my Marilyn shower curtain is protected too. Also bought here one Amazon.  üòâPictures are a few monthes and it's like new. Sure it will last many years. And to the new house . Where I can actually benefit from metal magnets. But the none rust grommets are like new and we have dont ALOT of showering since we got it.Hope this helps.\n"", ""\n  The pictures pretty shows that this is not a liba product. Typos, not peva rated, no magnetic bottom and flimsy material.I wouldn't suggesting buying from this seller at all.

I have specialty shower curtain hooks and was unable to hook the curtain on them. Ended up tearing the plastic around the grommets so my hooks would work. The weights on the bottom are pretty much useless.  Why would I bother keeping it you ask.  Because I waited weeks, can\'t be bothered trying to return it and it\'s a lot better than what I had.  Still on a quest to find the ""perfect"" shower curtain liner but for now this one will do.\n', '\n  I love the shower liner! Stays in place!
