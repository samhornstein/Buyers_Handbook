I was very pleasantly surprised, the LED's look great and really accent the bar!\n"", ""\n  I originally purchased a more expensive LED light strip with remote control.  However it was returned because the lights did not reliably respond to the remote control and the electronics got extremely hot to the touch.I purchased these since everything was included and the price was very inexpensive.  Everything worked great!  The lights were very easy to install, they always respond to the remote control, and they don't get hot!  Excellent product and you cant beat the price.My only negative remark is that there are no instructions included on how to program your own scenes with the remote control.\n"", '\n  \xa0This lighting is quick and very easy to install. Just make sure that you clean the surface well, plan your project and apply the item only once. I do recommend installing the item in a location where it will be hidden when not in use. It can look a bit ""tacky"" if it is too noticeable when not in use. I have a very old stairwell that gets extremely dark at night. The last step, at the bottom, can be a mess as it seems to be a bit shorter and can cause a person to trip in the dark. üò°ü§ï These lights make the stairwell safe at night.

The LEDs were adhered directly to unfinished pine boards.  The adhesive is really strong and didn't have any problems sticking to the wood.  My kids love the color change features.  There is plenty of adjustability to the brightness.  I have tried the custom settings and probably won't.  The preset colors work well for my needs.

I ordered the 65ft pack because I wasn‚Äôt sure how much I needed and It comes on 2 rolls. Super easy to put up, all you have to do is peel the backing and stick, the tape is pretty heavy duty. You can cut the excess off on the special markings, but once you cut it there‚Äôs no going back.

All in all a good value and would highly recommend this product.\n', ""\n  These are very good LED strip lights and definitely the best I've used. They are very long so very good for doing a whole bedroom. The remote control is very good and they gave so many options. The only downside is you have to make sure you put the IR receiver somewhere easy to point the remote two because you need to point the remote at the IR receiver for it to actually pick up your signal. These light were also very easy to install, the 3m tape was a joy to work with and I just used Loctite blue tacky to mount the IR receiver and AC power converter right to my wall.\n"", ""\n  Is it horrible to say I hate these lights?

The remote has several standard colors and settings (flash, jump, fade - slow/fast), and also has 6 options for programing your own color scheme. You can even brighten and dim the lights. Instructions as easy. Quality excellent. **Tip for installation: Start from the outlet your going to plug the base into. That way you can gauge the distance from the outlet to where you want your starting point of the lights to be.I didn't want the base to be visible and luckily my son has a outlet near the window in his room. I plugged the base in and used Command Strips (not included in packaging) to adhere the base components to the wall leading up from the outlet and behind the curtain on his window. It did not reach the ceiling (which is where I had planned to place them) - it was actually about 4 inches shy of the ceiling. Taking this approach saved me a lot trouble (since the cording on the base didn't reach that far) and actually looks better than it may have had I applied them to the ceiling. The room looks so much larger now.\n"", '\n  I went through 3 other kinds like this. One broke after i hung them up. One had too few lights, meaning they were 65 feet but the lights were spread out further apart not putting out as much light as these. One set came looking like nothing pictured in the description.After the headache and returns, I found these and they are the good ones. Bought 2 of them and they go all the way around my downstairs townhouse. Was worth all the trouble in the end. Look really nice and create a cool vibe even if used with other household lights.Oh, these also hold up well on the wall too, where I had other lights fall and had to use tacks to keep them up.

The lights spaced perfectly apart, and the remote is very responsive. The DIY section is awesome, you can program it any way you want.\n', '\n  \xa0This review is for the ‚Äú65.6ft Led Strip Lights, Tenmiro Ultra-Long RGB LED Lights Strip 5050 LED Tape Lights Flexible Color Changing LED Lights with 44 Keys IR Remote for Bedroom, Kitchen, DIY Home Decoration(4X16.4ft)‚Äù sold by NIGHTSPARKLEIncluded in the box is a remote, a power-brick style power supply (12v DC 5A), 4 spools of LED Strip lights, the IR based controller, an IR remote (with 4 legs to connect the 4 strips to), connecting hardware, and a small brochure.The lights on the strip can be set on a good array of colors.  When selecting a color or pattern, the same color and pattern goes across all 4 strips.  These LEDs are NOT individually addressable.  If you want to have that functionality, like light chasing patterns, or each LED to be of a different color than its neighbors, then you need to look at a different style of LED Strip (look for DREAMCOLOR or ‚ÄúChasing LED‚Äôs‚Äù in the descriptions).The lights are NOT WEATHER PROOF or WATERPROOF.  These lights were designed to be in an indoor configuration as the diodes for the LED are simply surface mounted and exposed to the environment with no protection on a carrier strip.  So behind a TV, under inside cabinets and molding, and accent lights for a room or under a bed would be a great place to put these.The adhesive on the strip looks to be ‚Äújust barely strong enough‚Äù to hold it in place. So if you intend to have it mounted for a longer time, I would suggest looking into adding or replacing the adhesive that comes with the strips or using some mounting hardware or dedicated LED strip mounting channels. If you want to beef up the adhesive, 3M makes great adhesive tapes for this need.The strip itself is basically a flexible circuit board where the diodes and other surface mount components are affixed.  The LEDs are 50x50mm and each LED carrier contains separate diodes for Red, Green, or Blue in the physical package.  While this configuration does give great color for the 3 primary colors, giving combinations of colors (like an orange, or a yellow, or a white) is not as pure as what you might be expecting, but all in all still pretty good. The strips have cut areas about every 6.5‚Äù so you can trim the length of the strip to match most desired lengths.  Each section has 3 LED packages on it, giving an equivalent of 3 Red, 3 Green, and 3 Blue LED‚Äôs per strip.  There is no additional ‚Äúwhite‚Äù LED (cold or warm) on this strip.If you do choose to cut and splice, make sure you get the 4 conductor connectors for LED strips. It is possible to buy extra connecting hardware to splice back in cut lengths together ‚Äî however, I would suggest keeping the total length of one powered run as what was provided by the factory ‚Äî unless you can engineer in more +12V power supplies.  From what I have seen as ‚Äústandard issue‚Äù, a 12V 1.25A supply should power 1 leg of 5M (16.5‚Äô) of LEDs.The Remote is Infra-Red ‚Äî you have to point the remote at the IR LED that comes off the controller.  If you don‚Äôt have a clear line of sight between the remote and the controller, you won‚Äôt be able to control the lights.  If you want to have it so that you can control it via Radio signals, look for a replacement controller that does support RF operations.This controller is NOT MUSIC / SOUND sensitive.The Power supply is sufficient to power the four included rolls of LED Strip lighting with no apparent issues. The power supply cord from the wall to the power brick is a little on the short side ( about 18‚Äù ) and the length from the power brick to the barrel connector was about 3 feet ‚Äî and is as usually expected for a generally sourced 12v 5A power adapter. It is 2 pronged which is typical for the US power grid, and this version did not have interchangeable power connectors in case you wanted to install these in UK, FR, etc.So, again, these strips function as specified, so no issues there.  Just make sure that these give you the ability to get you the quality of light you need and only use these indoors in an average humidity environment.\n', '\n  \xa0Works perfectly! Very bright and is adjustable if I want it dimmer. Many colors to choose from and very responsive. The adhesive seems very sticky and didn‚Äôt come off easily so I‚Äôm expecting it to stay on for a very long time.\n', ""\n  \xa0i received the light about a week ago and I really like them they work so good and they're really easy to use. it has a lot of different colors that you can control with its remote and with these lights my room looks very colorful. 100% recommended\n"", ""\n  As part of her room redecoration, my daughter wanted to add strip lights around the entire ceiling. I was happy to find set that was actually long enough for the entire ceiling without having to find strips to add to it.

I put the plug behind my bed and i have to point the remote right at the sport where the plug is to change the colors. I'm not sure if this would be as big of an issue if you left it open, but i wanted to hide the cords. Over all, i really enjoy these lights and like being able to have whatever color i want in my room.\n"", '\n  \xa0Got these lights to spruce up my room. Very easy to install and operate.

I bought this one because it was one of the cheapest options that also offer a good amount of length for the RGB strips compared to other sellers. Amazing lights and easy to install! They stuck to surfaces really well and even if I messed up on placement they were easily removed and adjusted. The remote allowed me set up my own styles of lights and having it sync with my music made it great for nights of vibing to music. The lights are also bright and colorful and really worth the money. Friends of mine complimented on my lights even though they have their own because some other ones do not shine as well or have different problems.\n']"
