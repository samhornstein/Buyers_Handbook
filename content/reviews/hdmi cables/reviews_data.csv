For having put through what I have gone thru I would rate these as garbage!!! Grrrrr!!!\n', '\n  Please do not waste your hard earned money on overpriced HDMI cables in the name of picture or sound improvements. I currently am using these AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI cables to connect our Yamaha v379 AV receiver to other HDMI enabled devices that link back to our 4K Samsung Smart TV and these have performed flawlessly.HDMI cables come in four types: Standard-speed --> Standard-speed with Ethernet --> High-speed --> High-speed with Ethernet. Since High-speed cables are so cheap (e.g these AmazonBasics cables), there really isn\'t any point of getting Standard-speed anymore. On the other hand, as most HDMI devices today can\'t receive Ethernet over HDMI, High-speed HDMI cables are really all you need.** Some numbers **Standard-speed HDMI cables are rated up to 1080i (""i"" stands for interlaced). In order for a HDMI cable to have a ""High-speed"" moniker, it must be capable of showing resolutions up to 4K --> 3840 x 2160 at 30fps (or 4,096 x 2160 at 24fps). And as the highest resolution any 4K TV currently on the market can produce is 3840 x 2160 at 30fps, even if you found a $100 cable at your local BestBuy that claims it can transmit much more than that, it doesn\'t matter as you are limited by your source (i.e your cable box, Xbox, PS4 e.t.c) and your TV\'s hardware capabilities.Also HDMI cables can either produce an image/sound or nothing at all. There is NO in between. Therefore, a HDMI cable will either work or won\'t work (it may show a flashing image but this means it\'s a bad cable). But a more expensive HDMI cable will NOT show darker blacks and sharper colors than a less expensive HDMI cable. You either get 100% of the signal or no signal at all. Now if you intend on running your HDMI cable for more than 50ft, then you might want to invest in a HDMI cable that has ""active"" chips that help maintain the signal quality over a longer distance (but does NOT make the image/sound any better than the source).** What about HDMI 1.4 or 2.0 or HDCP 2.2? **This is another common misconception due to manufacturer marketing. HDMI 1.4, 2.0 and HDCP 2.2 are all hardware changes that do NOT require a cable change! Although there is a difference between them (you can google that yourself), there is no such thing as a HDMI 1.4 or 2.0 or HDCP 2.2 cable! The version numbers refer to the devices that the HDMI cable connects into & NOT the cable itself. The cable simply is a pipeline linking the two. Hence, if you do happen to own a TV and another device that both have HDMI 2.0 ports, any AmazonBasics High-speed rated cable will work perfectly fine with it.** Conclusion **At this price point, there is very little reason to spend more money on more expensive HDMI cables over these AmazonBasics High-speed cables. If you have a 3D, 4K, HDCP 2.2 or HDMI-ARC compatible device, these High-speed cables will work perfectly fine for you.\n', ""\n  Updating my review, I bought this 3 pack and while the first cable worked fine on 4K 60fps signals, the second and third cables has major issues.I had bought these to replace my older AmazonBasics high speed cables (10.2Gbps), however after purchasing a XBOX One X, those cables would not allow the XBOX to work in 4K. I had a similar issue with my Roku Ultra which would not work with the 4K 60fps setting. I decided to try these as they are rated at 18Gbps. While the first cable I tried worked flawlessly (no artifacts, flickering or other issues), the other two did not work as well. I tried Twisted Veins HDMI cables as well and had similar issues. I finally picked up Monoprice cables and haven't had any problems. Most people have good luck with these cables in shorter lengths (6ft or less), however at 10ft or longer I recommend looking for something else if you are using these on a 4K display. The two issues I saw with these cables at 4K 60fps were sparkles or repeating signal loss.\n"", ""\n  Amazing cables at an affordable price. Tested with 4K HDR and Dolby Vision. Works with Apple TV too. I have this HDMI cable going from my Denon AV receiver to my LG OLED TV and all my devices hooked to my AV receiver using this HDMI cable as well. Everything works great. Don't listen to the reviews that said Dolby Vision doesn't work on the Apple TV. They probably didn't set up their AV receiver and TV settings properly. The TV and the AV receiver has a setting that is listed as HDMI Deep Color or HDMI Enhanced that you will need to enable for HDR and Dolby Vision. Also it is prefered to set up the match settings under the video settings for the Apple TV.\n"", '\n  Necesitaba un cable hdmi y no me quería gastar mucho dinero.

Il est également bien flexible.Pour ce qui est de l’image, elle est parfaite et très stable, je n’ai noté aucune perte de signal… tant qu’on ne lui en demande pas trop.En effet, tant que l’on se cantonne à un signal 4K (3840x2160) en 30Hz, il n’y a aucun problème, l’accès à la gamme de couleurs complète et donc au HDR est possible. Par contre, dès que l’on veut aller plus haut (50 ou 60 Hz), il devient impossible d’aller au delà d’un signal YCbCr 4:2:0, la bande passante du cable est trop faible. Ce qui en résulte est une perte de la plage dynamique y compris en 8 bits (limitée à 16-235 plutôt que 0-255) donc des couleurs ternes et une image peu précise. Pour profiter d’un signal YCbCr 4:2:2, 4:4:4 ou encore RGB, il faudra passer par un câble avec une meilleure bande passante.Pour résumer :1080p - 60Hz : YCbCr 4:2:0 OK / YCbCr 4:2:2 OK / YCbCr 4:4:4 OK / RGB OK1440p - 30Hz :  YCbCr 4:2:0 OK / YCbCr 4:2:2 OK / YCbCr 4:4:4 OK / RGB OK1440p - 60Hz :  YCbCr 4:2:0 OK / YCbCr 4:2:2 NOK / YCbCr 4:4:4 NOK / RGB NOK4K – 30Hz : YCbCr 4:2:0 OK / YCbCr 4:2:2 OK / YCbCr 4:4:4 OK / RGB OK4K – 60Hz : YCbCr 4:2:0 OK / YCbCr 4:2:2 NOK / YCbCr 4:4:4 NOK / RGB NOKCela dit, cela ne concerne qu’un signal au delà de 30Hz donc pour la majorité des utilisations, cela ne posera pas de soucis. Un film étant en 24 images par secondes, votre lecteur passe normalement sur du 24Hz, de plus, sur un film, ce genre de compression de l'image a peu d'impact. Dans ce cas précis, il est parfait. Pour du 1080p, il est également parfait, son rapport qualité prix est imbattable. Cela posera plus de problème pour un joueur comme moi qui voudrait connecter son PC à une TV 4K HDR et profiter des jeux à 60 fps.https://www.rtings.com/tv/learn/chroma-subsampling pour plus d'informations.\n""]"

I’d say about double or even triple the thickness of a standard HDMI cable.Not a negative review by any means, just a warning for other potential buyers who thought the braided cable would be thinner than a standard cable. It is very thick and heavy, definitely nice but not what I was expecting.\n', '\n  Perhaps i got a defective one, but this listing very clearly says its capable of doing 4k @ 60 and mine definitely was not able to. I messed around with the settings multiple times, used the windows settings and nvidia control panel, researched possible solutions online, but no matter what i did, every time i tried  changing it to 4k higher than 30 it would not show any picture. I tried another shorter amazon basics cable and it worked at 4k @ 60 no problem. Even after testing the shorter cable and plugging this one in after with the same settings, it would not show picture until i plugged in the shorter cable again, turned it back down to 30, and then plugged the longer one back in.If you dont need that exact setting, it worked fine. However, i would mention that the plastic around the connector is so large that it might make it difficult to solidly connect to a device that for some reason has its hdmi port recessed a little too much.I will try returning it for a replacement and update my review if the next one works.\n', ""\n  Worked Great but about two disconnects and reconnects, the computers I've used (I've used many) it stopped detecting the computer.  Plug in Plug out many times and finally it worked. Painful when a room full of folks are expecting a presentation.

And trust me, I didn't bend this cord a lot or anything. It's passed the return period by 3 days....I wish I had returned it. I was holding out like the cord wasn't that bad and now it won't connect at all and I've only had it for a month\n"", '\n  Would work great, but it is too thick for my needs. I was looking for a cord thinner than a pencil, this one is as thick as my finger.In one place the weight is shown as 0.71 lb. Another place says 11.4 ounces, which could be the same. Another place says shipping weight is 1.9 pounds. HOWEVER, this must be the weight of the 3 foot size. This 25 foot cable felt more like a 5 lb sack of flour. Way too heavy for what I need.Amazon was great about accepting this as a return. The return should get five stars.\n', '\n  Have you ever thought to yourself, ""I\'d love to use an HDMI cable to tread a tank""? This might be for you.The outside casing is incredibly tough, which is both good and bad; it\'s rather stiff and resistant to bending, but that means that once you get it the way you want it, it\'ll stay there even if your cat happens to jump up and hang from it (trust me). Also, works perfectly well for transferring HDMI data.\n', ""\n  Originally I bought a 25' HDMI. The write up did not mention that the rubber was so thick and tough that it would not make turns easily.  I bought 2 of the 10' to do the job and the braided cable makes turns easily and so works with the laptop and receiver.  No problems with the audio or video so all is well.\n"", '\n  Exactly what I needed! I am a Fleet Trainer in a Cruise Ship and I needed a reliable HDMI cable to connect my PC to LCD TV/ Projector. I prefer the braided cable because it is so flexible to run them around my devices and the HDMI cable from Amazon Basics did just that! I am happy with my purchase and I rest my trust to Amazon Basics products.\n', '\n  Wir hatten 2 Kabel bestellt um unsere PCs mit unseren Bildschirmen zu verbinden. Der Hauptgrund für diese Kabel war das gute Preis- Leistungsverhältnis. Sie kamen gut verpackt bei uns an. Jedes Kabel ist in einer Pappverpackung verpackt (siehe Bild 1) auf der dann jeweils die Länge (hier ca 3,04m) vermerkt ist. Wenn man die Verpackung öffnet sieht man das aufgerollte und mit Draht in Form gehaltene HDMI Kabel (siehe Bild 2). Auf den HDMI Adaptern sitzen Schutzkappen damit diese nicht beschädigt werden können (siehe Bild 3). Auf dem vierten Bild zeige ich nochmal genauer wie das Muster der geflochtenen Schutzschicht aussieht. Die Bild- und Tonqualität der Kabel ist hervorragend und ich kann nur zum Kauf raten.Wenn ich helfen konnte würde ich mich über positive Bewertungen freuen.\n', '\n  Does what it says. You really have to pick to think of anything wrong with this (perhaps the plug casing design is a little dated, for example) but it feels like a decent quality, it looks decent and it just plain works.Many people don’t understand that HDMI is digital so it will work or not and if it works it will give the exact same picture and sound as any cable at any price. Based on that, I don’t think you can beat this.\n', '\n  Ok when I ordered this I didn’t realise how thick this would be.  It’s similar in thickness to a cable that comes with your iron. Must admit this is a serious lead and for the money amazing value. Currently connecting pc to 4K LG tv and no issues so far.\n', ""\n  As a system integrator and AV installer I've installed hundreds of HDMI cables and found out the hard way that paying more for cables doesn't always yield better results.These Amazon Basics cables are well made, heavier gauge HDMI cables with a throughput of 18gbps.  The specs say they will support 4K video at 60 Hz.  So far I've hooked up Samsung, Sony, Sharp and LG TVs without any issues.  I've used these cables with Shaw and Telus Set Top Boxes, Marantz and Yamaha AVR's, Apple TV, PS3&4, XBox One, and other various devices,  again so far so good.These cables are thick, but not too thick.  They are fairly flexible and generally fish easily through conduit or inside walls.  Some HDMI Cables have oversized connector heads on them which sometimes creates problems with overcrowding ... not so with these Amazon Cables.  The HDMI Plugs are a little larger than some 1080P cables I used but they are still small enough to fit into most receivers and TVs.Overall these Amazon Cables are a good value and work well if your cable run is 25 feet or less.  I still use more expensive HDMI cables sometimes for high end installations with large budgets or in cases where I need a cable length longer than 25 feet.  (I wish Amazon made these cables in a 35-40ft length).I highly recommend these cables and will continue to buy them when needed.  Simply put ... they just work!\n"", '\n  A good quality cable, we’ll built and supports the latest technology. Not really much more to say with regard for the quality as it’s a digital medium.The cable itself is quite flexible and has smallish connectors which is handy if you’re aiming for clean cable management.\n']"

I also didn't to buy a new set of cable that would have to just get replaced with the next upgrade. Switching to a HDMI 2.1 cable was a no brainer. Once i replaced the HDMI cable between the 4K Apple TV to the receiver and from the receiver to the TV with these HDMI 2.1 cables. Dolby Atmos 4k HDR at 4k 60 PFS immediately worked and has been flawless. They were also the best value on Amazon, had great packaging, protectors on the HDMI connector and came with telco cable ties. Highly recommended.\n"", ""\n  I got this for my upcoming Xbox series x to connect to my LGCX OLED TV. I'm testing on my Xbox one X that currently has HDMI2.1 output as well and on movies and games that support it the difference is stunning on my OLED compared to a 2.0. This is a well-built cable and is doing the data transfers I had hoped for.\n"", ""\n  Just added two of these HDMI cables for my new Hisense 4K H9G and Sony UHD 4K Blue Ray Player. Beautiful picture. These are rated for 8k TV's so I can't comment on that type signal.  The cable is not thick, but in the old days of HDMI cables that was more marketing hype than anything. I have no doubt these are properly shielded and are very flexible for coming out behind you Entertainment Center from your Cable Box to TV.  Can't beat the price.\n"", ""\n  I really enjoyed the simplicity of the packaging. There were no gimmicks or complications when opening the package. An HDMI cable is pretty straightforward; all you have to do is, in my case, connect the Apple TV box to the HDMI port on the TV through this HDMI cable and you get awesome imagine quality on the tv! I really enjoyed this item! It works just like expected! There wasn't anything damaged or mishandled when inspecting the item. There's nothing much to say about the details like displaying 8k or 120fps as I don't have an 8k tv nor am I using this cable to play video games so I can't tell you if they work for that. I'd suggest to get this cable just to future proof yourself for the next 10 years. Thanks for reading!\n"", ""\n  I was getting message on my DirecTV television that my TV no longer supported HDMI input that I had to change to component cables. After talking to a person at DirecTV I found out that the FCC was putting a stop to all 1.4 HDMI cables because of pirating. So I ordered this cable which is in the picture from this company and it was delivered very quickly. I installed it on my TV today, it's a 2.1 and it's unbelievable, the picture is even better than my previous 1.4 cable. The cable is exactly what the distributor said it would be and thanks to Amazon's great service it was here in 12 hours and I am now back using my large screen TV again. Great cable and great service and I would recommend this to anybody who wants to upgrade their 1.4 cable\n"", '\n  I have always thought hdmi cords especially expensive ones were a gimmick so I never bought anything fancy but my old cord went to crap on me so I needed a new one (obviously) so looked through a handful and than I found this one with a lot of great reviews and relatively cheap so I wasn’t expecting much, well I was surprised when i plugged it in an turned on the tv an PS4!!!!!! What a difference like night and day and I didn’t have to spend 100 bucks to achieve it either definitely recommend and I will be buying more for every tv in the house.\n', '\n  I bought two of these cables. I needed a 2.1 HDMI cable for my Apple TV 4K. I was using a normal high speed probably a 2.0, I have my settings on Dolby Vision 4K 60Hz, and the signal would cut out intermittently. Once I switch out the old cable with this one, the problem was solved. Shipping was fast for me too.\n', '\n  It’s hard for me to describe or assign value to something of this nature. There are no issues with the sound or picture quality. It does exactly what it’s supposed to do. It’s not so much that it stands out, but that it doesn’t stand out in any negative way. I’m confident that you will hear and see exactly what you are supposed to see and hear. Now as far as the price goes,; you could pay much more for a very fine HDMI cord. You won’t hear a difference. Maybe there is someone out there that can hear the minutiae of sounds the rest of us can’t, I don’t know. Free up the money you would over pay on an HDMI cord, and purchase one of these and use the extra money in Vinyl, or separate pre-amps or even upgraded speakers. You just don’t need to spend it here.\n']"

But the angle connector adapter...is kind of useless.  It's upside down for every HDMI port on every device I've tried it on (TV, monitor, laptop, streaming box, DVD player) so it's unusable.  But the adapter was just a freebie, not a factor for the purchase decision - the price and the color marked cables were the deciding factors.  And those are completely acceptable.\n"", ""\n  Update: I bought these less than 2 years ago, and one by one I have thrown them out when dropouts occurred with a variety of different equipment.  I suspect these cables are just not up to spec.  They are so much thinner than other hdmi cables.  This has happened only a couple of times with a dozen or so different hdmi cables I have owned over many years so these are significantly worse than average.  I now buy bluerigger and have not had issues.Original review:I had occasional moments when the image would go to digital static then disappear, when I used one of these 6 foot cables to connect my Macbook Pro to an LG OLED 4k TV.  It worked most of the time, but the dropouts would happen after about 10-20 minutes on average.  I switched to another much thicker HDMI cable from another brand, and have not had the dropouts.I suspect that the small diameter of these cables is a sign that they aren't quite up to spec for high bandwidth 4k connections.  However I have had no problem using these cables for connecting my 4k Roku or 4k disc player, so most people probably won't run into the issue I did.\n"", ""\n  Well firstly they came extremely fast, and was packaged really well. The leads look great and the extras you get with them are such a bonus. The connectors are tight to my tv and box and I must say the picture in HD is awesome. However the leads are slightly thinner than the last one but dosnt mean it's lesser quality. I dont know how long they will last so I gave durability a 4, but for the price and what you get for that price why would anyone pay double for 1 lead let alone 3....great buy and would recommend and would use this seller again with out a doubt.\n"", ""\n  I am reluctant to give 5 star reviews too often, because usually something can be improved but these are hdmi cables so there is a level of expectation that comes with the purchase.First, these do work with 4k, so more or less there isn't anything you are likely to do these cables wouldn't be appropriate for.  Their price is very competitive while still being more or less the best you can hope for in terms of quality.  Will the cables break with wear and tear?  Most definitely but I have never heard of or seen a cable that didn't, so if the cables are all going to wear out then the thing you're looking for is reasonable quality at a reasonable price.  I would argue these cables more than accomplish that goal and even come with some extras that could help retain longevity of the cables.So for what they are and what you can expect I feel confident I can call these five star HDMI cables.\n"", '\n  The different colors made it perfect for following what system was what when connecting to the TV. My wife thinks it awesome so she can now check on the connections her self without my help...lol.\n', '\n  I found there is a difference between the old HDMI cables and the new HDMI cables. When I set up my new Yamaha TSR 7810 AV receiver with a new 2018 model Samsung LED TV the old cables that I had would not work the ARC feature. I replace the old cables with these cables it works perfectly. And there is a notable improvement in the sound quality. The cables are also thinner which helps in taming the rat nest of wires in the system. The color coding is fantastic.\n', ""\n  I thought all HDMI cables were essentially the same, but I just had a new Samsung 4K HD TV mounted the wall, and the TV installers said I should have bought 4K cables. Higher bandwidth = better quality image. Most broadcasting isn't in 4K yet, but why buy older technology? These cables are 1080p, which will work just fine, for now. I tried to return these, but Amazon wanted to charge me almost as much for return shipping as these cost to buy in the first place. If you don't have a new TV, these are a great buy.\n"", '\n  2 of the 3 cables had the metal HDMI connectors ripped off the cabling. This is a lack of quality control and/or just a garbage product. I needed these cables delivered this week for an event I am organizing. Guess I have to go to an actual store to buy what I need.\n', '\n  This cable package is a great value.The three different colour coded cables makes it easy to confirm what’s hooked to what.The right angle connector is a must when connection clearance is limited.The Velcro cable straps help keep cables tidy.The 6’ cable length is just right for most of my connections and they are not too thick which makes them easier to manage.They work well at 1080 60p.Very happy. I’ll order some more soon.\n', ""\n  Ne résiste même pas a ma télé HD ni mon lecteur Blu-ray, me fait perdre le signal de son et image a plusieurs reprise, J'ai investigué plusieurs jours avec mon distributeur (câble fibre), puis avec mes appareils, pour découvert que c'étais les câble HDMI de mauvaise Qualité.
