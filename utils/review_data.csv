  Bought 2. My Ocean & Earth and Dakine bags disintegrated in the hot California sun! I learned my lesson. Take care of my boards AND my bags! They aren't exactly cheap!1) 6' x 22"" bag.  For my Fish 5'10"" x 21"" x 2.5""2) 6'6"" x 22"" bag.  For my Fish 6'4"" x 21"" x 2.5""Feels like my old bags, quality. I don't take my fins off, too lazy so it fits very snug. Barely fit, lol. But that's how I like it :) I did ask them, they said ""no"" but I didn't get the reply until after I ordered it. No patience, haha. Good thing it worked out. Probably be good for travel too. The name tho... lol.

  I bought the 10-foot bag for my longboard (10'0""x24""x3.5"").  It's very, very uncomfortable to take out from the bag a ten-foot board because the zipper only opens the bottom half of the bag (the zipper only goes from side-to-side of the lower-half of the bag).  If you're in a sandy beach it's no problem, in the sense that you rest the board's tail in the sand and pull the bag from the front; but what about rocky beaches?  Or a concrete driveway where you want to rinse the board?  This bag requires two people to manipulate a longboard!Also, if you want to rinse the bag itself with tap water it takes forever to dry, because in the top half of the bag there is no opening.That same length of zipper could have been placed along a single side of the bag, and then the bag would pretty much open like a book, and then entry & exit would be a breeze.  It's seems crazy.

  Just got a 5'7"" ""Long board"" for summer swell in Hawaii, and my regular short board bag couldn't quite fit it with the fins. Saw this board bag, and decided to try it.  Great value for the price. Well made. Allows for expansion at the tail to keep the fins on, the rounded nose easily accommodates the nose of this board, and the carrying options are great. The clips used on the arm strap are actually really well designed. I expect they will hold up better with their spring loaded clip style (vs the plastic push-in kind).  Overall great design & great bag for the price!

  Certainly adequate to protect the new 6'6"" fish. I got the 7' bag since I'm mostly just throwing it the back of the truck and driving a few blocks to my main surf spot with fins on. I cannot see where the thickness will be an issue for just about any application outside of air travel.I really like the two pockets. I usually have to carry a backpack with phone, glasses, etc. Not only can I keep a couple bars of wax literally in hand before stepping in the water instead of remembering to grab before leaving, but keys, phone, go pro, etc. I really like the second hidden pocket with velcro on the inside of the bag so feel safer leaving it on the beach.4 instead of 5 because I have not tested the durability. One of the zippers on the outside pocket was off the track too, but back and forth seemed to fix that. Just hope the main zipper is durable.

  This surf board bag has a near 5 star rating for a reason.  The price is far less than the big name brands, it is available on Amazon Prime, it has great features, sturdy construction, and looks great.  The quality of the stitching, edging, zippers, fabric and other materials is much better than I have seen in other bags at this price range.  The protective padding throughout is good enough for airline travel (of course I always use pipe insulation for extra rail protection in any bag).  The nose and tail sections of the bag are reinforced with heavy duty fabric and extra padding.  The inside of the bag has a velcro pouch for fins and small items.  The outside of the bag has a large, heavy duty zipper pouch that can fit a wetsuit, etc.  I have read other reviews that suggest the zipper is short.  I disagree.  The zipper on the 6.0' bag runs nearly half the length of the bag...more than sufficient.  I can't speak for the length of the zippers on the longer board bags.  The zippers are heavy duty with nice pull cords on them.  There is also a unique padded zipper flap that protects your board rails from the zipper.  The handle is sturdy cordura style fabric with fabric covered padding.  The shoulder strap is durable, adjustable, removable and has good padding.  The clips that attach the shoulder strap to the bag have a very unique, heavy duty, corrosion proof plastic design.  The 6.0' bag has a curved nose end and broad square tail shape to fit a wide variety of board shapes up to 6 feet in length.  It has no problem fitting my sub 6.0 boards with fins on, and I think it will fit a 6 foot board with fins on as well, but I don't have a board that length to test it.  Once again, the materials and workmanship have a very premium look and feel.  The last bag I had that was built this well lasted me 18+ years.  I am convinced this board bag will perform well and last a long time.  I love it and will definitely buy it again for my other boards.

  I use this bag for my 6’3” lost rnf redux. It’s a wide fat hybrid fish and this bag fits it perfect. I have extra room for padding if I wanna travel with it and I can even throw my fins/wetsuit, towel, poncho, changing mat and everything I need in the bag. I even use the top zip pocket for my wax and a change of clothes. It has pretty thick padding and is really a high quality bag. If you are thinking about getting this bag do it. You for sure won’t regret it. I’m about to buy 2 more for my other boards

  I gave this a 5 for being a good, basic day board bag.  I like that there's enough room for wider boards & a little extra length, so the zipper won't rub (directly) on the boards.  I got the 6' 0"" board bag for my ""hybrid"" boards that are between 5' 9"" - 5' 11"" x 19 1/2"" - 20 1/2"" & they all fit quite well.  Now, if you're looking for a true travel bag.......I would recommend something more heavy duty.  Overall, the quality seems good for the price, but remember.....I gave my rating for this being a day bag.

  The bag fit my new board fine.  Someone left a previous comment that the bag is quite thin.  It is not made to be a travel bag, but a day bag for protection to and from the beach.
